psychological level and the various treatments that peer-reviewed
studies have revealed can help prevent and treat depression. I explain
the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression:
norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic
predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and
cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss
inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review
8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding
depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival
certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against
depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more.
I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and
psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I
review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression,
especially treatment-resistant major depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a
Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. This month, we're talking all about disorders of the mind,
things like depression, attention deficit disorders, eating disorders,
schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. During the course of this month,
we are going to discuss the psychological and biological underpinnings
of mood disorders of all kinds. You'll learn a lot of science. You'll
also learn a lot about the various treatments that exist and that are
in development for these various mood disorders. We will talk about
behavioral tools, things like exercise, meditation, breath work, but
also prescription drugs, supplements and novel compounds that are now
being tested in various clinical trials. Across the month, I think
you'll start to realize that there are common pathways underlying many
mood disorders. In fact, mood disorders that look quite different from
one another often depend on the action of the same neurochemicals or
neural circuits in the brain and body. That actually should be a point
of great relief because what it means is that by understanding the
biology of one mood disorder or understanding how one treatment or
behavioral intervention can impact a mood disorder, we gain insight
into other mood disorders as well. As always, we will discuss science
and science related tools that people could implement should they
choose. Before we dive into today's topic, I'd like to discuss a very
particular set of scientific findings that relate to today's topic,
and that are important for understanding all mood disorders and all
states of motivation, happiness, and sadness, as well as depression.
Basically, I'm going to paraphrase a brief segment of my discussion
with Dr. Anna Lembke, who I sat down with to discuss addiction and the
biological basis of addiction and addiction treatment. A very
important aspect of that discussion was when Dr. Lembke described the
pleasure pain balance, literally the circuits in our brains that
control our sense of pleasure and pain, and ultimately whether or not
we remain happy in our pursuit of pleasure or not. This is an
absolutely crucial aspect to the way that we function in everyday
life, and especially under conditions of mood disorders. The pathway
that she was describing is the so-called pleasure system. However,
what most people don't realize is that the pleasure system is also
directly associated with, and in fact is the very same system that
modulates mental or psychological anguish and pain. Essentially what
she described is that whenever we pursue something that we think will
bring us pleasure, and that could be anything that we think will bring
us pleasure from food, to video games, to sex, to a particular job or
goal, short-term or long-term, that we experience release of the
neuromodulator dopamine. Now, dopamine is associated with increased
levels of motivation and drive. It is not the molecule of reward, it
is the molecule of craving motivation and drive. However, as Dr.
Lembke pointed out, when we are in pursuit of something, there is a
release of dopamine in our brain that makes us feel motivated, and in
general, it makes us feel good. But very shortly thereafter and
beneath our conscious awareness, there is a tilt of the pleasure pain
balance in the brain, literally a shift in the neural circuits that
underlie pleasure and pain, such that every bit of pleasure or
pleasure seeking that causes release of dopamine will be balanced out
by a little bit of pain. And we don't experience this as physical
pain, at least not at first, we experience it as craving for more of
the thing that brought us pleasure. Now, that sounds pretty good. You
get pleasure and then you get a little bit of pain to balance it out.
It's subconscious and you experience it as the desire to seek out more
pleasure. However, it's actually more diabolical than that. And we
really need to keep an eye on this if we are to remain happy, if we
are to remain in pursuit of our goals. The crucial thing to understand
is that if we remain in constant pursuit of pleasure, the pain side of
the balance tips so that each time we are in pursuit of that
pleasureful thing, activity, or substance, we are going to experience,
we literally achieve less dopamine release each subsequent time. So we
get less pleasure and the amount of craving increases. Now, after a
certain point or threshold, we call that addiction. And the way to
reset the balance, and this is very important, the way to reset the
balance is actually to enter into states in which we are not in
pursuit of pleasure, to literally enter states in which we are bored,
maybe even a little bored and anxious, and that resets the pleasure
pain balance so that we can return to our pursuit of pleasure in a way
that's healthy, and then in an ongoing way, won't lead to this over
tipping or this increase in the amount of pain or addiction. So this
is very important. And if this seemed vague, what this means is we
should always be cautious of any state of mind or body or any pursuit
that leads to very large increases in dopamine. And if it does, we
should be very careful to not pursue that repeatedly over time. During
today's episode, I'm going to give an example, a real life example of
a discussion that I've been in with a young man who's 21 years old
who's dealing with a disruption in this pleasure pain balance. He is
essentially depressed and he's depressed because of his ongoing
pursuit of a particular activity that initially led to a lot of
dopamine, but over time has led to less and less dopamine and more and
more of this pain side of the balance. We could call him addicted to
that particular activity. Whether or not he's addicted by clinical
standards or not, really, isn't important. What is important is that
he experiences this as depression, as low affect as it's called or
anhedonia, an inability to experience pleasure from that thing or from
anything else. And he's currently undergoing treatment through a
rebalancing of his pleasure pain pathway. So while I can't reveal his
identity to you, that wouldn't be appropriate. He did give me
permission to reveal the general architecture of what he's coping
with. And I spent some hours with him on the phone this week, talking
to him as well as to the various people that he's working with to
really understand what's going on here 'cause I think it can
illustrate the relationship between dopamine, pleasure, and pain for
sake of addiction, but also for understanding how to avoid depressive
states, how to remove ourselves from depressive states. And as you'll
see today, as we discussed depression, many of the molecules and
neural pathways and biological mechanisms that we know can be used to
counter depression, feed back onto this pleasure pain balance. Before
we begin, I'd like to say that this podcast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is
however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science and science related tools to the general
public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of
today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is
a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from blood and
DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your
health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work
done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our
immediate and long-term health can only be detected from a quality
blood test. The problem with most blood tests, however, is that you
get information back about hormone levels, metabolic factors, et
cetera, but you don't really know what to do with that information.
Some things might be flagged as too high or too low, but really
interpreting those data and taking action to bring those numbers into
the ranges that you want is what it's really about. An InsideTracker
makes all that very easy. They have a platform, it's a dashboard that
will tell you for instance, what sorts of dietary changes or
supplementation changes or exercise changes will help you bring
various hormones, metabolic factors, and other factors into the ranges
that are right for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go

Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've
been using athletic greens since way back in 2012. And so I'm
delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens and that I still take Athletic Greens is that
it really covers all of my foundational nutrient and micronutrient
needs. It has vitamins, minerals, and the thing that's especially
important to me these days is the probiotics, because there are so
many data that show that having a healthy gut microbiome is vital to
having a healthy immune system and for healthy gut brain axis,
literally the functioning of your brain, your mood, various aspects of
brain inflammation or limiting brain inflammation are facilitated by
having a healthy gut microbiome. And that's facilitated by getting the
proper probiotics. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you can claim their
special offer. The special offer is five free travel packs, which make
it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road or in
the car, and a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Vitamin D3K2 have been
shown to have a number of different positive health effects on
hormones, on cardiovascular health, and so on. Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim their special offer. Today's
episode is also brought to us by Belcampo. Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California that raises organic, grass fed, and
finished certified humane meats. I don't need a lot of meat. Typically
my diet regime is one in which I fast until about noon, and then I
have a lunch which is fairly low carbs. So I'll have some piece of
meat or chicken or fish and some salad typically. And then in the
evening is when I tend to emphasize carbohydrates. That helps me be
really alert during the day and sleep well at night. When I do eat
meat, I insist that the meat be of the very highest quality and that
it is sourced in humane ways. Belcampo's animals graze on open
pastures and seasonal grasses, and that results in meat that is higher
in nutrients and healthy fats. There are now a lot of data pointing to
the fact that high levels of omega-3 fatty acids are vital for mood,
for cardiovascular health and various aspects of maintaining what's
called a healthy Inflammatone, the various things in our brain and
body that maintain a healthy inflammation response, but one that
doesn't go out of whack or get unchecked in any way that is
detrimental to us. If you'd like to try Belcampo, first-time customers

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=675"&gt;Major Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we're discussing depression. In particular, we're going to talk
about major depression. The phrase major depression is used to
distinguish one form of depression from the other, the other one being
bipolar depression. Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar
disorder, is really characterized by manic highs. So where people
aren't sleeping and they're talking very fast, and they're buying
things and pursuing resources that they can't afford, they're starting
relationships left and right, they're manic, followed by periods of
crashes of feeling very low, lethargic, and so on. Bipolar depression
is an absolutely crucial thing for us to discuss. And therefore we are
going to have an entire separate episode related to bipolar
depression. Today, we're going to talk about major depression, also
sometimes called unipolar depression, just because it doesn't have the
highs and lows. It's more characterized by the lows. We're going to
talk about the biology, the psychology, and the various treatments,
behavioral, drug, supplementation, diet, exercise, all of that. Before
we go forward into the material, I just want to emphasize that any
discussion about mood disorders carries with it a particular
sensitivity, and that sensitivity is one related to self-diagnosis.
Today's episode, and indeed in the future episodes for this month on
mood disorders, you're going to hear various symptomologies that are
used to diagnose and characterize these disorders. If you recognize
some of these symptomologies in yourself or in others that you know,
that's an important thing to take note of. However, accurate diagnosis
really should be done by a qualified healthcare professional. So at
once I'm saying, keep your eyes and your ears up for things that sound
familiar to you that might be of concern. And at the same time, I'm
saying don't necessarily leap to conclusions. Take those flags of
concern if they're there and bring them to a qualified healthcare
professional, and they'll be able to properly diagnose you as having a
particular mood disorder or diagnose somebody as having a particular
mood disorder or not. And that's an essential step. I don't say this
to protect us, I said this really to protect you. Okay, let's have a
fact-based discussion about depression. And I promise you that where
we don't know certain things about depression, I will be clear to tell
you. In fact, we are going to talk about some treatments for
depression that are looking very promising, and that right now are
actually being used more and more. And from my read of the mechanistic
literature, we're still a bit in the dark as to how these work. That's
actually a common theme of medicine. Many times there are treatments
that seem promising or that look really terrific. And there isn't a
lot of understanding about mechanism. However, any good discussion
about neuroscience and in particular about mood disorders, has to get
into mechanisms. So we're going to do that. And in doing that, we're
going to frame the discussion for the tools of how to keep depression
at bay and how to deal with it if you happen to find yourself
depressed, or if you know somebody else who's depressed. What is this
thing we call depression? Was I mentioned before, it has two forms,
bipolar depression, which we're not talking about today, and major
depression, also called unipolar depression is the other. Major
depression impacts 5% of the population. That is any enormous number.
That means if you're in a class of 100 people, five of them are
dealing with major depression or have at some point. Look around you
in any environment and you can be sure that a good portion of the
people that you're surrounded by is impacted by depression, or will be
at some point. So this is something we really have to take seriously
and that we want to understand. It is the number four cause of
disability. A lot of people miss work, miss school, and before then
likely perform poorly in work or school due to major depression. Now
there's a very serious challenge in having a discussion about
depression and it relates directly to the challenges in diagnosing
depression. Earlier, I did an episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who is
indeed a medical doctor and a PhD. He's a psychiatrist. And he made a
very important point, which is that the field of psychiatry and
psychology are confronted with a challenge, which is they're trying to
understand what's going on within the stuff that's in our brains
that's deep to our skulls. We don't have access to that without brain
imaging and electrodes and things like that. Someone just comes into
the office and the dissection tool for depression so to speak is
language. In order to determine if somebody has depression or not, we
have to use language, how they talk about things, also how they carry
their body. Also some general patterns of health. So let's talk about
depression the way that clinicians talk about depression, because one
of the issues is that we use the word depression loosely. A lot of
people say, "Oh, I'm so depressed. "I didn't get this job or I'm so
depressed. "I just don't know, I had a really rough week "or I'm
exhausted. "I'm so depressed or I'm so depressed "I thought I was
going to go on vacation "and then they canceled the flight." Okay.
That is not clinical depression. That's called being bummed out, being
sad or disappointed. Now that person might be depressed, but clinical
depression actually has some very specific criteria. And those
criteria are mainly characterized by the presence of certain things
and the absence of a few particular things. So let's talk about the
things that are present in somebody that has major depression. First
of all, there tends to be a lot of grief. There tends to be a lot of
sadness. That's no surprise. The threshold to cry is often a signature
of depression. Now that doesn't mean that if you cry easily, that
you're depressed. Some people cry more easily than others, but if
you're somebody who typically didn't cry easily and suddenly you find
yourself crying very easily, that could be a sign of depression. And I
want to emphasize, could. There's also this thing that we call
anhedonia, a general lack of ability to enjoy things, things that
typically or previously we enjoyed. Things like food, things like sex,
things like exercise, things like social gatherings, a kind of lack of
enjoyment from those things. Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad,
and sometimes it's just flat, it's just kind of neutral. It doesn't
feel good because nothing there. It's like bland food. It's like these
experiences are analogous to biting into your favorite article of food
and it just not tasting very good. It just doesn't taste like anything
at all. And that's a common symptom of major depression. The other one
is guilt. Oftentimes people with depression will feel very guilty
about things they have done in the past, or they'll just generally
feel badly about themselves. And we're going to talk about this
because it relates to some of the more serious symptomology seen in
depression sometimes, things like self harm, mutilation, or even
suicide. But for the time being, we want to frame up anhedonia, this
lack of ability to achieve or experience pleasure, or kind of a flat
affect as it's called. Sometimes even delusional thinking, negative
delusional thinking, and in particular anti-self confabulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=1120"&gt;“Anti-Self” Confabulation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is anti-self confabulation? Well, first of all, confabulation is
an incredible aspect of our mind and our nervous system. You sometimes
see other forms of confabulation in people who have memory deficits
either because they have brain damage or they have age-related
dementia. A good example of this would be someone with age related
dementia sometimes will find themselves in a location in the house and
not know how they got there. And if you ask them, "Oh, what are you
doing here?" They will create these elaborate stories. "Oh, I was
thinking about going to the shopping today, "and I was going to take
the bus, "and then I was going to do this." They create these
elaborate stories, they confabulate. And yet that person hasn't left
the house in weeks and that person doesn't have a driver's license.
And so they're really just creating this stuff. They're not lying to
get out of anything, they're confabulating. It's as if a brain circuit
that writes stories, just starts generating content. In major
depression, there's often a state of delusional anti-self
confabulation, where the confabulation are not directly or completely
linked to reality, but they are ones that make the self, the person
describing them, seem sick or in some way not well. A good example
would be somebody who experiences a physical injury perhaps. Maybe
they break their ankle, maybe it's an athlete, and they also happen to
become depressed. And you'll talk to them and say, "How are things
going? "How's your rehab though?" And they go, "Oh, it's okay. And I
don't know. "I feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker by the day.
"I'm just not performing well." And then you'll talk to the person
that they're working with, their kinesiologist or whoever the physical
therapist is. And they'll say, "No, they're actually really improving.
"And I tell them they're improving, "but somehow they're not seeing
that improvement, "they're not registering that improvement." You
notice that sometimes it's subtle and sometimes it's severe, but
they'll start confabulating. You'll say, "I actually heard you're
doing much better. "You're getting better, you're taking multiple
trips "around the building now "before you could barely get out of
bed." And they'll say, "Yeah, well basically, they changed some things
"about the parking lot that make it easier to move around. "So it's
not really me." And these aren't people that are just explaining away
their accomplishments 'cause they're trying to brush off praise. They
are viewing themselves and they're confabulating according to a view
that is very self-deprecating to the point where it doesn't match up
with reality. It's not what other people see and it's actually not
matched up with reality. And that's a symptom of depression that I
think we don't often think about or conceptualize enough. So it's not
just telling people, "oh yeah, it's not as good as it seems.
Everything's bad." These people really believe that and it becomes
disconnected from reality. So it's if they're sort of sinking into a
pit and they're losing touch with the realities of the world,
including data about themselves, their ability to move and get around
it, for example, in that particular instance that I used as an
example, but there are others as well. The other common symptomology
of major depression is what they call vegetative symptoms, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=1302"&gt;Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms of Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So vegetative symptoms are symptoms that occur without any thinking,
without any doing, or without any confabulation. These are things that
are related to our core physiology. The word vegetative, you might
know it sounds like vegetable. It actually relates to a system in the
body that nowadays is more commonly called the autonomic nervous
system. The vegetative nervous system and the autonomic nervous
system, historically were considered sort of one in the same. And it
relates to things like the stress response or to our ability to sleep.
So vegetative symptoms be things like constantly being exhausted. The
person just feels exhausted. It's not because they exercise too much,
it's not necessarily because of a life event, it could be, but they're
just worn out. They don't have the energy they once had. So it's not
in their heads, it's probably, and now I think we have good data to
support the fact that there's something off, something is disrupted in
the autonomic or so-called vegetative nervous system. And one of the
most common symptoms of people with major depression, one of the signs
of major depression is early waking and not being able to fall back
asleep despite being exhausted. So waking up at 3:00 AM or 4:00 AM or
5:00 AM just spontaneously and not being able to go back to sleep. I
want to emphasize that that could happen for other reasons as well,
but it is a common symptom or warning sign of major depression. So
let's talk more about sleep and depression. It's well-known that the
architecture of sleep is disrupted in depression. What's the
architecture of sleep? I've done entire episodes about this, but very
briefly in two sentences, although they're probably be run on
sentences, early in the night, you tend to have slow wave sleep more
than REM sleep or Rapid Eye Movement sleep. As the night goes on, you
tend to have more Rapid Eye Movement sleep. That architecture of slow
wave sleep preceding Rapid Eye Movement sleep is radically disrupted
in major depression. In addition, the pattern of activity in the brain
during particular phases of sleep is disrupted. Now this is during
sleep. So this can't be that people are creating this situation for
themselves. These are real physiological signs that something is off
in this so-called autonomic or vegetative nervous system. And then
there are some other things that relate to the autonomic nervous
system, but that we normally think of as more voluntary in nature. And
these are things like decreased appetite. So you can imagine that one
could have decreased appetite because of the anhedonia, the lack of
pleasure from food, right? If you don't enjoy food, then you might be
less motivated to eat it. That makes sense. As well because of these
disruptions in the autonomic nervous system, these vegetative
symptoms, as they're called, you can imagine that someone would have
decreased appetite because some of the hormones associated with
appetite, hypocretin orexin and things of that sort, ghrelin, that
those will be disrupted. And if those names of hypocretin orexin and
ghrelin don't make any sense to you, don't worry about it. What those
are just hormones that impact when we eat, when we feel hungry, and
when we crave food more, as well as when we feel full, we have enough
so-called satiety. If you want to learn more about those, we did
entire episodes on eating and metabolism. So you can see that the
symptomology of major depression impacts us at multiple levels.
There's the conscious level of how excited we are generally. Well,
that's reduced. There's grief, there's guilt, there's crying, but then
there's also these vegetative things. There's disruptions in sleep,
which of course make everything more challenging when we're awake. We
know that sleep is so vital for resetting. You're waking up early, you
can't get back to sleep. That's going to adjust your affect, your
emotions in negative ways. We know this. And appetite is off. And
there are hormones that get disrupted. So cortisol levels are
increased. In particular, there's a signature pattern of depression
whereby cortisol, the stress hormone that normally is released in a
healthy way only in the early part of the day is shifted to late in
the day. In fact, a 9:00 PM peak in cortisol is one of the
physiological signatures of depressive like states. It's not the only
one, but it is an important one. So there are a lot of things going on
in major depression. And by now you're probably thinking, goodness,
this is dreadful. Like there's all this terrible stuff. And indeed it
is terrible. It is a terrible thing to find oneself in a mode where
things feel sad, you feel guilty, you're exhausted. And oftentimes
there's also an association with the anxiety system. So just because
people are exhausted and lethargic and they don't enjoy things,
doesn't necessarily mean that there's an absence of anxiety. There can
also be a lot of anxiety about what's going to happen to me. Am I
going to be able to achieve my goals in life? Will I ever get out of
this state? And so things really start to layer on. And if this sounds
depressing to you, it is indeed depressing. This is really the place
that many people find themselves. And it's a pit that they just don't
know how to climb out of. So let's just take a few minutes and talk
about some of the underlying biology that creates this cloud or this
constellation of symptomology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=1618"&gt;Norepinephrine, Dopamine &amp;amp; Serotonin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's really important to do because if we want to understand
the various treatments, how they work and why they work and how to
implement them, we have to understand some of the underlying biology.
So let's spend a few minutes talking about the biology of depression,
what's known and what's not known. Because in doing that, I think
you'll get a much clearer picture about why certain tools work to
relieve depression and why others might not. So one of the most
important early findings in the search for a biological basis of
depression was this finding that there are drugs that relieve some of
the symptoms of depression. Those drugs generally fall into three
major categories, but the first set of ones that were discovered were
the so-called tricyclic antidepressants, and the MAO inhibitors, the
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. You don't need to understand that
nomenclature, but I'm going to give you a little bit of detail so that
if you want to understand it, you can. Most of this work took place in
the late 1950s and in the 1960s, and continued well until the 1980s
when new classes of drugs were discovered. And these tricyclic
antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors largely worked by increasing
levels of norepinephrine in the brain, as well as in the body, in some
cases. And they were discovered through a kind of odd set of
circumstances. We don't have time to go into all the history, but
suffice to say that they were discovered because of the exploration
for drugs that alter blood pressure. Norepinephrine impacts blood
pressure, and drugs that lower blood pressure reduce levels of
norepinephrine. And that in many cases, was shown to lead to
depression or depressive like symptoms. And so these drugs, these
tricyclic drugs, and the MAO inhibitors actually increase
norepinephrine. And frankly, they do quite a good job of relieving
some, if not all of the symptoms of major depression. However, they
carry with the many side effects. Some of those side effects are side
effects related to blood pressure itself, by increasing noradrenaline,
norepinephrine as it's called, you raise blood pressure. That can be
dangerous, that can be uncomfortable. But they also have a lot of
other side effects. The reason they have other side effects is because
they impact systems in the brain and in the body that impact things
like libido, appetite, digestion, and others. And we'll talk about
each of those in sequence. Okay, so the experience that clinicians had
of observing some relief for depression with the tricyclic
antidepressants and with MAO inhibitors was terrific, but there were
all these side effects, side effects that people really did not like,
they didn't like these drugs at all. A lot of people get dry mouth, I
mentioned the low libido, they'd have sleep issues, appetite issues,
weight gain. They made some people so uncomfortable that they
preferred not to take them, even though when they didn't take them,
they had a worsening or a maintenance of their depressive symptoms. A
decade or so later, there was the discovery of the so-called pleasure
pathways in the brain. These are pathways, literally groups of neurons
that reside in different locations in the brain but connect to one
another. So it's a circuit. And when you stimulate these neurons with
certain behaviors or with electrical stimulation in an experiment,
believe it or not, that's been done in both animals and humans,
animals and humans become very, very motivated to get more stimulation
of these pathways. So this pleasure pathway or these circuits for
pleasure are very what we call reinforcing. In fact, animals and
humans will work hard to get stimulation of these brain areas even
more than they will work to obtain sex, drugs, or even if they are
addicted to a particular drug and they are in a state of withdrawal,
the ultimate state of craving, if given a choice, a person or an
animal will select to have stimulation of this pleasure pathway
instead of the drug itself. And that is a major and significant
finding. This pleasure pathway, as it's sometimes called, involves
areas like the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area. These
are areas of the brain that are rich with neurons that make dopamine.
And if you think to the symptoms of depression, of anhedonia, lack of
pleasure, a lack of ability to experience pleasure, well, that was a
smoking gun that there's something wrong with the dopamine pathway in
depression. And indeed that's the case. So it's not just
norepinephrine, it's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway is somehow
disrupted. And then in the 1980s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=1910"&gt;SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there was the discovery of the so-called SSRIs Most people are now
familiar with the SSRIs, the Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors.
The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms from the tricyclic
antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors. As their name suggests, SSRI,
Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors prevent serotonin from being
wiped up from the synapse after two neurons talk to one another. What
do I mean by that? Well, here's some very basic Neurobiology 101. If
you don't know any neurobiology, you're going to know some in about 15
seconds. Neurons communicate with one another by spitting out
chemicals into the little gap between them. The little gap between
them is called the synapse or by the Brits, the synapse. Those
chemicals bind to the neuron on the opposite side and cause changes in
the electrical activity of that neuron on the other side of the
synapse. Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter or more specifically,
it's a neuromodulator, can change the activity of large groups of
neurons in very meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means when a person takes this drug, some of those drugs
include things like Prozac or Zoloft, the more typical names or more
generic names are things like fluoxetine, when people take those, more
serotonin hangs out in the synapse and is able to be taken up by the
neuron on the opposite side because of this selective re-uptake
inhibition. It prevents the clearance of serotonin from the synapse
and thereby more serotonin can have an effect. So SSRIs don't increase
the total amount of serotonin in the brain. They change how effective
the serotonin that's already in the brain is at changing the activity
of neurons, okay? So they don't increase serotonin, they increase the
efficacy or the function of serotonin in the way that I just
described. So that was more than 15 seconds, but now you understand
how SSRIs work. And I wouldn't be talking about SSRIs if they didn't
in fact work. Yes, there are many problems with SSRIs. They do carry
certain side effects in many individuals. Also, about a third of
people that take SSRIs don't derive any benefit, it doesn't relieve
their symptoms of depression. However, for the other two thirds,
there's often a relief of some, if not all of the symptoms of major
depression. The problem is the side effects that accompany those
SSRIs. And so these days SSRIs are a complicated topic. It's sort of
what I would call a barbed wire topic because we often hear about all
the problems with them, but these drugs also have saved a lot of
lives. They've also improved a lot of lives. The issue is that they
tend to have varying effects on different individuals, and sometimes
varying effects over time. So they'll work for awhile then they won't
work for a while. There are also a lot of mysteries about the SSRIs,
and those mysteries bother people. What mysteries am I referring to?
Well, SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin or more specifically,
they increase the efficacy of serotonin at the synapse, that happens
immediately, or very soon after people start taking SSRIs. But people
generally don't start experiencing any relief from their symptoms of
depression if they're going to experience them at all, until about two
weeks after they start taking these drugs. So there's something going
on there that's not clear. One idea is that the SSRIs actually can
improve symptoms of depression or even remove symptoms of depression
through so-called neuro-plasticity by changing the way that neural
circuits function. And there are many on this, but the main categories
of studies on SSRIs that relate to neuroplasticity fall into two
camps. One is that the ways in which SSRIs might, and I want to
emphasize, might be able to trigger the production of more neurons in
the brain, in particular areas of the hippocampus called the dentate
gyrus and others, that impact memory. This is important. We're going
to come back to memory. The other is that the SSRIs have been shown in
various scientific studies to reopen critical periods of plasticity.
I'll just briefly describe one of those studies. There was a study
done by Lamberto Maffei's group in Pisa, that explored brain
plasticity that's known to be present in young animals and disappear
in older animals. And this is also true in humans that younger humans
have a far more plastic brain that can change in many more ways more
easily than can the older brain. And what they showed was that
fluoxetine, Prozac, given to adult animals can reopen this incredible
period of plasticity, can allow more plasticity to occur. That was
interesting. I mean, it's purely through increases in serotonin
transmission. And there are other studies showing that fluoxetine can
increase the number of new neurons that are born into the adult brain,
so called neurogenesis, the production of new neurons. So it's very
clear that there are at least three major chemical systems in the
brain;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=2220"&gt;Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation &amp;amp; Craving, Serotonin/Emotions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin that relate to and can adjust
the symptoms of depression. And those actually can be divided into
separate categories. So for instance, epinephrin or norepinephrine is
thought to relate to the so-called psychomotor defects, sometimes
called psychomotor retardation. This is the lethargy, this is the
exhaustion, this is the inability to get out of bed in the morning.
Dopamine is thought to relate to the anhedonia, or I should say lack
of dopamine in depressive patients is thought to lead to the
anhedonia. The lack of ability to experience pleasure. And serotonin
is thought to relate to the grief, the guilt, some of the more
cognitive or more emotional aspects of depression. So we've got the
norepinephrine system related to activity and alertness, the dopamine
system relating to motivation, pleasure, and the ability to seek and
experience pleasure, and then the serotonin system that's related to
grief. And unfortunately, brains and organisms don't work in a simple
mathematical way where you just say, oh, well, this person's
experiencing a lot of grief, but they don't have any problems with
lethargy. And so let's just boost up their serotonin. On paper it
works, but oftentimes it doesn't work clinically. And another patient,
you might get somebody who can't experience pleasure, but they're kind
of anxious. They don't have any trouble sleeping, but they're just
much more anxious and frustrated than they normally are, and they meet
the symptoms of depression. Well, you might think, oh, well, do you
just give that person some drugs increase dopamine and everything will
be better? And indeed, in some cases that's true. There are drugs like
Wellbutrin, which function more specifically on the dopamine system to
increase dopamine and they also increase norepinephrine. Many people
get great relief from things like Wellbutrin. They don't really impact
the serotonin system so much. And therefore you don't get a lot of the
serotonergic or serotonin related side effects. However, some people
feel far too anxious on those drugs, some people get addicted to those
drugs in a way, because a lot of those drugs that increase dopamine
make you want more of those drugs. So you start to realize that what
makes sense on paper doesn't always make sense clinically. And this is
why it's complicated. And a really good psychologist and a really good
psychiatrist will work with someone to try and pull and push on these
various systems to find the combination of drugs that may be or may
not be correct for them. There's a fourth aspect of the chemistry of
depression that's really important to understand. And that's pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=2373"&gt;Physical &amp;amp; Emotional Pain are Linked: Substance P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've talked about pain on this podcast before, but even if you didn't
hear the episode on pleasure and pain, just want to emphasize that
pain is something that we experience in our body, no surprise there,
an injury, a cut, et cetera, but that we also experience emotional
pain. And those systems are linked in very intricate ways. There's
actually some data showing that pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
these sorts of things, can help certain people with emotional pain.
Now I'm not recommending people run out and take those things for
emotional pain. But actually, if you think about it, that shouldn't
come as any surprise. given the enormous number of people that take
painkillers, opioids and things like them to try and relieve their
psychological pain. And as we know, those drugs are very, very
problematic for many individuals. They can help certain individuals,
but they are very prone to abuse and they can induce addiction very
easily in a number of people. There's a substance that's literally
called substance P, the letter P, that's manufactured by neurons in
our brain and body, which underlies our sensation of pain. And indeed
substance P inhibitors have been used to treat depression, and in some
cases works. A lot of people with depression are hypersensitive to
pain, and of course they could have multiple things going on. They
could have chronic pain or chronic injury and major depression. So you
start to get the constellation of the many things that could happen.
So that's all I want to say today about the chemistry underlying
depression or major depression. There's a lot more there, but I think
if you understand the norepinephrine system and that it relates to
some of these things like lethargy, the psychomotor defects, as
they're called, dopamine and how it relates to motivation and lack of
motivation and lack of dopamine and depression, and serotonin and its
relationship to grief, and that low serotonin can lead to extreme
grief and shame and higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore a
sense of wellbeing and safety and feeling good about oneself. If you
understand that and you understand that physical pain is somehow
involved in certain cases, I think you will know more about depression
and its underlying chemistry than most all people out there. And if
you'd like to learn more, I invite you to pursue searching those terms
further on the internet. And we'll certainly go into them in more
depth. But that really sets the stage for where we're headed next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=2510"&gt;Hormones &amp;amp; Depression: Thyroid &amp;amp; Cortisol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next I'd like to talk about hormones and how they relate to
depression. And I'd also like to talk about stress and how it relates
to depression, as well as talk about some of the genetics or the
predispositions to depression. And for those of you that are thinking,
hey, I want the tools. I want to know how to fix depression. I
understand the desire for that. I will just ask if you hang in here
with me a little bit longer, not only will you learn a lot more about
how this complicated mood disorder works, some of the more interesting
things about it, but it will also position you to get a lot more out
of the tools that we will describe. You always have the option to skip
forward of course, but I think it's important to understand some of
the hormonal and stress-related aspects of depression. So let's talk
about hormones. 20% of people that have major depression have low
thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is related to metabolism. Oftentimes
we think about thyroid is only related to having a fast metabolism,
but thyroid is related to all forms of metabolism, including our
ability to synthesize new tissues like protein and repair injuries. I
did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone. If you want to
check that out, all of that is archived at hubermanlab.com. It's all
timestamped, et cetera. You can find on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, all
those places. So if you're curious about thyroid hormone and growth
hormone, and you want to do the deep dive on those, and you want to
learn how to alter their levels using various approaches, check that
out. But 20% of people with major depression are hypo thyroidal. They
don't make enough thyroid. And that leads to low energy, low
metabolism in the brain and body. And there's a condition called
Hashimoto's, which is essentially low thyroid output. And again, I
don't want to get into all the tools related to thyroid. Sometimes a
psychiatrists will prescribe thyroid medication to increase thyroid
output in people that are depressed and that will work to relieve the
symptoms. So there isn't necessarily a direct problem with serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine or substance abuse. Sometimes it's a
thyroid problem. So there are certain situations or conditions that
can impact the thyroid hormone system and make people more susceptible
to depression or make a pre-existing depression worse. And those are
things like childbirth. So it's well-known that women who give birth
can often undergo what's called postpartum depression. It actually
comes from the word post parturition depression. They give birth,
what's happier, what's more joyful than the birth of a new healthy
child, and they will lapse into a depression. And that's thought to be
hormonally related, either directly to the thyroid system or perhaps
to the cortisol system as well. We'll talk about cortisol in a moment.
As well, certain women during certain phases of their menstrual cycle
experience symptoms that are very much like clinical depression, and
oftentimes are diagnosed with clinical depression appropriately. And
of course the menstrual cycle is associated with shifts in hormone
levels. As well, menopausal and post-menopausal women are more
susceptible to major depression, regardless of whether or not they've
had that major depression earlier in their life. So these are things
to be on the lookout for and to definitely talk to a doctor and get a
blood panel that hopefully includes measures of thyroid hormone and
cortisol hormone. Why cortisol hormone? Well more stress is correlated
with more bouts of major depression across the lifespan. How many
bouts? Well, it turns out that as you go from having one to two to
three, well, when you hit four to five bouts of really intense,
stressful episodes in life, these tend to be long-term stressful
episodes, your risk for major depression goes way up. So whether or
not you have a genetic predisposition to depression or not, one of the
best things you can do to try and avoid getting depressed is to learn
to control your stress system, to not go from short-term stress, which
everybody experiences, we all have short-term stressors, to medium
term stress to long-term stress, and to not have too many bouts of
long-term stress because that probability of getting depressed goes
way, way up. And this is something I've seen over and over again, not
just in my scientific career, but just throughout life. People in all
sorts of domains, young and old, I've seen that people will go through
a very intense relationship, a breakup, sometimes it's the staying
together that stressful, sometimes it's a graduate school that can be
stressful, sometimes it's some other event. And then some months later
they become depressed. And that's because the stress system is
associated with the release of cortisol. The cortisol system can
dramatically impact the way that these different neuromodulators,
dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin function. And so there's this
kind of latent or longer lasting impact on the systems that impact
mood and wellbeing. So learning how to control your stress is really
key. If you're not depressed or you're somebody that has not lapsed
into a depression recently, take control of your stress system. And we
did an entire episode on how to conquer stress, and that involves
dealing with stress in the short term, the medium term, and in the
long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=2810"&gt;Genetic Susceptibility to Depression: Impact of Stress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are a lot of different ways to do that. One of the more
important reasons for learning how to counter stress in order to
offset depression is that there is a genetic predisposition that
certain people carry to become depressed. There are these studies now
of many, many thousands of individuals, these were mainly done in New
Zealand, but these studies have now been done elsewhere, looking at
many tens of thousands of individuals who carry particular copies of
genes, what they call polymorphisms, in particular of a gene called
5HTTLPR, which is a serotonin transporter. So this is a gene that
controls or regulates how much serotonin is available in the brain. If
you have this gene, this polymorphism, it doesn't necessarily mean
that you will be depressed, but it greatly shifts your susceptibility
to depression under conditions of stress. So I realize some people are
listening to this and some people are watching it on YouTube. So I'm
going to describe this in a way that doesn't require looking at any
graphs. What I want you to imagine is a very, shallow hill, like a
very mellow hill. It's just a ramp set at about 10 or 15 degrees,
okay. What we're plotting there in your mind is that with each about
of serious stress, so that could be trying to finish a degree or a
relationship breakup, or a family member that's sick, or the loss of a
loved one or a pet, with each about of stress, the probability that
you will experience a major depression goes up. However, if you carry
this gene, this HTTLPR gene, the steepness of that curve goes way, way
up where it's actually more like a line such that you need far fewer
bouts of stress in order to lapse into a major depression, okay? So if
the typical person who doesn't carry this polymorphism has to
experience two or three or four or five bouts of stress before they
lapse into a depression, somebody with this gene is susceptible to
getting depression after just one about or two bouts of intense
stress, okay? So that's how these genes work. They don't preordain or
determine you to be depressed. They raise a susceptibility. And many
genes, many things related to heritability in general, work in that
way. And we know there's a strong genetic component to depression. How
do we know? Well, in what are called concordant monozygotic twins. So
these will be identical twins. And they can either be in one
biological sack or two biological sacks while in utero, what's called
monochorionic or dichorionic. Well, typically it's monochorionic. And
identical twins, for which one of those twins goes on to have major
depression, there's a 50% probability that the other one will have
major depression. So it's not 100%, it's not 100% inherited, it's not
100% generic, as you might say, but there's a much higher
predisposition for depression. Whereas in fraternal twins, that number
drops, and in siblings, that number drops to about 25%, and in half
siblings, it's about 10%. The numbers vary from study to study, but
basically the more closely related you are to somebody who has major
depression, the more likely it is that you will also get major
depression. And therefore, if you haven't gotten major depression, the
more likely it is that you should take steps to learn to mitigate
stress because stress is the major factor that can trigger one of
these depressive episodes. So we've covered a lot related to the
stress and the hormones and the neurochemistry of depression. In fact,
I think this is probably the deepest I've ever gone into the biology
of any topic on this podcast before getting to any specific tools. I
mentioned that learning how to mitigate stress and deal with stress,
learning how to measure and adjust your thyroid hormone, those might
be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=3050"&gt;Understanding Biological Mechanism Is Key: Recipes versus Skills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But next I'd like to turn to some very specific tools that people who
both have depression or who are prone to depression, as well as people
who don't have depression and simply want to maintain a good mood, who
want to maintain a positive affect and pursuit of things in life, what
are the things that you can do? It turns out there are things that you
can do and all of the biology that underlies the utility of those
things. Meaning the reasons those things work will now make sense to
you because they adjust things like serotonin and dopamine, and they
adjust them through very specific pathways. I know for many people
learning about mechanism is kind of grueling. I realized this podcast
isn't necessarily one that you can listen to passively while doing
other things. Although I would hope that you could do that and still
enjoy it and extract the information. Why mechanism? Mechanism is so
key because mechanism is a little bit like understanding some of the
chemistry of cooking. If you read a recipe and you can follow a
recipe, you often hear people say, oh, I can follow a recipe. That
means that if you have every ingredient in that recipe, you're good.
You likely can make that dish. You can make that meal. However, if you
understand a little bit of the chemistry of why salt has to be added
third and not first, or why the heat has to be adjusted at a
particular time, well then not only can you follow a recipe, but that
also gives you flexibility for when salt isn't available, or when you
want to adjust the flavor of the dish, or when you want to try a new
dish, or you want to get experimental. So when you understand
mechanism, it puts you in a tremendous place of power to work with
your system. So it's not just plug and chug, like take 12 milligrams
of this, you either feel better or you don't. You can really start to
understand how prescription drugs, supplements, nutrition, behavioral
tools, how those things weave together to either work for you or not
work for you and get you to paths of healthy mind and body. So let's
think about why any tool would work to relieve depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=3170"&gt;Tools for Dealing with Depression: Logic &amp;amp; Implementation (Protocol 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've talked about how some of the drugs that impact these different
chemical systems might work and why they create some of the problems
they create. Problems are mainly created by the fact that they impact
lots of systems in the brain and body. So you take a drug to increase
serotonin, but that serotonin is also related, not just to mood, but
to things related to libido and appetite. And so you start disrupting
multiple systems. The same could be said for behavioral tools, right?
That any behavioral tool that adjusts the levels of a particular
chemical ought to perhaps, provide some relief for some of the
symptoms of major depression. Let's take an example that I've talked
about before on the podcast, which is, if you get into a very cold
shower, you take an ice bath, you will release norepinephrine and
epinephrine in your brain and body. There's no question about that. I
don't think anyone can really escape that. It's a kind of a universal
response to being in cold water. Well, if some aspects of depression
are related to low levels of norepinephrine, will taking cold showers
relieve your depression? Perhaps it might even relieve certain aspects
of that depression. Is it a cure? Well, that's going to depend on the
individual. Will exercise help? Well, if you go out for a run, you're
going to increase the amount of norepinephrine in your body. If you
enjoy that run, it's likely that you'll increase the levels of
dopamine and probably serotonin in your brain and body as well. Will
that cure your depression? Well, there are a lot of studies exploring
how exercise can impact depression. And indeed, regular exercise is
known to be a protective behavior against depression, but it also can
help relieve some of the symptoms of depression. So you may ask
yourself, why would you need drugs at all? Why would there be
prescription drugs or the need for supplementation or other things to
alleviate the symptoms of depression? Ah, well, that's the diabolical
nature of depression, which is if people are far enough along in this
thing, this sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder, but
major depression, oftentimes they can't get the energy to even get up
and take a bath or a shower. They have no motivation to do it, they
have no desire to go for a run. So you say, "Come on, let's go, you'll
feel better. "I know you feel better, it generates all these chemicals
"I heard on the whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast that getting into action "does all these things." And they
just don't want to do it. And to you, a person who's not experiencing
depression, that perhaps could just seem like the most frustrating and
confusing thing in the world. But it's very important to highlight the
fact that these circuits that are accessible to some of us, the
circuits for happiness, for pursuit of pleasure, for exercise, for
getting in a cold shower, if that's your thing, that those circuits
are present in all people, but for certain people that are
experiencing major depression and are really in the depths of their
depression, they can't really access those circuits in the same way
that people who are not suffering from depression can. So I hope that
makes it clear. It's not offering any excuses for them. And indeed, I
think those behaviors would help jolt them out of some of the
symptomology of depression, but they're just not accessible to
everybody. So let's talk about the things that people can do to deal
with depression. And again, anytime you add a behavior or a tool or a
supplement, or subtract a behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
you absolutely should talk to your physician, especially if you're
somebody that's dealing with major depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=3385"&gt;Brain Inflammation &amp;amp; Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to focus on the stress system. And I'm not just going to tell
you to get sunlight in your eyes and to get a good night's sleep,
although I think everybody should do that on a regular basis, ideally
every day, talked about those ad nauseum on this podcast. They will
help your sleep, they will help you alleviate stress. I think you
should have tools to deal with stress in real time, et cetera. But
let's look at depression from the standpoint of a deeper biological
phenomenon, which is inflammation and the immune system. There's
growing evidence now that many forms of major depression, if not all
of them, relate to excessive inflammation. Now inflammation plays an
important role in wound healing. It is a positive aspect of our immune
system. Our ability to combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera, but
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation that lasts too long, or is
of too high amplitude, meaning too many anti-inflammatory or
inflammatory cytokines and things of that sort in the body is bad. And
there's decent evidence now that inflammation can lead to or
exacerbate depression. And that if we want to control depression, or
limit or eliminate depression, that focusing on reducing inflammation
and its associated pathways is a really good thing to do. And I think
this is a really good thing for everybody to do regardless of whether
or not you suffer from depression or not. And today we're going to
talk about exactly how depression comes about through the inflammation
pathway. So, first of all, who are the major players in creating
chronic inflammation in the brain and body? They are the inflammatory
cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6, things like Tumor Necrosis
Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not all of
these are cytokines. You have interferons and prostoglandins and a lot
of these things. But when we are stressed, chronically stressed, we
get inflamed, our brain and various locations of the brain become
inflamed because certain classes of cells, in particular, those glial
cells, the cells that are typically thought to just be support cells,
those cells and their biochemistry and their dialogue with the neurons
of the brain and body starts to become disrupted. I may have mentioned
it earlier, I don't recall. But I certainly mentioned it in an earlier
podcast that adrenaline epinephrin, when it's released in the body, it
doesn't cross the blood brain barrier, but there are certain things
that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier when we are stressed.
Things like the E2 prostoglandins, those cross the blood brain
barrier. And our blood and our brain, therefore our brain and our body
can communicate because certain things can pass through this barrier
we call the BBB or the Blood Brain Barrier. And also we have something
called the glymphatic system, which is really a plumbing system that
links the brain and body. It's the link between the immune system and
the brain. Well, there is a set of actions that we can take in order
to limit inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=3560"&gt;Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this has been shown in several quality peer reviewed studies now
to reduce inflammation and to relieve some, and in some cases, all of
the symptoms of major depression. One of those approaches is to
increase our intake of so-called EPAs or Essential Fatty Acids.
There's now a very long list of papers in quality peer review journals
showing that when people ingest a certain level of EPA omega-3 fatty
acids, the relief from depressive symptoms matches the SSRIs. That's
incredible, right? That essential fatty acids could relieve symptoms
of depression, as well as some of the prescription antidepressants.
Now, this doesn't necessarily mean you run off and stop taking your
antidepressants if you've been prescribed them, please don't do that.
Please talk to your physician. And I should mention that some of the
same studies have shown that increasing our intake of these essential
fatty acids, in particular, the EPA variety of omega-3s, can lower the
effective dose of things like SSRIs. Meaning if we required a 50
milligram or 40 milligram dose of fluoxetine, that one can get by on a
lower dose and thereby perhaps not experience as many or as severe
side effects by taking or supplementing with EPAs. Now, the threshold
level seems to be about one gram, 1000 milligrams of EPA. So you will
sometimes see on a bottle of krill oil or fish oil or any other
source, even plant source or other source of EPA that it's 1000
milligrams or 1200 milligrams. But what's really important to look at
is whether or not there's more than 1000 milligrams of EPA, because
the EPA in particular is what's important here. And actually in
exploring some of the literature on the effects of EPAs on
cardiovascular health, excuse me, as well as their effects on
depression, there's some interesting dose dependent responses, such
that people who took anywhere from 400 milligrams to 5,000 milligrams
of EPAs, achieved a variety of different benefits. And in some cases,
some side effects, we'll talk about those. And it does seem that this
1000 milligrams is the critical threshold for benefiting or getting
some relief from depressive symptoms. But people who took two grams
seem to do better. And in the cardiovascular health realm, there it's
a little more complicated. Some studies point to a very positive
effect on cardiovascular health by taking increasing amounts of EPA,
others, not so much. The current data point to the fact that for every
gram of EPA that one ingest, there's about a 9% improvement in
cardiovascular health, the same dose dependent improvement on
psychological health in combating depression can't really be stated. I
wouldn't say that the more EPA you take, the better you're going to
feel so to speak. I don't think the data point to that. However, it
does seem that if you take a gram, 1000 milligrams or 2000 milligrams
of EPA, there does seem to be some substantial relief for many people,
should emphasize many, not all, for many people in major depressive
symptoms. So how would this work? Well, turns out that these
inflammatory cytokines,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=3770"&gt;How EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine, Quinolinic Acid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they impact neurons and the circuits of the brain that relate to
things like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. These
inflammatory cytokines act in a variety of different ways, but they
mainly act to inhibit the release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and
dopamine, or the synthesis of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine.
And I'll give you one example of how EPAs can positively impact this
process. And then it points to a second tool, which is the proper
utilization of exercise to offset the effects of depression. So now
you should understand why having healthy levels of serotonin is
important for maintaining healthy mood. It's not responsible for all
the aspects of having a healthy mood, there's also dopamine and
norepinephrine, but it is a very important one. Dopamine also called
5HT, essentially derives from a precursor called tryptophan.
Tryptophan arrives into our system through our diet, okay, tryptophan
is an amino acid. Tryptophan is found in Turkey, it's found in
carbohydrates. And that should therefore raise the idea, hmm, I wonder
if one of the reasons why people who are depressed have such an
appetite for carbohydrate late in foods is because they're trying to
get more tryptophan, and therefore more serotonin. And indeed that's
the case. Tryptophan is eventually converted into serotonin. However,
if there's excessive amounts of inflammation, these inflammatory
cytokines cause tryptophan to not be converted so much into serotonin,
but to be diverted down a different pathway. The pathway involves
something called IDO, Indoleamine, which converts tryptophan into
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts as a neurotoxin by way of
converting into something called quinolinic acid. And quinolinic acid
is pro depressive. So if that seems like a complicated biochemical
pathway, what's basically happening here is that the tryptophan that
normally would be made into serotonin, under conditions of
inflammation is being diverted into a neurotoxic pathway. And
ingestion of EPAs, because it limits these inflammatory cytokines,
things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause more of the
tryptophan that one ingests or has in their body to be diverted
towards the serotoninergic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=3925"&gt;Protocol 4: How Exercise Offsets Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise, it turns out, also has a positive effect on the tryptophan
to serotonin conversion pathway. And the way it does it is really
interesting. You now know that tryptophan can either be converted into
serotonin or it can be converted into this neurotoxin, which is a bad
thing. Exercise, the activation of the muscles through rhythmic
repeated use, in particular aerobic exercise, but also resistance
training has been shown to do this to some extent, tends to sequester
or shuttle the contouring into the muscle so that it isn't converted
into this neurotoxin that is pro depression, okay? There are a lot of
steps in the pathway leading to depression, but what this essentially
means is that hitting a certain threshold level of EPA intake, whether
by supplementation with fish oil or krill oil or through some plant
source if you're not into ingesting fish or krill, or trying to get up
above that 1000 milligram threshold for EPA by ingesting particular
food sources, you certainly can do it through food, you don't have to
supplement, but it's easier to do with supplements, that doing that
will limit the inflammation that diverts tryptophan into this
neurotoxic pathway. And exercise as well, augments this conversion of
tryptophan into serotonin because it takes this thing that would
potentially be a neurotoxin and it sequesters it, it pulls it away so
that it can't actually go have its pro depressive effects. So you've
got multiple steps here. We're describing two tools, increasing EPA
and regular exercise as a way of increasing serotonin, somewhat
indirectly, right? It's by limiting this bad pathway to promote the
activity of a good pathway. But from the data that are published in
Quality Peer Review journals, it really appears that this inflammation
pathway does function to increase depression through these pathways.
And so knowing that there are behavioral steps and supplementation
based steps, or if you prefer getting your EPAs from typical food,
from nutritional approaches, I find that very reassuring that the
mechanisms all converge on a common pathway, serotonin. That gives me
great peace of mind that when people say, hey, go out for a run, or
you should get outdoors exercise, or you should take fish oil like the
Scandinavians do, I have Scandinavian family members and they are
known to, or I should say they are quite open about the fact that
during the winter months in particular when depression is more likely,
but throughout the year, really, they make an effort to regularly
ingest high levels of EPA, either through ingesting fatty fish and its
skin, I'm not a particular fan of ingesting the skin of fatty fish, or
by supplementing with Cod liver oil or other types of fish oil,
sardines, and things of that sort, sardine oils. There are a number of
different things out there that one could use. So I find it very
reassuring that there's a common biochemical pathway that can explain
why these things not just work, but why they should work. They should
work because they operate in the very same biochemical pathways that
antidepressants that are prescribed to people do. So what does this
mean for you? Well, if you're somebody who suffers from major
depression, again, don't stop taking your prescribed medication. Talk
to your doctor, but talk to them perhaps about the EPAs and exercise
and how these things can impinge on the same biochemical pathways. If
you're somebody who is not suffering from major depression, I still
think these pathways are really important to understand. And actually
knowing these pathways is additional motivation to get regular
exercise. I think we all know that we should be getting anywhere from
150 minutes to 180 minutes per week of so-called zone two cardio for
cardiovascular effects. Zone two is the kind of melowish cardio where
you can sort of hold a conversation if you needed to. But it's a
little bit tough, you're kind of sucking for air a little bit. And
that's going to limit these depressive like symptoms, I think in all
of us. I don't think that we should think of depression as a strict
threshold. I'm somebody who personally has made the choice to take
1000 milligrams of EPA per day. I do that by supplementing fish oil.
There's debate out there as to whether or not it's better to take EPA
NDHA in particular ratios, and whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,
which is the so-called bad cholesterol. That's getting really down
into the weeds. And we can talk about that in a future episode. But
for myself, I notice a pretty substantial positive effect of taking
anywhere from 1000 milligrams to 2000 milligrams of EPA per day. I do
that through supplementation and I do strive to try and eat some fish,
even though frankly, I've never liked the taste of fish. For those of
you that would like a little more detail or perhaps a lot more detail
into the effects of EPA on depression and in relieving depressive
symptoms, and if you want to get into the nitty gritty of it, I invite
you to go to examine.com, put in depression, EPA, they list off and
have links to 28 studies on the effects of EPA on major depression. If
you go to pub med, there are many, many studies on this now that date
back several decades, really. If you're interested in the specific
effects of EPA, as opposed to DHA, I want to point you towards a
particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, but not DHA appears
to be responsible for the efficacy of omega-3 long chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation and depression, evidence
from a meta analysis of randomized control trials. This is a really
wonderful paper. The author is Julian Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S. It was
published in 2009. We will provide a link to this study in the
caption. And that study is really the one that at least to me, points
to why EPA in particular is what's effective, and that whether or not
DHA is problematic or not as a separate issue, but it's really the EPA
that one wants to hit a certain threshold level of if one's goal is to
get relief from depression or to keep depression at bay by keeping
mood elevated, which is why I take a high-dose EPA. So we've got EPA,
we got exercise, now you understand how they work to adjust mood. Now,
I want to talk about something that at least for me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=4304"&gt;Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function &amp;amp; NMDA receptors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;was quite surprising when I first learned about it for sake of
treatment of mood disorders, and that's creatine. Creatine has a
number of very important functions throughout the body. For those of
you that are into resistance training, and actually for those of you
that are into endurance training as well, creatine has achieved a lot
of popularity in recent years because supplementation with creatine
can draw more water into muscles and can increase power output from
muscles. So it's something that does indeed work. There have been
debates about whether or not it's unhealthy for the kidneys to take
long-term creatine, supplementation at high doses. And I invite you to
go down that rabbit hole. I think most people now accept the idea that
for most people, not all, but for most people, low dose creatine
supplementation of anywhere from one gram to five grams per day can
have a number of positive effects on physical performance. People with
kidney issues, et cetera, need to be especially cautious, but creatine
is interesting for that purpose. However, there's also a so-called
phosphocreatine system in the brain, and that phosphocreatine system
has everything to do with the dialogue between neurons and these other
cell types called, glial, and glial comprise several cell types,
microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, but the foster creatine system in
the forebrain in particular, in the front of our brain, has been shown
to be involved in regulation of mood and some of the reward pathways
as well as in depression. And there are now several studies, at least
three, although they're probably more by the time this comes out
because they're coming out very quickly now, at least three quality
studies pointing to the fact that creatine supplementation doesn't
just have these positive effects on physical performance, but can also
be used as a way to increase mood and to improve the symptoms of major
depression. This has been now done in several double blind placebo
controlled studies. The studies have looked at women, have it looked
at men, have looked at adolescents, some of whom were taking SSRIs,
some of whom were not, they've done magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
So spectroscopy is a way that you can look at the concentrations of
particular in the brain in real time in humans, it can be used for
other things as well, of course. And basically what's been observed is
that increasing the activity of the phosphocreatine system in the
forebrain can be beneficial or at least is correlated with
improvements in mood. So let's just talk for a moment about what's
involved with using or supplementing creatine in order to improve mood
and perhaps even treat depression. First of all, when I talk about
creatine, I'm talking about creatine monohydrate, there are a number
of different forms of creatine. Here I'm talking about creatine
monohydrate. The American Journal of Psychiatry in 2012, published a
study, which was a randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial
of oral creatine monohydrate. And what it found is that it could
augment or enhance the response to a selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor, in particular, in women with major depressive disorder. So
like EPA, creatine supplementation seems to either lower the required
dose of SSRI that's required to treat depression, or can improve the
effectiveness of a given dose of SSRI. However, there are other
studies that have looked directly at creating supplementation in the
absence of SSRIs. And those are interesting as well. There's a
wonderful and very comprehensive review on creatine for the treatment
of major depression that includes beautiful tables of all the subjects
and the dosages, et cetera. I'm not going to read off every line and
every column in that review, but we will provide a link to that review
as well. One of the things that's really striking about the lists of
studies that they include is that most of them used dosages that are
pretty reasonable for most people, anywhere from three grams to five
grams, sometimes up to as many 10 grams per day of creatine. Many of
these also were shown to increase activity of this phosphocreatine
system in the forebrain, and some show a relationship between that
phosphocreatine system and a particular category of receptors in the
brain called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. The
NMDA receptor is one of the first things that every budding
neuroscientists learns about because it is the receptor that has
particular electrical and chemical properties that make it a critical
gate for so-called neuroplasticity. So it's not a receptor that's
activated in the brain, typically for just the functioning of the
brain on a day-to-day basis. It's a receptor that's activated when
circuits are going to change, when they are inspired to change by some
very strong stimulus, meaning some experience, or in some cases a
drug, or in some cases something else. But the NMDA receptor is a kind
of a key node for shifting brain circuitry. And so while the details
aren't entirely clear, it seems that creatine supplementation leads to
increases in the phosphocreatine system in the forebrain. And that
increases in the activity of the forebrain phosphocreatine system
relate to changes in the way the NMDA receptors function and may lead
to some of the plasticity, the changes in neural circuits that
underlie the shift from negative mood and affect to positive mood.
Now, there are a lot of gaps. There are a lot of little boxes or bins
in the diagram I just laid out for you. And some of them are still
truly black boxes, as we say, meaning, we don't really know what's in
them yet. And more mechanistic data are coming. However, when you look
over the data in this review, or when I look over the data in this
review, what you find is that they're pretty striking positive effects
of creatine. And one of the more interesting effects is that creatine
has actually been shown to increase mania in people that are already
manic. And that's interesting, we're not talking about bipolar
depression today, but it seems that creatine elevates levels of
activation and kind of mood overall. And you could see why that would
be a problem for somebody that's already in a manic phase, but it
actually might be beneficial for somebody who is very low affect and
has major depression. So should you supplement with creatine? Well, as
always, talk to your healthcare provider, but if you're somebody who
is thinking about things that you can do and things that you can take
in order to improve your mood, keep depression at bay, maybe even
support other treatments for major depression. the creatine system
seems like a logical one. There's at least strong studies and a good
number of them to look to, to determine whether or not that's right
for you. I personally take five grams of creatine for other reasons. I
take it for the physical performance, enhancing effects, but it's kind
of nice to think that perhaps it's also helping me improve my mood.
That's a choice that I've made for me is in within the margins of
safety for me in my life. I don't know that it's right for everybody,
but I find it very interesting. And again, I find it particularly
interesting because there's a logical biochemical pathway to support
the finding that it improves mood and can offset the effects of major
depression in some cases, or can improve the effects of antidepressant
medication in many cases. When I see mechanism and I see
effectiveness, and the mechanism and the effectiveness map to a lot of
the same mechanisms that are involved in prescription drugs, that
gives me great reassurance that this isn't just some sort of
mysterious pathway or mysterious compound by which a creatine might be
working. So now we've kind of clustered together EPAs, exercise, and
their relationship to inflammation, creatine and its relationship to
forebrain function, and the phosphocreatine system, and this NMDA
receptor. And as you'll see in a few minutes, that NMDA receptor turns
out to be vitally important and is actually one of the main nodes of
action for some of the more novel and exciting therapeutics that are
being explored now in psychiatric clinics. So let's talk a little bit
more about this NMDA receptor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=4830"&gt;Protocol 6&lt;em&gt;: Ketamine, PCP (&lt;/em&gt;Prescription-Only), &amp;amp; NMDA-Receptor Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and how it relates to some of the more experimental or novel
therapeutic compounds for the treatment of major depression. And the
compounds that we're going to be talking about, you may have heard of
before, one is ketamine, which is getting increasing interest in
psychiatric clinics and in various experimental and clinical studies,
and the other is PCP. Both ketamine and PCP are known drugs of abuse.
For many years, people have abused these drugs, go by the street name,
special K, et cetera. And they create dissociative anesthetic states.
So dissociative states where people don't feel as closely meshed with
their emotions and their perceptions. It's an odd state, I hear. And
it's an odd state that clinicians are now leveraging for the treatment
of depression. And we'll talk about why that is, but let's talk a
little bit about this NMDA receptor and why ketamine and PCP might
work for the treatment of depression or how they even could work. I
want to be very direct that this is an area that still needs a lot of
data. There are however, some excellent papers from really terrific
groups. One of them is a paper that was published in nature last year,
2020. First author is Vesuna, Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A, and the last
author and the lead on the study, who was Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who was
a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast a few months ago. He's world
expert in neuroscience, he's a psychiatrist. And this paper from Sam
Vesuna and Karl and colleagues explored how these dissociative states
come about. And they looked at this both in animals and in humans and
found that there was a, essentially a common mechanism whereby a
particular layer of cortex, so your brain has this outer shell of
tissue that is called the neocortex. It's where our perceptions lie,
it's where our associations lie, it's a very important area for
processing decision-making and planning, et cetera. It's literally
stacks of cells, and one of those layers in the stack of cells is
layer five. And the layer five neurons in particular, went into a
particular rhythm of electrical activity, this one to three Hertz
rhythm after mice or humans were administered ketamine or PCP. There
was activation of a particular area of the brain, this retro splenium
cortex as it's called. And the dissociative state that emerged was an
interesting one. And clinically what's described in the trials for
ketamine and things like it, that people who are depressed will take
ketamine, will experience a kind of separateness from their grief and
from their emotions. And that possibly there's plasticity, there
actually shifts in the neural circuitry, such that their emotions
don't weigh on them so heavily, I'm using very loose language here,
but that they don't feel as over written or as burdened by their own
emotions as they did previously to the ketamine therapy. Now,
absolutely in no way, shape or form am I suggesting that people run
out and take ketamine in order to treat their own depression. These
drugs are still very much experimental, although they are approved in
certain contexts, at least in the U S, by prescription for the
treatment of depression. What's interesting to me is that these
dissociative states sound at least at the outset to be more of a
separateness from everything. It sounds a little bit like depression
itself. That's sort of like anhedonia and an inability to experience
pleasure. And then one takes a dissociative anesthetic and somehow is
able to get relief by getting even further away from an experience. To
me, that doesn't make sense, but that just speaks to the fact that
these drugs and these receptors and these pathways operate through
very cryptic means. And we really don't understand all the pathways in
the brain that relate to motivation and mood and so forth. And the
results with these ketamine trials are looking very promising. In
fact, there are a number of trials that show that a fair number of
people that take ketamine in a therapeutic setting legally with a
psychiatrist guiding the experience are able to get relief from their
symptoms without the need for many, many treatments with the drug.
Just how many treatments varies from individual to individual, but
it's not like people have to take this stuff ongoing. This is really
an attempt to tap into this NMDA receptor that is related to
neuroplasticity. Both ketamine and PCP essentially act as antagonists,
which means they block the NMDA receptor. They do it through different
methods, non-competitive and competitive for you chemists and
pharmacologists out there. You can look it up if you like. But what's
therefore even more surprising is that every neuroscientist learns
that activation of the NMDA receptor, not antagonism or blocking of
the NMDA receptor leads to changes in neural circuitry in very
profound ways. In fact experimentally, and I've done these experiments
myself, if you want to prevent plasticity, you want to prevent an
experience from reshaping neural circuitry, you give an MDA receptor
blocker. I've done that many times in the course of my experimental
neuroscience career, not to myself, obviously, but in the course of
doing experiments. So it's still a bit mysterious to me how this could
work. A couple things. One is this layer five activation is pretty
interesting. We're going to come back to layer five when we talk about
yet another emerging treatment for depression, which has psilocybin,
so-called magic mushrooms, and the effects of psilocybin on layer five
neurons in the cortex. So there's a common theme emerging here, which
is that layer five activity in the cortex may be important for
rewiring the brain in certain ways that can lead to recovery or to an
alleviation of some of the symptoms of major depression. So if this is
sounding a little bit vague to you, it's because this is still truly
experimental and new, and still very much on the cutting edge of
what's happening now. We don't have all the answers. So if it sounds
like I'm moving slowly through this, and I'm being extra careful about
what I say, you are correct. Your antenna are correct in this case. I
never want to misstep and say something that's not true, but that's
especially the case when we're talking about experimental therapies
and drugs, which formerly were taken as drugs of abuse, which are now
being used as drugs for therapeutic treatment in the clinic. There is
a very interesting study. This was published in science in 2019. So
these are very recent studies. The last author on this is Liston, L-I-
S-T-O-N. The title of the paper is "Sustained Rescue of Prefrontal
Circuit Dysfunction "by Antidepressant Induced Spine Formation." And
here, when we hear spine, we're not referring to spine as in your
vertebrae, running down your spinal column, we're talking about the
spines, which are these little protrusions on neurons. Neurons are not
smooth by any stretch. If you zoom in on a neuron, if you were to come
to my lab and look down the microscope at a neuron and zoom in on it,
you'd find that some neurons are smooth, but most neurons have these
little protrusions. And those little protrusions are called spines.
And those little spiny protrusions are little sites where neurons can
reach out and form and receive new synapses from neighboring neurons.
So they increase the surface area of a neuron and allow new
connections to be formed. And so spine formation is synonymous with
neuroplasticity, which is synonymous with changes in circuit function,
which is synonymous with changes in the ways that we think, we feel,
and we behave. And what was shown in the study is really interesting.
What they showed is that ketamine can relieve depressive symptoms
rapidly by changing or increasing in this case, the spines on these
neurons in the prefrontal cortex. And if that word prefrontal rings a
bell, well, now you remember the phosphocreatine system, the ingestion
of creatine monohydrate, and the forebrain, activation of the
forebrain were related to, in some way or another, to relief or
improvement of major depressive symptoms. So we're starting to
converge on a picture here whereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP, used in
a therapeutic context, may be increasing neuroplasticity. Literally
the changing of neurocircuits in the forebrain somehow through
dissociative states. And I don't want to speculate too much about how
that might come about, but one of the things that's such a resounding
or repeating theme of major depression is that when you talk to
somebody who has major depression, it is a real downer. And I'm not
being disparaging of those people. But if you've ever had a
conversation with someone who's depressed, they're always talking
about how exhausted they are, or in really severe cases, they are not
even responsive at all. They just kind of stare at you blankly, or
they fall asleep. I mean, they're truly depressed. Their system is
lowered in terms of its activation state. So I think that it's
interesting that the application of drugs that allow people to
separate from that state of not caring or being uninterested or
unwilling to do anything is actually one of the paths to treatment.
It's not always about just getting people peppy and excited and happy.
There also seems to be requirement for getting them distanced from
their own grief. And this brings us back to something that we talked
about way back at the beginning of this episode, which was this
particular feature of the anti self confabulation, that everything
that happens is a reflection that I should say for the depressed
person, that everything that happens is a reflection of how life is
bad and their experiences just point to the fact that nothing is going
to get better. This is the common language of depression. If this is
very depressing to hear me talk about it, it is heavy. And that's what
it's like to hear these things, it's even heavier, of course, for
somebody to experience them. And those beliefs, those patterns of
guilt and grief and anhedonia and delusional anti self confabulation,
those are the things that eventually, if they get severe enough, start
to convert into things like self harm mutilation, and in the most
tragic of cases, of course, suicide. And so I think we can look to
these treatments such as ketamine and PCP, but in particular ketamine
and its use in the clinic, as ways for people to get distanced from
the negative affect that they feel isn't just inside them or
overwhelms them, but that for the very severely depressed person, they
feel is them. And we hear this sometimes, you are not your emotions.
That's a statement that I've always been a little bit challenged by. I
mean, yes, indeed emotions are not who we are. They are states that we
go into and out of, including happiness and sadness, but they are very
much a part of us when we experience them. We don't experience them as
next to us or behind us or across the room from us. We experienced
them as our emotions. They are so much part and parcel with our
experience of ourself that a statement like we aren't our emotions is
a very hard statement to digest, especially for the depressed person.
And so I think that the NMDA receptor and its capacity to induce
neuroplasticity, circuit changes, the fact that PCP and ketamine are
both showing activation of neural circuits by way of suppressing
activity of the NMDA receptor, and some of the positive or exciting
therapeutic outcomes that are coming from this really point to the
fact that ketamine and PCP and removal of negative experiences or the
experience of a negative experience, sort of getting meta there. But
the experience of a negative experience may be an important path by
which people treat their depression, especially in its most severe
forms where people are veering towards self-harm, mutilation, and
suicide. So you may have noticed a theme,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=5588"&gt;Protocol 7&lt;em&gt;: Psychedelics (&lt;/em&gt;In Clinical Trials) for Major Depression: Psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is that certain categories of approaches that we've been
discussing for offsetting the symptoms of depression, such as
exercise, ingesting EPAs, reducing inflammation, or even the SSRIs for
increasing serotonin, focus on changing some core biological function,
like raising the amount of a chemical, serotonin, or reducing the
amount of inflammatory cytokines in the brain and body. And yet things
like ketamine focus more on rewiring circuitry, changing neural
circuitry so that it functions better in the immediate and hopefully
in the long-term as well, and keep people with major depression in
what they call, remission, away from major depression. Another
category of treatments that's being actively explored now in
laboratories and in the psychiatry realm are the psychedelics. And
that's a huge category of compounds. However, one in particular,
psilocybin is one that's being most intensely and actively pursued for
its capacity to treat major depressive disorder. I want to be very
clear that the work that I'm going to describe as work that's being
done in university settings, university hospitals, by scientists and
psychiatrists, and these are clinical studies, clinical trials,
leading to peer reviewed data. And those are the data that we'll be
discussing. Some of the major luminaries in this area include, of
course aren't limited to, but include people like Matthew Johnson
who's at Johns Hopkins. We'll discuss some of his work now, and
fortunate to say that he will be coming on the podcast as a guest to
just scribe the studies in a variety of laboratories, working on a
variety of different psychedelic compounds, but let's focus on
psilocybin for its capacity to rewire neural circuits and alleviate
depression. There have been anecdotal data or evidence over the years
that psilocybin has this capacity, how does psilocybin work? Well,
psilocybin, magic mushrooms, as it's sometimes called, mainly works on
what's called the serotonin 5H2A receptor with some affinity for the
5HT1 receptor. What does that mean? Well, basically, you've got a lot
of different kinds of serotonin receptors just as you have a lot of
different kinds of dopamine receptors or other types of receptors. The
advantage of having different receptors expressed in different parts
of the brain and body, even on different parts of individual cells in
the brain and body is that the same compound, serotonin, can have a
diverse set of effects on different cells and tissues. This is also
the basis of some of the side effect profiles of SSRIs, because maybe
for instance, we know that taking Prozac fluoxetine will increase
serotonin in one area, but also in another area. And then they will go
have diverse effects on different brain circuits because of the
variety of receptors. Receptors are just like parking slots where the
molecule serotonin parks and has different effects. Well psilocybin
engages or increases serotonin transmission, meaning it increases the
amount of serotonin, mainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors, but
where in the brain does it happen and what are the major effects?
First, let's talk about the major effects 'cause I think that's what
people are interested in. The study that I'd like to highlight is a
fairly recent one. It was published in may of 2021 in Journal of the
American Medical Association Psychiatry, so JAMA Psychiatry, and it's
entitled, "Effects of Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive
Disorder, a Randomized Clinical Trial." It's an absolutely beautiful
study, a very important study. It includes some of the luminaries in
this area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, and
others. We will provide a link to this study. It is available in its
full form at zero cost if you want to read it. It's got a lot of
detail. So I'm just going to summarize a few things, but basically
what they did was they screened for patients to come into the clinic.
These were people that suffered from major depressive disorder, and
administered either one or two rounds of psilocybin. They used
particular dosages that are listed in the study. So you can look it up
if you're really interested in that level of detail. Typically it was
20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. So it depends on body
weight. Or 30 milligrams of psilocybin per 70 kilograms of body
weight. They were given in capsule form. So people weren't eating the
mushrooms. This is obviously a very controlled study and they wanted
to control the dosages appropriately. They were randomized to begin
the treatment immediately or after an eight week delay. They had all
the appropriate control groups that one would like to see. What's
really striking this study is that there was a very significant
improvement in mood and affect and relief from depressive symptoms in
anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people that were subjects in the study
who received the psilocybin treatment. And whether or not it was 50 or
whether or not it was 71%, varied according to how long after the
study they maintain these antidepressive effects, whether or not they
stayed in remission from the depression, but these are really enormous
insignificant effects, and very exciting and are pointing in the
direction of psilocybin very soon, becoming a treatment for various
forms of depression, including major depression. Now, of course, this
is limited to the laboratory at present. There are a number of
elements of these studies that are important to take into
consideration too, which is that there are highly trained guides,
meaning people to direct people through the experience. As Matthew
Johnson has told me, there is the occurrence from time to time of
people having so-called bad trips of having anxiety attacks during the
hallucinations and all that. And they have ways to mitigate that and
deal with that because the guides are trained. They have all the sorts
of medical monitoring devices for heart rate and temperature and
things that one would like to see for a study like this, because these
are very powerful compounds. I don't want to give away any elements of
the discussion with Matthew Johnson, because it will be released in
podcast form reasonably soon here, the Huberman Lab podcast. But one
of the things that came up and is a fundamental question that I had,
that I think probably many of you are asking, is does the experience
that one has on these compounds make a difference for whether or not
somebody gains relief from depression, from these psilocybin journeys
or not? In other words, does it matter what they talk about? Does it
matter what they think about? Does it matter if they have a good trip
or a bad trip? And I don't want to hold you in too much suspense, I'll
let Matthew provide the more thorough answer. But what's really
interesting is there are some common themes to psilocybin
administration and experience that lead to relief from depressive
symptoms, but they are subjectively very varied, meaning that whether
or not people feel they had a good experience or a bad experience,
whether or not people thought about their parents or thought about the
color of the ceiling, doesn't seem to have too much of an impact on
whether or not they receive relief during these studies in these
clinical studies. It seems like different people can have lots of
different experiences and still receive benefit. And that points to
something deeper. It points to the fact that these drugs, which is
really what they are, are rewiring neural circuitry in a common way
despite a diversity of experience while on the drug. And that itself
is really interesting. And it takes us back to a place that we've been
before in this discussion, which is layer five of the cortex. This
area that ketamine seems to impact as well by generating rhythms of
the, I mentioned one to three Hertz activity in layer five of certain
areas of the cortex. Well, the 5HT1A receptor is known to be enriched
in layer five of the cortex, and layer five of the cortex is a very
interesting area because it's an area in which there's a lot of
lateral connectivity. So connections between different brain areas
laterally, generally is what allows us to merge different senses. So
for instance, when we hear a sound off to our right over here, we turn
to our right. There's a very hardwired response. And typically we hear
something off to our right, we don't look to our left. That's how
hardwired some of these circuits are. What appears to be happening is
that the activation of the serotonin system and 5HT1A receptor in
layer five is offering up or providing an experience whereby the
lateral connections are able to engage much more broadly than they
would normally. Now that also could be a bad thing. And I asked Matt
about this, that sounds kind of spooky. I don't know that when I hear
something off to my right, that I want to look off to my left. That
could be highly maladaptive, especially if it's a car coming at me
from my right. That doesn't seem to be what's happening. It's not
really rewiring these deeply reflexive circuits. It's somehow rewiring
associations between events, emotional events, past events, current
events, and future events in ways that allow people to get some sort
of relief or distance from these narratives, these depressive stories
about their past and present and allow them to see new opportunity and
optimism in the future. It's really a fascinating thing if you really
think about it, because I would have thought that simply by ramping up
laterality of connections, meaning that cross associations, that
things could either be rewired randomly in ways that don't serve us,
or would perhaps just cause no effect at all. So it's either going to
be bad or neutral, but that's not really the way things are turning
out. Again, these are highly controlled studies. I do want to
emphasize that ketamine, psilocybin, these things are still illegal.
Most all places. There are some regions and cities in the United
States where they are locally decriminalized, but they are not legal.
They're still illegal. So what we're referring to here are indeed
clinical studies in which people are taking them legally. I think it's
very likely we will see a shift in the legislature around
psychedelics, and in particular, psilocybin in the not too distant
future. And I think that for now, what we should know is what Matt
told me and what you'll hear far more about, which is that psilocybin.
this one where in most cases, two dose treatments done in a highly
clinical setting, controlled setting with patients that are carefully
selected, can in many cases, the majority of people receive and
maintain relief from their depressive symptoms, simply through the
experience of this psychedelic journey. I did ask them about micro
dosing. I made it sound as if I'd never heard about it before.
Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, and his answer was
interesting. His answer was that the microdosing effects don't seem to
be nearly as impactful as some of these, well, let's just call them
what they are. These kind of high amplitude sessions that there are
just one or two, there are some studies ongoing where there's more
than two, but that the microdosing doesn't seem to compare to these
macrodosing, I mentioned the dosages before, this 20 milligrams per 70
kilograms or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms dosages given several
weeks apart. So you'll hear more about microdosing and other
psychedelics and their impact on depressive states and major
depression in the episode with Matt. But for the time being, it really
seems as if, again, we're looking at neuroplasticity, we're coming
back to layer five, just like with ketamine and PCP. We're hearing
about layer five, we're hearing about rewiring of circuitry, we're
hearing about a dissociation or a distancing of oneself from these
negative moods and affects and narratives, but there's a key
distinction between the ketamine work and the psilocybin work, which
is that in the ketamine work, it really is about dissociating from
experience during the session with the psychiatrist, whereas during
the psilocybin journey, it's really about immersing oneself in the
experience and being fully present to that experience. That does seem
to be an important component and what the difference is there and why
they both seem to provide some relief from major depression isn't
clear. I think most likely it takes us back to the fact that this
thing we call major depression clearly involves serotonin, dopamine,
and norepinephrine. And in some individuals, they may be more
deficient in one or several of those or all of those, whereas in other
individuals, it might be a different collection of chemicals. And of
course there are a tremendous number of other psychedelic compounds
that people are exploring for treatment of major depression. But
really psilocybin is the one that we have the most data on. MDMA has
mainly been explored in the clinical realm for treatment of trauma.
There are some trials ongoing for treatment of depression, but the big
breakthrough seemed to be happening in the realm of trauma treatment,
the so-called maps group that's doing this, again, legally in a
clinical setting. And there are other groups that are starting to do
it as well. We are going to do an entire podcast about MDMA and some
related compounds. So I'll save that discussion for then. One of the
most common questions I get for this podcast is about different diets,
different regimes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=6420"&gt;Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, or
vegan diets, or intermittent fasting, or the all meat diet, the so-
called lion diet, et cetera. There are actually really interesting
data relating nutrition and diet to major depressive disorder. And I
think we just need to frame this by returning to something that was
said earlier, which is that the ingestion of carbohydrates, in
particular carbohydrates and some meats like turkey, that are rich in
tryptophan, this precursor to serotonin, are in many ways the self-
medicating version of depression treatment. Now, to be clear, I'm not
saying that people should use food to medicate their depression. Many
people do that reflexively however, they reach for carbohydrate rich
foods to blunt their cortisol, because that's indeed what it does. It
blunts cortisol when you ingest high carbohydrate foods, in particular
starchy foods, and it does increase serotonin, in particular, if those
foods rather are rich in the amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food
is wonderful and important and great, but ingesting excessive foods of
any kinds, carbohydrate or otherwise it's not healthy, of course.
There have been some explorations of whether or not a vegan diet can
improve symptoms of depression. Not a lot of data, not impressive
data. There have been very few controlled studies looking at the
carnivore or all meat diet. On that, I think there are now some that
are starting to spin up, meaning those studies are starting to spin
up. However, the ketogenic diet has been explored for its ability to
relieve certain symptoms of depression, in particular to what's called
maintain euthymia. Euthymia is the kind of state of equilibrium
between a manic episode and a depressive episode in a manic bipolar
person. We'll return to this more in a future episode, but it
basically, maniacs have highs and they have lows, bipolars, either
cycle back and forth really quickly. So rapid cycling bipolars or
slow, some people So really quickly can be day to day, other people
it's month to month or week to week, they're going highs and lows. And
you hear about mania and you hear about dysphoria, euthymia is that
kind of place in the middle where people feel neither too high nor too
low. And there are some interesting studies looking at the ketogenic
diet for maintaining euthymia in manic depressives, but also in people
with major depressive disorder. Why would this work? Well, we have to
remember that the ketogenic diet wasn't discovered so that self
appointed nutrition gurus could talk about it online or so that people
could make money selling anything related to ketosis. And here I'm not
disparaging of the ketogenic diet. It's helped a lot of people. The
ketogenic diet was actually shown to be medically relevant for its use
to treat epilepsy. It turns out that in epilepsy, or in particular
pediatric epilepsy, that a ketogenic diet and the shift of brain
metabolism to predominantly one in which ketones are being metabolized
rather than more standard glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce
the number of epileptic seizures that these children experience. It's
not always the case, but it's often the case. And so you talk to a
neurologist or a neurosurgeon who's specialized in epilepsy, in
particular pediatric epilepsy, and they'll tell you this, "Oh yeah,
the ketogenic diet, in many cases, not all, "can be very effective for
this treatment." How? How is it that a ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, the way it reduces seizures is by increasing what's
called GABA transmission. GABA is a substance that is naturally
released in our brain. It's an inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning
that when it's released into the synapse, it has the tendency to
reduce the firing, to reduce the electrical activity of the next
neuron or sets of neurons. There are various compounds that increase
GABA, in particular, GABA in the forebrain. One common example would
be something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic drink or two will
increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower your social
inhibitions by increasing your neurochemical inhibition. It basically
suppresses the self-monitoring pathways. And if people drink enough,
it will suppress all pathways and people will urinate themselves and
fall over. It will eventually inhibit all sorts of pathways. So the
GABA system has a rich array of effects all over the brain and body.
But alcohol tends to activate the release of GABA. You might say, well
then why not just take alcohol to suppress seizures? Well, that be a
terrible idea because there tends to be a rebound excitability after
alcohol stops having its effects on the GABA receptors. And so then
there's an excitability for which an epilepsy would be terrible. The
reason why the epileptic diet is useful for epilepsy is that increases
what we call the tonic level, the sort of the ti, the level of GABA in
the brain, and that suppresses some of the hyperexcitability, that is
the characteristic feature of epilepsy. And there are other drugs, for
instance, the benzodiazepines and things of the Xanax, variety,
Valium, and so forth. Those increased GABA transmission. Those drugs
also have a lot of potential for abuse and addiction, et cetera, and
they're problematic for other reasons. But the ketogenic diet, by way
of increasing ketone metabolism or shifting brain's metabolism over to
ketones tends to modulate GABA such that GABA is more active and
adjust the so-called GABA glutamate balance. This is getting
technical, but glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, GABA is
inhibitory neurotransmitter, and their balance is vital for
neuroplasticity, for maintaining healthy levels of activity in the
brain, et cetera. And so there is decent evidence that people with
major depressive disorders, in particular, the people with major
depressive disorders that are refractory, meaning they don't respond
to classical antidepressants, can benefit, it seems, from the
ketogenic diet. Now this is not always the case, but for those of you
out there who are struggling with major depression, and for which
drugs have not worked, please talk to your psychiatrist. I don't know
how many of them are up on the literature about the ketogenic diet or
the EPAs and the rest. Psychiatrists vary in terms of how involved in
the current literature they tend to be, but there are many excellent
psychiatrists out there. Most of them in my experience, are actually
quite avid learners about what's happening and what's new in this
realm that they call psychiatry. So it's really interesting that
eating in a particular way, lowering carbohydrates to the point where
you rely on ketogenic metabolism in the brain, increases GABA and can
provide some relief for depressive symptoms. And that in particular,
that seems to have positive effects in people that are refractory or
don't respond to classic antidepressants. And that would include
things like fluoxetine, et cetera. I'll make one final point about
ketogenic diets and GABA and depression, which is that it's also been
shown that for people that respond well to these drugs that impact the
serotonin system, dopamine system, or norepinephrine, the ketogenic
diet, there may improve the ability for those drugs to work at lower
dosages, which is reminiscent of what we saw with the EPA
supplementation. So today we've covered what at least feels to me,
like a tremendous amount of material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;amp;t=6890"&gt;Summary of Protocols Covered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic of depression is indeed an enormous topic to try and get
our arms around. We talked about the symptomology, we talked about
some of the underlying neurochemistry and biology, and then we talked
about approaches to deal with it that are really grounded in the
neurochemistry in biology. I just want to recap a few of those tools
and what those things are. First of all, we talked about making the
effort to not overwhelm the pleasure system. That might seem
counterintuitive. To not overly seek out pleasure, or else one can
find themselves in a place of depression. I mentioned way back at the
beginning of the episode, a young man who I know to be really
struggling with depression, and it is thought, and we don't know for
sure, but is thought that some of that depression was probably
triggered by an overindulgence in video games and other highly
dopaminergic activities to the point where those activities eventually
were countered by the pain balance that Dr. Anna Lembke described. And
he now has to do those activities repeatedly and for many, many hours
each day, just to feel okay, not even to derive pleasure from them.
And worse, many other activities, practically all other activities
have lost their zest, they've lost their excitement and his sense of
pleasure for them. And so there's a really active campaign now to
reset that system. So, number one, don't overwhelm your pleasure
centers either through activities or compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, but you're setting yourself up for anhedonia and
depression if you do that. It's not just about addiction that too, but
it's also about setting yourself for anhedonia and depression. How
often can you engage in these activities? Well, that's going to differ
from person to person, everyone's slightly different, but you should
really mind your extreme highs and your extreme lows and be cautious
about those. We'll probably have a Dr. Lembke on again at a future
time to try and get some more specifics about that. But if you do feel
like you need to reset that system, it really does seem like a 30 day
complete detox from whatever activity or substance that is. And
ideally it doesn't continue after that 30 days, especially in
conditions of drugs of abuse. Second of all, talks about the
norepinephrine system and how the norepinephrine system is really
deficient in many forms of major depression. And in depression, there
is now more deliberate pursuit of nor epinephrin inducing activities
that are healthy, that aren't adrenaline seeking per se, things like
cold showers, things like particular patterns of breathing that engage
and tend to make us more alert, things like exercise that will
increase our levels of noradrenaline. I'd be remiss if I said that
these activities could completely eliminate depressive symptoms in
people with major depressive disorder. I don't think that's the case.
And again, I want to acknowledge that people with major depressive
symptoms often don't have the energy, the willingness, or the capacity
to engage in some of these activities, but things like cold shower,
deliberate cold showers, things like regular exercise, they aren't
just feel good activities. They actually engage the norepinephrine
system and keep that system tuned up and allow us to increase our
norepinephrine levels at will on a regular basis. And their mood
enhancing effects are real effects at the level of neurochemistry,
then we talked about EPAs, Essential Fatty Acids, and it's clear that
for most people, getting above 1000 milligrams and probably even
closer to 2000 milligrams per day of EPAs can be beneficial for mood,
especially in attempts to treat or offset major depressive disorder.
Are there side effects? Well, you need to explore those for yourself
and with your doctor, everyone has a different health background. For
the margins of safety, for most people would probably be quite large,
but for some people that might not be the case. So definitely check
with your physician. We also talked about exercise and how EPA and
exercise on a regular basis can offset these inflammatory pathways. I
want to mention something I've mentioned on a previous podcast, but in
terms of keeping the Inflammatone, all these molecules that create
inflammation, and then the inflammation can limit the amount of
serotonin through the pathways we described. In order to do that, it's
also very, very useful to ingest two to four servings of fermented
foods on a daily basis or near daily basis. These are data that were
published by the Sonnenberg Lab at Stanford recently in the journal
Cell, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal that ingestion of these
fermented foods really keeps the gut microbiome tuned up, so to speak,
well in order to offset these inflammatory cytokines, keeping
inflammation at bay, it just turns out to be a really good thing in
order to keep our mood in a good place. So EPA, exercise, fermented
foods, creatine as a potential source of relief from depression or
offsetting, or keeping us away from major depression or relapse into
depression. And then we talked about the prescription compounds and
the compounds that are being used mainly in the course of studies and
of psychiatry and depression, things like ketamine, PCP, psilocybin,
and related compounds. And then lastly, we talked about ketosis, which
may not be right for everybody, but might be right for certain
individuals out there who are grappling with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. Today I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Anna Lembke.
Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist and the chief of the Addiction Medicine
Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. She's
a psychiatrist who treats patients struggling with addiction. She has
successfully treated patients dealing with drug addiction, alcohol
addiction, and behavioral addictions, such as gambling and sex
addiction, as well as other types of addiction. In fact, during our
discussion, I learned that there are a huge range of behaviors and
substances to which people can become addicted to, and that there is a
common biological underpinning of all those addictions. I also learned
that there is a common path to the treatment and recovery from
essentially all addictions. Dr. Lembke explained that to me and
explained how to think about and conceptualize our own addictions, as
well as the addictions of other people who are struggling to get
treatment, move through treatment, and stay sober from their
addictions. In addition to treating patients, Dr. Lembke is an author
and was featured in the 2020 Netflix documentary, "The Social
Dilemma". I'm excited to tell you that she has a new book coming out
called "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence".
The book comes out August 24th and is an absolutely fascinating read
into addiction and ways to treat various types of addiction. I've read
the book cover to cover, and all I'll tell you is that at the very
first chapter and throughout, you are going to be absolutely blown
away. The stories about her patients are extremely engaging. It brings
forward the real struggle of addiction and the incredible, I think
it's fair to say heroic battles, that people fight in order to get
through addictions of various kinds. And all of that is woven through
with story, with science, in ways that make it very accessible to
anyone, whether or not you have a science background or not. I can't
recommend it highly enough. So again, the book is "Dopamine Nation,
Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence", it comes out August 24th of
this year, 2021. And you can pre-order that book by going to Amazon.
We will provide a link to that in the show caption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=145"&gt;Disclaimer &amp;amp; Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Headspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, I just want to mention that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of
my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about
science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping
with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA make sunglasses and eyeglasses that
are of the absolute utmost quality. Founded by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford, everything about the sunglasses and eye
glasses that ROKA makes was designed with performance in mind. First
of all, they're very lightweight. You don't even really notice that
they're on your face. Second of all, even if you get sweaty, they
don't slip off. In fact, they were designed to be worn at work or
around the house, but also if you're running or biking. So you can
move seamlessly between different activities without having to change
your sunglasses or eyeglasses. In addition, the lenses are designed
with the science of the visual system in mind. I've spent my career
working on the science of the visual system, and I can tell you that
it's not trivial to build a lens that allows you to see with perfect
clarity, whether or not you're in bright sunshine and then move into
shadows. But the ROKA glasses allow you to do that. You always see
things with absolute clarity. Another terrific thing about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses is the aesthetic. A lot of so-called
performance sunglasses and eyeglasses, they're not really built with
the best aesthetic and they kind of make people look like cyborgs.
With ROKA, they have a lot of different styles to choose from, but all
those styles are the sort that you could wear out to dinner or to
work, or when engaging in physical activity. If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses you can go to ROKA, that's R-O-K-A dot com, and enter the code
Huberman at checkout. And if you do that, you'll get 20% off your
first order. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and
reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood
work done. And I've been doing that for a number of years, for the
simple reason that most, if not all of the factors, that impact your
immediate and long-term health, can only be analyzed in detail with a
quality blood test. And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, you
can get further insight into what's going on beneath the hood, so to
speak. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however, is you
get numbers back, you get the levels back of various things and you
find out if certain things are too high or too low or right on target,
but there are no directives about how to move those numbers in the
direction that you would want them to go. With InsideTracker, they
have a dashboard that makes all of that very easy, and that dashboard
takes your numbers and can help direct you towards particular
lifestyle factors, nutrition factors, exercise, supplementation, et
cetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are
right for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker you can go to
insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get 25% off any
of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a
meditation app that's backed by 25 published peer review studies and
has over 600,000 5-star reviews. I've been meditating for a very long
time. I'm 45-years-old now, almost 46, and I started meditating when I
was about 15-years-old. The problem, however, is keeping up a
meditation practice. I've experienced this myself. I've had periods of
time where I'm meditating regularly and then periods of time where I
just kind of fall off the rails and I'm just not doing it at all.
There's now tons of evidence, evidence from neuroscience, evidence
from psychology, evidence from areas of biology focused on stress and
the immune system, that a meditation practice, when done regularly, is
extremely beneficial for mental and physical health, and things like
focus and creativity. However, you have to do the meditation practice,
and so if you're not doing it regularly, that's a serious problem. And
if you are doing it regularly, great. With Headspace, I find that I
can stick to a meditation practice very easily. In fact, that's why I
started using it and that's why I continue to use it. I try and get a
meditation practice in every day, but sometimes that requires that it
be a brief meditation practice. With Headspace, they have a huge range
of different meditations of different durations, and so that's really
helpful in building and maintaining these powerful meditation
practices. If you want to try Headspace you can go to
headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get a free one
month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations. This is the
best deal offered by Headspace. Basically you get access to everything
they've got, completely free, for a one month trial. So if you'd like
to try that, go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And now for my
discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=420"&gt;Dopamine, Happiness &amp;amp; Impulsivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, great to have you here. Thank you for having me, I'm
excited to be here. Yeah, I have a lot of questions for you. I, and
many listeners of this podcast, are obsessed with dopamine, and what
is dopamine, how does it work? We all hear that dopamine is this
molecule associated with pleasure. I think the term dopamine hits,
like I'm getting a dopamine hit from this, from Instagram, or from
likes or from praise or from whatever, is now commonly heard. What is
dopamine, and what are maybe some things about dopamine that most
people don't know? And probably that I don't know either. So dopamine
is a neurotransmitter, and neurotransmitters are those molecules that
bridge the gap between two neurons. So they essentially allow one
neuron, the pre-synaptic neuron, to communicate with the post-synaptic
neuron. Dopamine is intimately associated with the experience of
reward, but also with movement, which I think is really interesting,
because movement and reward are linked, right? If you think about, you
know, early humans, you had to move in order to go seek out the water
or the meat or whatever it was. And even in the most primitive
organisms, dopamine is released when food is sensed in the
environment. For example, C elegans, a very primitive worm. So
dopamine is this really powerful, important molecule in the brain that
helps us experience pleasure. It's not the only neurotransmitter
involved in pleasure, but it's a really, really important one. And if
you want to think about something that most people don't know about
dopamine, which I think is really interesting, is that we are always
releasing dopamine at a kind of tonic baseline rate. And it's really
the deviation from that baseline, rather than like hits of dopamine in
a vacuum, that make a difference. So when we experience pleasure, our
dopamine release goes above baseline, and likewise dopamine can go
below that tonic baseline, and then we experience a kind of pain.
Interesting. So is it fair to say that one's baseline levels of
dopamine, how frequently we are releasing dopamine, in the absence of
some, I don't know, drug or food or experience, just sitting, being,
is that associated with how happy somebody is, their kind of baseline
of happiness or level of depression? There is evidence that shows that
people who are depressed may indeed have lower tonic levels of
dopamine. So that's a really reasonable thought, and there is some
evidence to suggest that that may be true. The other thing that we
know, and this is really kind of what the book is about, is that if we
expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors that
repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine in our brains reward
pathway, that we can change our tonic baseline and actually lower it
over time, as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine,
which is more really than we were designed to experience. Interesting
and is, is it the case that our baseline levels of dopamine are set by
our genetics, by our heredity? Well I think, you know, if you think
about sort of, you know, the early stages of development and infancy,
certainly that is true. You're kind of, you know, born with probably
whatever is your baseline level. But obviously your experiences can
have a huge impact on where your dopamine level ultimately settles
out. So if somebody's disposition is one of constant excitement and
anticipation, or easily excited, I think about the kind of people
where you say hey, do you want to check out this new place for tacos,
and they're like "Yeah, that'd be great!" And other people are a
little more cynical, harder to budge. Like my bulldog Costello. Very,
very stable, low levels of dopamine with big inflections in his case.
Do you think that's set in terms of our parents, and obviously nature
and nurture interact, but is that, is dopamine at the core of our
temperament? I don't really think we know the answer to that, but I
will say that people are definitely born with different temperaments,
and those temperaments do affect their ability to experience joy. And,
you know, we've known that for a long time, and we describe that in
many different ways. One of the ways that we describe that in the
modern era is to use psychiatric nomenclature. Like this person has a
dysthymic temperament, or, you know, this person has chronic major
depressive disorder. In terms of looking specifically at who's
vulnerable to addiction, that's an interesting sort of mixed bag
because when you look at the research on risk factors for addiction,
so what kind of temperament of a person makes them more vulnerable to
addiction, you see some interesting findings. First you see that
people who are more impulsive are more vulnerable to addiction. So
what is impulsivity? That means having difficulty putting space
between the thought or desire to do something, and actually doing it.
And people who have difficulty putting a space there, who have a
thought to do something and just do it impulsively, are people who are
more vulnerable to addiction. Interesting. Could I, in terms of
impulsivity, is this something that relates literally to the startle
reflex? Like I, for instance, as a lab director, I'm familiar with
walking around my lab and when I decide, deciding I'm going to talk to
my people, of course when they knock on my door it's always like wait,
why am I being bothered right now? Even though I love to talk to them.
But I walk around my lab from time to time, and some people I notice,
I'll say, do you have a moment, and they'll slowly turn around and
say, yeah, or no, in some cases. And other people will jump the moment
I say their name. They actually have a, a kind of a heightened startle
reflex. Is that related to impulsivity, or is what you're referring to
an attempt to withhold behavior that's very deliberate, under very
deliberate conditions? Yeah, so I don't think that that startle reflex
is necessarily related to impulsivity. That can be related to anxiety.
So people who are high anxiety people will tend to have more of a
startle reflex. Impulsivity is a little bit different. And by the way,
impulsivity is not always bad, right. Impulsivity is that thing where
there's not a lot of self-editing or worrying about future
consequences. You know, you have the idea to do something and you do
it. And of course we can imagine many scenarios where that's
absolutely wonderful. You know, there can be a sort of, let's say
intimate interactions between people, where you wouldn't really want
to be super inhibited about it, right. You would want to be
disinhibited and impulsive. I can also like imagine like sort of fight
or flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right, where it would
really be good to be impulsive and just go rhino! Where hesitation can
cost you your life? Right, yes, that's right, that's right. But, you
know, and I think this brings up a really, something that I've come to
believe after 25 years of practicing psychiatry, is that what we now
conceptualize in our current ecosystem as mental illness, are actually
traits that in another ecosystem might be very advantageous. They're
just not advantageous right now, because of the world that we live in.
And I think, you know, impulsivity is potentially one of those, right?
'Cause we live in this world that's sort of like, you have to
constantly be thinking sort of rationally about the consequences of X,
Y, or Z. And it's such a sensory rich environment, right, that we're
being bombarded with all of these opportunities, these sensory
opportunities. And we have to constantly check ourselves. And so
impulsivity is something that right now can be a difficult trait, but
isn't in and of itself a bad thing. I see. And it's, I'm beginning to
realize it's a fine line between spontaneity and impulsivity. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=956"&gt;What Is Pleasure?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is pleasure and how does it work, at the biological level, and if
it feels right, at the psychological level? And if you don't mind
painting a picture of sort of the range of things that you have
observed in your clinic, or in life, that people can become addicted
to. But just to start off really simply, what is this thing that we
call pleasure? Well, I think it's actually really hard to define
pleasure in any kind of succinct way, because certainly there is the
seeking out of a high, or a euphoria, or I think, you know, the kind
of experience that almost anybody would associate with the word
pleasure. But also the seeking out of those same substances and
behaviors is often a way to escape pain. So for example, when I talk
to people with addiction, sometimes their initial foray into using a
drug is to get pleasure, but very often it's a way to escape their
suffering, whatever their suffering may be. And certainly as people
become addicted, even those who initially were seeking out pleasure
are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain of withdrawal or the pain
of the consequences of their drug use. So I think it's, you know, very
hard to actually, you know, define it as this unitary thing. And it's
certainly not just getting a high. There are so many ways in which
people sort of want to escape, which is not the same thing as sort of
this hedonic, you know, wanting to feel pleasure. So someone could
decide that they want to go out and dance, or get up and dance,
because of the pleasure of dancing. I can imagine that. But, and maybe
it's very difficult for them to stay seated when a particular song
comes on, for instance. But seeking what we would call pleasure in
order to eliminate pain, that evokes a different picture in my mind.
That evokes a picture of somebody that feels lost or depressed or
underwhelmed. I definitely want to get into the precise and general
description of addiction and what that is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=1100"&gt;Addiction, Boredom &amp;amp; Passion for Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but in a previous conversation we had, you said something that really
rung in my mind, which is that many people who become addicted to
things, let's call them addicts, have this feeling that normal life
isn't interesting enough. That they are seeking a super normal
experience, and that the day-to-day routine balance, which is actually
in the title of your book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the
Age of Indulgence", that the word balance itself can sometimes be a
bit of an adversive term for people. And I'm struck by this idea, and
the reason I want to explore it is because so much of what I see
online is about generating a lack of balance, about being tilted
forward at all times, really leaning into life hard, experiencing
life, you know, living a full life. Even the commencement speech given
by Steve Jobs on this campus was really about finding passion,
digging. You know, that's so much in the narrative now. So maybe you
could just tell us a little bit about your experience with this
association, if it really exists, between people's sense of the
normalcy, or maybe even how boring life can be, and their tendency to
become addicts of some sort. Yeah, well, I mean, I think that life for
humans has always been hard, but I think that now it's harder in
unprecedented ways. And I think that the way that life is really hard
now is that it actually is really boring. And the reason that it's
boring is because all of our survival needs are met, right? I mean, we
don't even have to leave our homes to meet every single physical need,
you know, as long as you're of a certain level of financial wellbeing,
which frankly, you know, we talk so much about, you know, the income
gap, and certainly there is this enormous gap between rich and poor.
But that gap is smaller than it's ever been in like the history of
humans. Even the poorest of the poor have more excess income to spend
on leisure goods, than they ever have before in human history. If you
look at leisure time, for example, so people without a high school
education have 42% more leisure time than people with a college
degree. So my point here is that life is hard now in this really weird
way, in that we don't really have anything that we have to do. So
we're all forced to make stuff up, you know, whether it's being a
scientist or being a doctor, or being an Olympic athlete, or, you
know, climbing Mount Everest. And people really vary in their need for
friction. And some people need a lot more than others. And if they
don't have it, they're really, really unhappy. And I do think that a
lot of the people that I see with addiction and other forms of mental
illness are people who need more friction. Like they're unhappy, not
necessarily because there's something wrong with their brain, but
because their brain is not suited to this world. And do you think they
have that sense, my brain isn't suited to this world, or they simply
feel a restlessness and they're constantly seeking stimulation? I
think that's right, yeah. I think it's not really knowing what's wrong
with me, and why am I unhappy, how can I be happier? And of course, as
you talk about, what's so pervasive in our narrative now is like find
your passion, you know, find your, you know, out of whatever it is, to
save the world. And in a way that's good because it has people out in
the world and seeking. But in a way it can also be misleading in the
sense that I think people aren't entirely aware that the world is a
hard place, and that life is hard, and that, you know, like we're all
kind of making it up. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Well there's a
book by Cal Newport, I don't know if you know Cal Newport's work, but
you guys are very symbiotic in your messages. He's a professor of
computer science at Georgetown. Yes, at Georgetown. And wrote a book
some years ago, really ahead of its time, called "So Good They Can't
Ignore You", which is about not meditating or doing much work to try
and figure out what one's passion is by thinking, but rather go out
and acquire skills, Right. and develop a sense of passion for
something by your experience of hard work and getting better end
feedback. Right. - A little bit of the growth mindset, think of our
colleague Carol Dweck. But he's gone on to write books, "Deep Work",
which is all about removing yourself from technology and doing deep
work. Yes, right. And he's been a big proponent of the evils of
context switching too often throughout the day. [Anna] Yeah. For sake
of productivity, mostly. His new book is called "A World Without
Email." I'm beginning to realize, as I cite off these books and your
book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence",
that maybe the reason why you two don't know about one another is
because neither of you are on social media. That's it. Right. - That's
it. And yet you're two of the most productive people that I know,
including productive authors. So that's a discussion unto itself. But
I find this fascinating. So let's talk about the pleasure pain balance
and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=1440"&gt;Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I've heard you use this seesaw or balance scale, Right. - analogy
before. And I think it's a wonderful one that really, for me,
clarified what addiction is, at least at the mechanistic level. Yeah,
so to me, one of the most significant findings in neuroscience in the
last 75 years is that pleasure and pain are co-located, which means
the same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain.
And they work like a balance. So when we feel pleasure, our balance
tips one way, when we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction.
And one of the overriding rules governing this balance is that it
wants to stay level. So it doesn't want to remain tipped very long to
pleasure or to pain. And with any deviation from neutrality, the brain
will work very hard to restore a level balance, or what scientists
call homeostasis. And the way the brain does that is with any stimulus
to one side, there will be a tip in equal and opposite amount to the
other side. It's like the principle laws of physics. Yes, right,
right. So like, I like to watch YouTube videos. When I watch YouTube
videos of "American Idol", you know, it tips to the side of pleasure.
And then when I stop watching it, I have a comedown, right, which is a
tip to the equal and opposite amount on the other side. And that's
that moment of wanting to watch one more YouTube video, right. Yeah,
and I just want to interject there. So this moment of wanting to watch
another, that is associated with pain, I think, is, are we always
aware of that happening? Because you just described it in a very
conscious way. Right. But when I indulge in something I enjoy, I'm
usually thinking about just wanting Yes, yes. - more of that thing. I
don't think about the pain, Yes. - I just think about more. Right. So
really excellent point because we're mostly not aware of it. And it's
also reflexive. So it's not something that consciously happens, or
that we're aware of, unless we really begin to pay attention. And when
we begin to pay attention, we really can become very aware of it in
the moment. Again, it's like a falling away. You're on social media
and, you know, you get a good tweet of something, and then you can't
stop yourself because there's this awareness, a latent awareness, that
as soon as I disengage from this behavior, I'm going to experience a
kind of a pain, right. A falling away, a missing that feeling, a
wanting more of it. And of course, one way to combat that is to do it
more, right, and more, and more, and more. So I think that is really
what I want people to tune into and get an awareness around. Because
once you tune into it, you can see it a lot. And then when you begin
to see it, you have an, if you keep the model of the balance in mind,
I think it gives people kind of a way to imagine what they're
experiencing on a neuro-biological level, and understand it. And in
that understanding, get some mastery over it, which is really what
this is all about. Because ultimately we do need to disengage, right?
We can't live in that space all the time, right. We have other things
we need to do. And there are also serious consequences that come with
trying to repeat and continue that experience or that feeling. Yeah,
so if I understand this correctly, when we find something, or when
something finds us, that we enjoy, that feels pleasureful, social
media, food, sex, gambling, whatever it happens to be, and we will
explore the full range of these, there's some dopamine release when we
engage in that behavior. And then what you're telling me is that very
quickly, [Anna] Yes. and beneath my conscious awareness, there's a
tilting back of the scale where pleasure is reduced, by way of
increasing pain. Right. And I've heard you say before that the pain
mechanism has some competitive advantages over the pleasure
mechanisms, such that it doesn't just bring the scale back to level.
It actually brings pain higher than pleasure. Could you tell us a
little bit more about that? Yeah, yeah. So what happens, again, so the
hallmark of any addictive substance or behavior is that it releases a
lot of dopamine in our brains reward pathway. Like, right, like
broccoli just doesn't release a lot of dopamine, just doesn't, right.
I'm trying to imagine, I was about to say, maybe you, and I stopped
myself because. Broccoli's good, it can be really good, but broccoli
is never amazing. Right. Broccoli's never amazing. We're never like, -
I mean this is the most amazing broccoli. Honestly we can probably
find somebody on the planet for whom broccoli is amazing. And of
course if I'm starving, broccoli is amazing. Rich Roll. Rich Roll is
big on plants, and he has a good relationship to plants. Rich, tell us
how to make broccoli amazing. If anyone could do it it'd be Rich.
Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=1750"&gt;Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens right after I do something that is really pleasurable
and releases a lot of dopamine, is again, my brain is going to
immediately compensate by down-regulating my own dopamine receptors,
my own dopamine transmission, to compensate for that, okay. And that's
that come down, or the hangover, that after-effect, that moment of
wanting to do it more. Now, if I just wait for that feeling to pass,
then my dopamine will re-regulate itself and I'll go back to whatever
my chronic baseline is. But if I don't wait, and here's really the
key, if I keep indulging again and again and again, ultimately I have
so much on the pain side, right, that I've essentially reset my brain
to what we call like an anhedonic, or lacking in joy type of state,
which is a dopamine-deficit state. So that's really the way in which
pain can become the main driver, is because I've indulged so much in
these high reward behaviors or substances, that my brain has had to
compensate by way down-regulating my own dopamine, such that even when
I'm not doing that drug, I'm in a dopamine deficit state, which is
akin to a clinical depression. I have anxiety, irritability, insomnia,
dysphoria. And a lot of mental preoccupation with using again, or
getting the drug. And so that's the piece there, there's the single
use, which easily passes, but it's the chronic use that can then reset
really our dopamine thresholds, and then nothing is enjoyable, right?
Then everything sort of pales in comparison to this one drug that I
want to keep doing. And that one drug could be a person, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=1847"&gt;Are All Addictions the Same?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I - Yes. I know people in my life that are still talking about
this one relationship, this one person that was just so great, despite
all the challenges of that thing. It's almost like they're addicted to
the narrative. Yeah. They were maybe, or still are, addicted to the
person. So it could be to any number of things, video games, sex,
gambling, a person, a narrative. To me, and because of the way you
describe this mechanism, this pleasure pain balance, that all speaks
to the kind of generalizability of our brain circuitry. And this is
something that fascinates me, and I know it fascinates you as well,
which is that nature did not evolve 20 different mechanisms for 20
different types of addiction. Just like anxiety is a couple of core
sets of hormones and neurotransmitters and pathways, and one person is
triggered by social interactions, another person is triggered by
spiders. But the underlying response is identical. It sounds like with
addiction as well, there may be some nuance, but that there's sort of
a core set of processes. So it doesn't really matter if it's gambling
or video games or sex or a narrative about a previous lover or
partner, whatever. It's the same addictive process underneath that. Is
that correct? Yes, exactly. And that's where this whole idea of cross-
addiction comes in. So once you've been addicted to a substance,
severely addicted, that makes you more vulnerable to addiction to any
substance. And when you say substance, does the same, is what you just
said also true for behaviors? Yes, so, when I use the word drug I'm
talking about substances and behaviors really. I'm talking about
behaviors like gambling, sex, you know, Porn. - gaming, porn,
absolutely, shopping. Work. Work. You've accused me, I'll just, for
the record, Anna, Dr. Lembke's accused me, not accused me, has
diagnosed me outside the clinic, in a playful way, of being work-
addicted. You're probably right. The first thoughts I have when I wake
up are typically about work. Certainly within 50 milliseconds or so of
waking. And probably the last thoughts I have, I would hope are not
about work, but yeah, I work constantly. I do other things, but I have
to actively turn that off. Yes. That's exactly right. And you're
certainly not alone in that. And of course At Stanford, no, no no no.
And we're here in Silicon Valley, right, it's highly rewarded, right.
So that kind of addiction. It's embedded in the culture. - Oh yeah,
absolutely. - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. And there's this other city, I
think it's called New York, where they also work a lot I hear, and
it's heavily rewarded. I once said, and I'm sure that I'm not the
first person to say it, but I was thinking about addiction, and I was
thinking about the underlying circuits and I posted something to
social media which said that addiction is a progressive narrowing of
the things that bring you pleasure. That was the way that I kind of
crystallized the literature in my mind. And then we met and you of
course came and gave these amazing lectures in the neuroanatomy course
for the medical students, and the rest is history. But I tossed out a
kind of mirroring statement for that as well, which was a bit
overstepping, I admit, which I said, addiction is a progressive
narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. And I said, dare I
say, enlightenment is a progressive expansion of the things that bring
you pleasure. Not that anybody knows what enlightenment is, but it was
my attempt to take a little bit of a jab at the fact that nobody
knows. And so why not, why wouldn't I throw a neurobiological
explanation? Just to kind of sample the waters. And people had varying
levels of response but I would've, the reason I bring that up is that
I would imagine that being able to derive pleasure from many things
would be a wonderful attribute. You know people like this, that can
experience pleasure in little things and in big events. Not just, you
know, the big milestones of life, but also the subtle, you know, as
the, like the yogis would say, the subtle ripples of life. If such an
ability exists, do you think that that reflects a healthily tuned
dopamine system? One that can engage and enjoy, but then disengage. Is
that what we should be seeking? And to underscore, I know nothing
about enlightenment meditation, or any of it. I just, I use these as
opportunities to explore. Yeah, so it's a great question and I
understand the question as, so what should we be striving for, right?
Where should we settle out? And, you know, in my book, I really hold
out people in recovery from severe addiction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=2138"&gt;Boredom &amp;amp; Anxiety Lead to Creativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as sort of modern day prophets for the rest of us, because I do think
that people who have been addicted and then get into recovery, do have
a hard won wisdom that we can all benefit from. And the wisdom, I
guess, you know, to distill it down, I mean it's many things. But in
terms of, you know, dopamine, the wisdom is there are adaptive ways to
get your dopamine. And there are less than adaptive ways. And in
general, you could describe the adaptive ways as not too potent. So
not tipping that balance too hard or too fast to the side of pleasure.
So does that mean never allowing myself to be absolutely in complete
bliss? Or does it mean not allowing myself to stay in that state too
long? The latter. I think the latter. Then that gets to temperament,
so I'm going to get that to a second. So, in general, what we want is
some kind of flexibility in that balance, and the ability to easily
reassert homeostasis. We don't want to break our balance, which is
possible if we overindulge for enough period of time and end up with a
balance tipped to the side of pain, this dopamine deficit state we've
been talking about. We want a flexible, resilient balance, right,
which can be sensitive to things going on in the environment, which
can experience pleasure and approach, which can experience pain and
recoil, right? This is all adaptive and healthy and necessary and
good. We would never want a balance that doesn't tilt. Right. That
would be a disaster, we wouldn't be human. And we wouldn't want that,
it'd be really, really boring. On the other hand, what people in
recovery from addiction talk about is, to some extent having to learn
to live with things being a little boring a lot of the time, right? So
trying to avoid some of this intensity and thrill-seeking and
escapism, that really is at the core of addictive tendencies. Sorry to
interrupt, but when you say boring, can we add stressful and boring?
Yes. Because there are days where I'm not, I'm one of these people
that have to remind myself to have fun, Yes. - because I sort of
forgot what the term means, because I like to think that I experience
a lot of pleasure in little things, but I'm a pretty hard-driving guy.
I like goals and big milestones and all that stuff. Anyway. The point
being that many days I'm not bored thinking oh, there's nothing to do,
but I am kind of overwhelmed by the number of things that are really
not pleasureful that I have to do. - Yeah, right. I won't mention what
they are, 'cause I don't my colleagues to be like that's why you don't
respond to emails. No, just your email. Not yours Anna, but theirs. In
any event, so anxiety and boredom can hang out together, right? Am I
correct in? Oh, for sure. I mean, actually boredom is highly anxiety-
provoking. Okay. That's good to know, 'cause I think people hear
boredom and they think like, oh, there's nothing to do here. [Anna]
Right. There's nothing. I feel like we have a ton to do, we just don't
really want to do it. Right, right. As opposed to something that we're
excited to do. Right, okay, so this gets to sort of some of the core
things. Also we were talking about earlier about finding your passion.
So I'm going to try to link it all together. But basically boredom,
first of all boredom is a rare experience for modern humans, because
we're constantly distracting ourselves from the present moment, and we
have an infinite number of ways to do that, right. But boredom is
really, I think, an important and necessary experience. But it is
scary because when you allow yourself to be bored, let's say you were,
had that list of all the things you hate to do, but you actually got
them all done. Imagine that. And you got your forthcoming book done,
and you did all your interviews. It could happen! Lightning could
strike. - Right. And you walked your dog, and you cleaned your house,
and you went shopping. Imagine that for a moment. You would be sitting
in your house, and my guess is you would be terrified because, wow,
what am I supposed to do now, right? There's nothing I really have to
do. And that is really, really scary. That can feel like free fall.
And yet that's really an important and good experience to have. And I
think that is an experience out of which we can have a lot of creative
initiative, but also really consider our priorities and values. Okay,
here I am on planet Earth. What the he-haw am I going to do with my
life? What do I really care about? How do I really want to spend my
time, when I'm not distracting myself, you know, in order to spend it.
And, you know, then this gets back to our conversation a little bit
earlier about finding your passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=2435"&gt;Finding Your Passion Starts with Boredom &amp;amp; Action Steps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that one of the big problems now that's very misguided
about this idea of finding your passion, it's almost as if people are
looking to fit the key into the lock of the thing that was meant for
them to do. Right, and then everything will feel like a natural
progression? Right, and then everything will be wonderful. I can
attest to the fact that is not how it works in any endeavor. - Yeah,
right. And that you'll have all this great success or. And here's
where I really think the answer lies. And I really, really believe
this. Stop looking for your passion and instead look around right
where you are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right where you
are, and see what needs to be done. So not what do I want to do, but
what is the work that needs to be done? And more importantly, it
doesn't have to be some grandiose work. Like does the garbage need to
be taken out, right? Is there some garbage on your neighbor's lawn
that someone threw there, that you could actually bend over and pick
up and put into the garbage can? Look around you. There is so much
work that needs to be done that nobody wants to do. That is really,
really important, and if we all did that, I really think the world
would be a much better place. And this is what people who have severe
addiction, who get into recovery, realize. They're like, it's not
about me and my will and what I'm going to will in my life or in the
world. It's about looking around what needs to be done. What is the
work that I am called to do in this moment? Which also is incredibly
freeing because I don't have to search for the perfect thing. There's
a lot of burden now on young people, that they have to find that
perfect thing, and until they've found that perfect thing, they're
going to be miserable. You don't have to do that. Look at the life you
were given, look at the people around you, look at the jobs that
present themselves to you and do that job simply and honorably, one
day at a time, with a kind of humility. I think this is really what's
so striking to me about the wisdom of people in recovery. There's this
incredible humility that comes out of that experience. You feel so
broken, so ashamed, but you pick yourself up one day at a time and you
build a life that's around what can I do right in this moment, that
might benefit another person, and thereby benefit me? Yeah it's a
really important point, and if you're willing, I'd like to actually
stay on this issue of passion, because I think the dopamine systems,
if I understand them correctly, the dopamine systems merge with this
work that you're referring to, this immediacy of things calling to us,
like taking out the trash, which sounds frankly really boring, to be
honest. I hate taking out the trash, but I do it, 'cause I like a
clean home and I like a home that smells good. Or at least doesn't
smell bad. So we do these things, and not that we want to offer some
larger carrot as a consequence of doing those things. But if I
understand correctly, what you're saying is in the act of looking at
one's immediate environment, acting on that immediate environment, we
cultivate a relationship to these circuits in our brain about action
and reward that, at least to my mind, span the range of small things
being rewarding, and then lead us to the bigger things being
rewarding. It's not like all we're going to do is take out trash and
tend to house. We eventually will venture out, and we eventually will
find careers and work on those. But if I understand correctly, you're
talking about getting into a sort of functional or adaptive action
step, and it's the action step that these days we tend to overlook
because most of our mindset is in things that are truly outside of our
immediate reality. Do I have that correct? Yeah, that was beautifully
said. And I would just add to that, I see a lot of young people who,
for example, spend most of their waking hours playing video games, and
they come to me and they say I am anxious and depressed. I'm majoring
in computer science. I hate it, I thought I would like it. You know,
if I could only find that thing that I was really meant to do, my life
would be better. And my first intervention for the many many people
like that that I see in clinical care is, you have it backwards. I
don't say it quite like that. You were waiting for that thing to pull
you out of the video game world. And you're never going to find it, as
long as you're playing video games. 'Cause video games are so
powerfully dopaminergic that you have this distorted sense of really
pleasure and pain. And you will not be able to find that thing that
you enjoy. And so of course the intervention is abstain from video
games, reset your reward pathways, start with a level balance. And
what invariably happens, and I've just seen it over 20 years so many
times I've become really a believer in this, all of a sudden it's like
oh wow, my computer science class is interesting this quarter. It's
like okay, you know, you have a receptivity then to experiencing
pleasure and reward in a way you just don't have when you're
bombarding your reward pathways with these high dopamine drugs. Very
interesting. And just to underscore this notion that tending to the
immediate things can lead to super performance. I may have mentioned
it earlier this episode, but if I didn't I'll mention it now, which is
I have the great privilege of having some close friends that were in
the SEAL teams and doing some work with those communities. And it's a
remarkable community for reasons that I think most people don't
understand. People think, they see the images, carrying logs down the
beach, and all this, blowing stuff up, all the stuff that's fun for
guys like that. But all of the guys I know who were in the SEAL teams
have this sense of duty about immediate things, and not just holding
the door and doing, helping with the dishes and moving things around.
They are constantly scanning their environment for what can be done.
Ah! They essentially conquer every environment they're in. They are
also some of the most competitive human beings in the world, and they
do it, unless they're in the act of war fighting, which is their real
job. They do it in every environment, in a very benevolent way. And
it's a remarkable thing because it, I think it's what is part of what
they're selected for. And, you know, there's a range there. But I
think when we hear about tending to the immediate things, or this
phrase, you know, how you do one thing is how you do anything. That's
a tricky one for me, because there are certain things I just don't do
well. But should we always be trying? I think that the tending to,
setting the horizon in closely and tending to things in one's
immediate environment, I think is very powerful and translates, Yes. -
because again, I think the nervous system, it performs algorithms. It
has action steps. The brain doesn't evolve to do one thing, it evolves
to be able to use the same approach to doing lots of different things.
Yes. I just want to add, so even beyond that, 'cause that totally
resonates for me, and is very consistent with people in recovery from
addiction who learn to take it one day at a time, which is one of the,
you know, standard lingo from Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step
groups. But I think also, as you say, you know, our brain is really
wired for the 24-hour period. We're not very good at sort of the, you
know, 10 year, 20. I mean we have this huge frontal lobes and yes,
we're great planners and we can, but if we live too much in that
space, we can really get very anxious and depressed and lost, and
either catastrophize or get grandiose. But if you can chunk it down to
a day, what people in recovery talk about is how, if I can just do
today right, then I will get a chain of days that seem insignificant
in their individual units, but after six months or a year or two years
of those good days, I've got two very good years, right, and I look
back and it's like oh wow, I guess I did all that. But I think that's
really, you know, one of the keys, is really taking it one day at a
time, which your SEALs, and also this connecting with the environment,
right? So being awake and alert to your environment, and connecting
with your environment, not trying to escape it. And of course escapism
is what we all want and desire, that experience of non being. And we
get it from the internet or from drugs or whatever it is, but it's the
booby prize. Because ultimately it takes you further and further away
from your immediate environment, which is where we really have to
connect to get that sense of grounded-ness and authenticity, and like
of being in our own lives. Well I think the unit of the day is
something that comes up again and again, in my discussions with
colleagues who are extremely successful, and who also have balanced
lives. Right. This actually came up in the discussion with Karl
Deisseroth, who is also a successful scientist and clinician and, you
know, manages a family, et cetera. So the unit of the day, I think, is
fundamental. And those stack up, as you mentioned. So along those
lines, I've heard you say that in order to reset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=3005"&gt;How to Break an Addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the dopamine system, essentially in order to break an addictive
pattern, to become un-addicted, 30 days of zero interaction with that
substance, that person, et cetera. Right. - Is that correct? Yeah, and
30 days is, in my clinical experience, the average amount of time it
takes for the brain to reset reward pathways for dopamine transmission
to regenerate itself. There's also a little bit of science that
suggests that that's true. Some imaging studies showing that our
brains are still in a dopamine-deficit state two weeks after we've
been using our drug. And then a study by Schukit and Brown which took
a group of depressed men who also were addicted to alcohol, put them
in a hospital where they, they received no treatment for depression
but they had no access to alcohol in that time. And after four weeks,
80% of them no longer met criteria for major depression. So again,
this idea that by depriving ourselves of this high dopamine high
reward substance or behavior, we allow our brains to regenerate its
own dopamine, for the balance to really equilibrate. And then we're in
a place where we can sort of enjoy other things. So that progressive
narrowing Right. - of what brings one pleasure, eventually expands. So
I'd like to dissect out that 30 days a little more finely. And I also
want to address how does one stop doing something for 30 days, if the
thing is a thought? So we'll kind of, I'll put that on the shelf for
the moment. So days one through 10, I would imagine will be very
uncomfortable. [Anna] Yes. They're going to suck basically, to be
quite honest, because the way you described this pleasure pain
balance, to my mind says that if you remove what little pleasure one
is getting, or a lot of pleasure from engaging in some behavior,
that's gone. The pain system is really ramped up. And nothing is
making me feel good. I'll just use myself as an example. I'm not in
recovery but, you know, that 10 days is going to be miserable.
Anxiety, trouble sleeping, physical agitation. Yes. - To the point
where, you know, maybe impulsive, angry. Should one expect all of
that? Should the family members of people expect all of that? Yeah. So
what I say to patients, and it's a really important piece of this
intervention, is that you will feel worse before you feel better. For
how long, is probably the first question they ask, right? - Yes. And I
say usually, in my clinical experience, you'll feel worse for two
weeks, but if you can make it through those first two weeks, the sun
will start to come out in week three. And by week four, most people
are feeling a whole lot better than they were before they stopped
using their substance. So yeah, you have to, it's a hard thing. Like
you have to sign up for it. And I will say, obviously there are people
with addictions that are so severe that as long as they have access to
their drug or behavior, they're not able to stop themselves. And
that's why we have, you know, higher levels of care, Sure. residential
treatment. So this is not going to be for everybody, this
intervention, but it's amazing how many people with really severe
addictions to things like heroin, cocaine, you know, very severe
pornography addictions. I posit this, I do it as an experiment. I said
you know what, let's try this experiment. I'm always amazed, number
one, how many of them are willing. And number two, how many of them
are actually able to do it. They are able to do it. And so that little
nudge is sort of just what they need, And the carrot is, you know,
there's a better life out there for you and you'll be able to taste it
in a month. You really will be able to begin to see that you can feel
better, and that there's another way. So the way you describe it seems
like it's hard, but it's doable for most people, not everybody. -
Yeah, right. And we'll return to that category of people who can't do
that on their own. Well, then days 21 through 30, people are feeling
better. The sun is starting to come out, as you mentioned, which
translates in the narrative we've created here, and supported by
biology, that dopamine is starting to be released in response to the
taste of a really good cup of coffee, Yes, exactly. - for instance.
Whereas before it was only to insert, you know, addictive behavior.
Right, that's right. - Whichever it happens to be. Of course, coffee
can be addictive too, but we'll leave that aside. - Sure, yeah. I feel
like coffee has a kind of consumption limiting mechanism built-in,
where at some point you just can't ingest anymore. Yeah. - But maybe
that's wrong. Sorry to give lift to the caffeine addicts out there. As
I clutch my mug. So days 21 through 30. I've seen a lot of people go
through addiction and addiction treatment. I've spent a lot of time in
those places, actually, looking at it, researching. I've got friends
in that community. I'm close with that community. One thing I've seen
over and over again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=3325"&gt;Relapse, Craving &amp;amp; Triggers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sadly often in the same individuals, is they get sober from whatever,
they're doing great. These are people with families. These are people
that you discard your normal image of an addict and insert the most
normal, typical, whatever, healthy person you can imagine. 'Cause a
lot of these people you wouldn't know were addicts. And then all of a
sudden you get this call, so-and-so's back in jail. So-and-so's wife
is going to leave him because he drank two bottles of wine and took a
Xanax at 7:00 a.m., crashed his truck into a pole, has got two
beautiful kids. Like how did this happen again? To the point where by
the fourth and fifth time, people are just done. I mean maybe people,
you might be able to detect the frustration in my voice. I'm dealing
with this, with somebody that's like, I don't even know that I want to
help this time. It's been so many times, to the point where I'm
starting to wonder is this person just an addict. This is just kind of
what they do and who they are. And you never want to give up on people
but, and I'm hanging in there for them. But I will say that many
people have given up on them. And so what I'd like to talk about in
this context is what sorts of things help other people that we know
that are addicted? What really helps? Not what could help, but what
really helps. And are there certain people for whom it's hopeless? I
mean, I don't like to hold the conversation that way, but I wouldn't
be close to the real life data if I didn't ask. Is it hopeless, are
there people who just will not be able to quit their substance use or
their addictive behavior, despite, I have to assume, really wanting
to? Yeah, so there are people who will die of their disease of
addiction, you know, and I think conceptualizing it as a disease is a
helpful frame. There are other frames that we could use, but I do
think, given the brain physiologic changes that occur with sustained
heavy drug use, and what we know happens to the brain, it is really
reasonable to think of it as a brain disease. And for me, the real
window of, let's say being able to access my compassion around people
who are repeat relapsers, even when their life is so much better when
they're in recovery. - Oh yeah, yeah. It's like a no-brainer, right?
Is to conceptualize this balance and the dopamine deficit state, and a
balance tilted to the side of pain. And to imagine that for some
people, after a month or six months, or maybe even six years, their
balance is still tipped to the side of pain. That on some level that
balance has lost its resilience and its ability to restore
homeostasis. It's almost like the hinge on that balance Yes. - is
messed up. Exactly. And so, I mean, for someone who's never
experienced addiction, like yourself, maybe one way to conceptualize
it is. Well I didn't say that. [Anna] Oh okay. To be clear, I was not
referring to myself, but I, in this example I was giving, if I were, I
would come clean. I would reveal that. But I think that, especially
after hearing some of your lectures and descriptions of the range of
things that are addictive, I think I've been fortunate I don't have a
propensity for drugs or alcohol. Right, okay. I'm lucky in that way. -
Right, right. Frankly, if they remove all the alcohol from the planet,
I'll just be relieved because no one will offer it to me any more.
[Anna] Right, right. So don't send me any alcohol. It won't go to me.
[Anna] Right. But I don't have that, I like to think I have the
compassion, but I don't that empathy for, you know, taking a really
good situation, and what from the outside looks to be Right, right. -
throwing it in the trash. Yeah, so okay, so let me, and this is
really, I think, important because I also had to come to an
understanding of this, and I feel that I have in my 20 years of seeing
these patients. And of course addiction is a spectrum disease, Sure. -
right, and so you've got the severe end of things. Imagine that you
had an itch somewhere on your body, okay. And it was, I mean, we've
all had that, like, you know, whatever the source, it was super, super
itchy. You can go for, you know, if you really focus, you could go for
a pretty good amount of time not scratching it, but the moment you
stopped focusing on not scratching it, you would scratch it. And maybe
you'd do it while you were asleep, right. And that is what happens to
people with severe addiction. That balance is essentially broken.
Homeostasis does not get restored, despite sustained abstinence.
They're living with that constant specter of that pull. It never goes
away. So let me say, there are lots of people with addiction for whom
that does go away. And it goes away at four weeks for many of them.
But in severe cases, that's always there and it's lingering, and it's
the moment when they're not focusing on not using, it's like a reflex.
They fall back into it. It's not purposeful. It's not because they
want to get high. It's not because they value using drugs more than
they do their family. None of that. It's that really they cannot not
do it when given the opportunity, and that moment when they're not
thinking about it. Does that make sense? That's a great description
and actually in that description I can feel a bit of empathy, because
the way you described scratching an itch in your sleep. Yeah. - You
know, I've done that with mosquito bites and some of them, Right. -
you're scratching, you know, like you wake up scratching that mosquito
bite. And I also have to admit that I've experienced not feeling like
I want to pick up my phone because it's so rewarding, but just finding
myself doing it. Yes, of course, yes. - Like I'm not going to use this
thing, I'm not going to use this thing, and then just finding myself
doing it, like what am I doing here? - Yes, right, right. Sort of the
how did I get back here again? - Yes, right. And I know enough about
brain function to understand that we have circuits that generate
deliberate behavior. And we have circuits that generate reflexive
behavior. And one of the goals of the nervous system is to make the
deliberate stuff reflexive, so you don't have to make the decision,
because decision-making is a very costly thing to do. Exactly.
Decision-making of any kind. [Anna] Right, right. So that does really
help. I want to just try and weave together this dopamine puzzle,
however, because if by week, so first phase of this 30 or 40 day
detox, it's like a dopamine fast, Right. - right, okay. First 10 days
are miserable. Middle 10 days, the clouds are out, there may be some
shards of sunlight coming through. And then all of a sudden sun starts
to come out, it gets brighter and brighter. Why is it then that people
will relapse, not just after getting fired from a job or their spouse
leaving them, but when things are going really well? Yes. - Is it this
unconscious mechanism? 'Cause I've seen this before. They have a great
win, I have a friend who's a really impressive creative. I don't want
to reveal any more than that. And relapsed upon getting another really
terrific opportunity to create for the entire world. And I was like
how can that happen? But now I'm beginning to wonder, was it the
dopamine associated with that win that opened the spigot on his
dopamine system? Because it happened in a phase of a really great
stretch of life. Yeah, right. Yeah, so you raise that great point
about triggers, right? And triggers are things that make us want to go
back to using our drug. And the key thing about triggers, whatever
they are, is they also release a little bit of dopamine, right? So
just thinking about whatever the trigger is that we associate with
drug use, or just thinking about drug use, can already release this
anticipatory dopamine, this new little mini spike. But here's the part
that I think is really fascinating. That mini spike is followed by a
mini deficit state. So it goes up and then it doesn't go back down to
baseline, it goes below baseline tonic levels. And that's craving,
right? So that anticipation is immediately followed by wanting the
drug. And it's that dopamine deficit state that drives the motivation
to go and get the drug. So many people talk about dopamine as not
really about pleasure, but about wanting and about motivation. And so
it is that deficit state that then drives the locomotion to get it.
And earlier your description of dopamine being involved in the desire
for more, giving the sense of reward, but also movement. Right. - I
have to assume that those things are braided together Yes, yes. - in
our nervous system, for the specific intention of when you feel
something good, then you feel the pain. Yes. - But maybe you don't
notice it. And then the next thing you know, you're pursuing more of
the thing that And I love the way you use the word braided together,
that's beautiful. And let me also just say, something that I find also
fascinating in my work with patients, and I see this all the time.
There are people for whom bad life experiences, loss, you know, in any
form, stress, in many different forms, that's a trigger, but there are
absolutely people for whom the trigger is things going well. And the
things going well can be like the reward of the things going well, but
very often what it is is the removal of the hypervigilant state that's
required to keep their use in check. So it's the sense of I want to
celebrate, you know, or I want to, this reward happened, I want to put
more reward on there. And it's really really fascinating because when
people come to that realization about themselves, that they're most
vulnerable when things are going well, that's really a valuable
insight because then they can put some things in place or barriers in
place or go to more meetings or whatever it is that they do, you know,
to protect themselves. Along those lines, I have a friend 40 years
sober, was a severe drug and alcohol addict from a very young age.
Really impressive person, does a lot of important work in the kind of
at-risk youth community out in Hawaii. And he said something to me, he
said, as former addicts often do, they've got these great sayings. But
I think it fits very well with what you're describing. He said, you
know, no matter how far you drive, you're always the same distance
from the ditch. And I said well that's kind of depressing, and he said
no, that's actually what gives me peace. Yeah. Because what would
happen is for so many years of relapsing and relapsing, recovering and
relapsing, he felt like it was hopeless. And then somehow
conceptualizing that the vigilance can never go away, instead of
making him feel burdened, Yeah. - it made him feel relieved. So I
often think about that statement, you know, no matter how far you
drive, you're always the same distance from the ditch, because in my
mind I conceptualize that as gosh, that's a tough way to drive down
the road. But actually, on a road where you know where the ditch is
and where you know where the lanes lines are, it's actually a pretty
nice drive. It's when you don't know where the shoulder is, that you
constantly have to be looking around. So there's this, we're speaking
now in analogies and imagery and science. But I, one of the things I
find so incredible about this community of 12-step, and there are a
variety of them, are the communities that they create for themselves,
and some of these sayings, which I do believe link back to really core
biological mechanisms. Yes, yes. I do want to ask about those
communities. I have a question which might be a little bit
controversial. Great! Which is, is it possible that people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=4060"&gt;Can People Get Addicted To “Sobriety”?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who were addicted to drugs or alcohol or gambling, or some other
behavior, get addicted to the addiction community? Because one thing
that I think I observe over and over is that there's some circuit in
the brain of human beings that has to tell you about the dream they
had the night before, for whatever reason. There's another circuit
that leads people to wake you up, if they themselves can't sleep. I
don't know what circuit it is. I'm being facetious here. But there
does seem to also be a circuit in the brain of addicts to discuss and
want to kind of talk about their recovery a lot. And I mention this
not to poke at them, but rather the opposite, because I think that one
thing that is challenging, at least for me, and having friends that
have a propensity for drug or alcohol addiction, not all of them, but
certainly some of them, is when they're talking about their recovery,
I feel like it's all they talk about. This meeting, that meeting, that
meeting. So what I'm really asking here is that, can we become
addicted to sobriety? Right. So this is a great question and it links
into some of the other things we've been talking about, having to do
with where do we settle out, you know? What is the way to live between
pleasure and pain? And I implied earlier that ultimately we want a
resilient balance that's sensitive to pleasure and pain, but that can
easily restore homeostasis after we indulge, even when we indulge
greatly. But the truth of the matter is that people with severe
addiction, I believe temperamentally want those extremes, and they're
wired for that kind of intensity that is more than just these slight
adjustments around the fulcrum, right? It's like they want the big
highs and the big lows. They'll say great meeting. Yeah, right, right.
- They're like that was such an amazing meeting. Or they find a group,
- Right, yeah. They find a group in a location. Yeah. This is almost
an inside joke in those communities. Again, I'm not reporting, I'm not
talking about a friend in quotes, this isn't me reporting. They'll
talk about how attractive people are at a given meeting, or how bonded
they feel to people at a given meeting. - Right, right. That the
meetings themselves Right. - become their own form of dopamine hit.
Yes, yes, yes. And again, I'm not being disparaging, I just, I want to
understand this. Right, so yes, so a lot of times patients will say to
me, oh, you know, I don't want to go to AA. It's a cult. And my
response to that is because it's a cult is exactly why it works, okay.
Because yes, it is much better for you to be addicted to AA and to
recovery, than almost any other addiction I could think of. And we
know from Rob Malenka's work, who's here at Stanford, that oxytocin,
you know, is the hormone that's involved in human pair bonding and
relationships and love. And it directly links to dopamine neurons and
causes the release of dopamine. So yes, when we connect with other
humans, especially in a kind of transcendent spiritual way, that's a
huge dopamine hit. And it does replace the dopamine that people get
from drugs. And for people who have this addiction temperament, they
need it on a more intense level. They're not going to be generally
satisfied with kind of, you know, a sort of acquaintanceship, right?
They want that intensity of the intimacy that you get with people when
you're cathartically exposing, you know, warts and all. So yes, people
can get addicted to recovery, and good for them. Go for it, you know.
And of course this can be disruptive for friendships and
relationships, where the one person is not in recovery. Like you're
going to so many meetings, you're always talking about recovery, but
you know what, much better than them being intoxicated, right? I mean,
so although you may tire of your friends talking about their meetings
all the time, I'm sure you would rather have them do that than, you
know, be in their addictions. Absolutely. And this is now the second
time you've done this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=4305"&gt;Are We All Wired for Addiction?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;through this discussion, but now I have empathy because the way you
describe their enthusiasm about meetings, Yes. - is probably the way
that people feel about me and work. - Yes, right. In neuroscience. -
Yes. I mean, I've been getting up in front of the class since I was
eight years old and talking about things I read over the weekend. Now
I just happen to have this thing called a podcast. Right. I've been
doing it since I was a little. And it annoys a lot of people, right.
I've learned to suppress it a little bit. Some people like it, but I'm
poking fun at myself just to say that I now can understand that the
way I feel about the reports about yet another amazing meeting or, or
for there's a different form of this. But there's some people for
which they just love intense experiences. Yes. - They're always like
trying to pull me off to Bali because they're talking about how
sensual it is all the time, I'm sure Bali's wonderful. But there's
this kind of ratcheting up, it's like seeking Burning Man all year
long. - Right. I've never been to Burning Man, no desire to go to
Burning Man. But inside of academia I mean if I were to just turn the
mirror at myself, inside of academia, or here in Silicon Valley, work,
and the - Right. pursuit of more success, even if money is kind of
divorced from that, sometimes it is sometimes it isn't. Academic work
is, you know, for sake of pursuit of knowledge. It sounds to me like
the same mechanism. In fact, it feels to me very much like the same
mechanism. So Andrew, here's what I love about you. First of all,
you're willing to bring your own flaws and foibles to this
conversation. Well they're everywhere. Well, you know what, it's
wonderful. And then you're really open and curious and wanting to
understand, 'cause I can't tell you how many people I have met who
really see addiction as some kind of otherness. But the truth is we're
all wired for addiction. And if you're not addicted yet it's just,
it's right around the corner. Do you know what I mean? Especially with
the incredible panoply of new drugs and behaviors that are out there.
So I love that you're willing to take a moment and really try to
understand this, because it is, we can all relate, and you're relating
it to your, essentially your work addiction is right and apt. You just
happen to be addicted to something that is really socially rewarded.
You know, you figured that out at an early age. Oh, when I do X, Y and
Z, all these people go look at that smart kid, or whatever it is, you
know. Well for me, it made me feel safe. Okay. I felt like. Yeah, I
just felt like this, and I pause there 'cause it's like, it's like
peace. I'm like ah, I can relax for a moment. When you're talking
about neuroscience? Or just when I feel like I'm on the right path.
Yeah, okay. - And I'm onto something. Or if I see something that I'm
excited about, Right. I'm like, I feel filled with, it must be
dopamine. Yes. - I feel flooded with pleasure, literally from head to
toe. - Right, yeah. And then my next thought is more. [laughing] So
true, you're a true addict. Okay, thank you. - You are. You are. But
you just got really, - I think thank you. you really got lucky with
the fact that what you're drawn to is adaptive, essentially, you know.
And then your challenge is going to be that your life doesn't get too
out of balance in the sense that you're 24/7 working, you don't stop
and do some other things or think of And my life, admittedly, is
somewhat asymmetric. I mean it has other components of physical
health, et cetera, but it is somewhat asymmetric. Which is why I got a
dog. Although I talk about him an awful lot, so. But the dog is good
because that draws you out of yourself and a little bit away from the
work. But again, you know, I think the key here is for people who feel
like they don't, they've never experienced addiction or they don't
know anybody with addiction, or if they do, they don't get it, just
think of that one thing that is the most important thing in your life
that you do, that gives you pleasure and meaning and purpose. And then
imagine if you couldn't do it. Oh yeah, let's not talk about that.
[Anna] Right. Well I appreciate the feedback and you can send me a
bill at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=4557"&gt;Bizarre Addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the most ridiculous sounding addiction that you've ever
witnessed, that was actually a real addiction, along these lines.
Because I think we all know the standard heroin, pill. You've been
very, I should mention, because it's important, your previous book,
and we will provide a link to that as well, focused on the opioid
crisis and what we thought was medication. It turned out to be just as
bad, if not worse, than a lot of so-called street drugs. So we
understand those, you know, gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction.
Now video games. We'll talk about social media a little bit more in
depth. But what's the most like, wow, I didn't realize people could
get addicted to that? Water. Really? Really. So I had a very lovely
patient who was, had a severe alcohol addiction, and she got into
recovery from her alcohol addiction for many years. But she kind of
had a sort of a polydipsia, or an urge to be drinking something a lot.
And so she drank a lot of water and slowly, over time, she realized
that if she drank enough water, she could become hyponatremic and
delirious and be out of herself. You can die from it, right? Right,
which is, she just wanted to be out of her own head. And so she would
periodically intentionally overdose on water, in order, you know, to,
I know, it was so sad, so sad. What happened to her? She eventually
took her own life. Wow. - Yeah, it was really. That's rough. - She was
a lovely woman. She was so bright. She had so many interests and
passions, and of course it was very sad when, you know, when she died.
But that was a wow to me, it was like wow, if you have this disease of
addiction, you can even get addicted to water. Wow. And I think it
just underscores the generalizability of the circuits. Right. There
isn't a brain circuit for addiction to water that she happened to
have. There's a brain circuit for pleasure and pain and addiction, and
water plugged into that circuit. - Right, right. Wow. That's intense.
In your book, "Dopamine Nation",&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=4694"&gt;Recovered Addicts Are Heroes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you also describe some amazing paths to recovery. People that, you
know, from reading it I would, I won't say which ones and who 'cause
there are some great surprises in the book too, both tragic and
triumphant, as they say. You've often described your patients as your
heroes. Yeah. - Yeah, tell us a little bit more about that. You know,
when you think about how hard it is to give up a drug or a behavior
that you're addicted to, how much courage that takes and fortitude and
discipline, and stick to it-ness, these people are really amazing
people. I mean that's, I don't know that I could do it, what they do,
you know. And like, you know, we talked a little bit about just the
constant ever-present urge to use, even after sustained periods of
abstinence for some people. That's really really hard. And of course
then you double down on the shame that they feel, because of that
urge, even when their lives are so much better. I mean these people
are really, really remarkable. And you take their remarkable
accomplishment and then you imagine the world that we live in now,
where we are constantly invited and tempted and really bombarded with
opportunities to become addicted It's like feeling an itch everywhere.
Oh yeah, I mean you can't escape it. You know, you cannot escape it.
That you'll get an email in your inbox inviting you to do X, Y, or Z.
And if you're addicted to that thing, you know, you try to like delete
all your apps and not go here. All of a sudden your work inbox, you
know, you're getting those images, let's say. Really, really, really
hard. And yet these people find a way to do it. I think it's
absolutely amazing. And they're really wise people. They have so much
wisdom to offer. They've taught me a lot. You know, as I talk about in
my book I have my own addictions, and I really just like took a page
right out of their, I was okay, what do I do now? All right, what did
this patient do, what did that, okay, I'm going to try that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=4810"&gt;Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt &amp;amp; Shame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an amazing community Yeah. - of people, they are very sage. I
wanted to just touch on something that you mentioned, which is the
shame. Yeah. You know you can't go to a meeting, or talk to addicts,
without detecting or hearing about like lies, shame, et cetera. I
heard you say in an interview with somebody else recently that truth-
telling and secrets are sort of at the core of recovery. And yeah,
tell us more about that. Yeah. So one of the things that I found
really fascinating about working with people in recovery, was how
telling the truth, even about the merest detail of their lives, was
central to their recovery. And I became really curious about that.
Like why would truth-telling be so important? And of course there is
the obvious thing that when people are in their addiction, they're
lying about using, you know. So part of getting into recovery is to
stop lying to the people they care about, about their use. But it's
really more than that because what people in recovery have taught me
is that it's not even just not lying about using drugs. I have to not
lie about anything. I can't lie about why I was late to work this
morning, which we all do all. Oh I hit traffic, no I didn't hit
traffic, I wanted to spend two more minutes reading the paper and
drinking my coffee, right. Or just lying about, you know, I don't know
where I had dinner. Like, so people with addiction will get into, you
know, the lying habit where they're lying about random stuff, 'cause
they're sort of in the habit of lying. And how recovery is really
about telling the truth, you know, in all ways. And so one of the
things that I, I had a lot of fun with in writing the book, is sort of
exploring the neuroscience around why truth-telling is important to
leading a balanced life. And we know like every religion, since the
beginning of time, is all about telling the truth. Well why, right?
And there's really interesting neuroscience behind it that suggests
that when we tell the truth, we actually potentially strengthen our
prefrontal cortical circuits, and their connections to our limbic
brain and our reward brain. And of course, these are the circuits that
get disconnected when we're in our addiction, right? Our balance, in
our reward pathway, our limbic brain, our emotion brain, is doing one
thing, and our cortical circuits are completely disengaged from that,
ignoring what's happening, which is easy to do because it's reflexive.
We don't need to think about that balance for the balance to be
happening. But we have to re-engage those circuits, anticipate future
consequences, think through the drink, you know, not just how am I
going to feel now if I use, but how am I going to feel tomorrow or six
months from now? And that telling the truth is in fact a way to do
that, to make these connections stronger. And there I talk about some
studies in my book that kind of indirectly show that. So I find that
really fascinating, plus just that like being open and honest with
people really does create very intimate connections, and those
intimate connections create dopamine. So we were talking a little bit
about how you know a bunch of people who need like intensity in their
lives. For me, I need a lot of intensity in my human connections. Like
I'm really not interested in, and bored by and made anxious by, casual
interactions. But you know, like having this kind of discussion with
you, that's very intense and also intimate and self-disclosing, is
very rewarding for me. So that's an important source of dopamine.
Thank God I became a psychiatrist. Yeah, absolutely. Like I can't
disclose all my stuff, but I am quite transparent with my patients,
which is a slightly unorthodox. But, you know, when I think it's
right, I'm also transparent with them. So that's, you know, that's a
source of dopamine too, when we're honest and we disclose. You think
people are going to run away from you, if you tell them about all like
your weird neuroses, but really they don't. What they're like is oh
thank God, I'm not the only one, right. What I love about, I love many
things about your book. I read it in one sweep. Oh thank you. And I
was like wow. I was pleasantly surprised, but I was like wow, she's
really opening up in this book, from the very beginning. And I don't
want to give it away, but it's yeah, you're very open where it's
appropriate. And also I think that this question about truth-telling,
I always think about like tell the truth, be a hundred percent about
the truth, but there's also this element about do you report previous
lies, right? What about prior behavior? And I'm fascinated by this
'cause to me telling the truth has many facets, but the three sides of
this thing in my mind, are one is reporting everything accurately. The
other is what do you withhold, what do you not withhold, right?
Because some people say tell the truth, or at least don't lie. That's
sort of a Lies of omission, right. Yeah, so lies of omission. Lies of
omission. And then there's the, what I have to assume for most people,
is a small to enormous batch of things that they lied about in the
past, that still thread into the future. Right. So how important is it
for the addict, or every person really, to, 'cause it sounds like
cultivating the circuitry between prefrontal cortex and the dopamine
system would be great for anybody. Since we're all addicts, Right. -
everyone should do it. But in all seriousness, it sounds like a good
thing for everybody to do. How much work needs to be done on all the
priors, all the stuff we've hidden? I mean not me, but all the stuff
that everybody else has hidden. Yeah, so the, you know, the steps of
the 12-steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, a good number of those steps are
about that very thing. The past, the ways that we've harmed people in
the past. And the fourth step is about making amends, you know, by
admitting the ways in which that we've contributed to harming others.
And it is a really big piece of recovery. So, you know, how important,
so for people with addiction, it's really, really important to go back
and make amends. And, you know, the key idea there is you just go back
and you apologize, you know, and you don't have to get any particular
kind of response, or you don't need to be forgiven. It's the act
itself of apologizing about the ways in which we've harmed or lied to
people in the past, that is cathartic and renewing, and allows us to
kind of shed this skin and be new in our lives and begin again. Sort
of absolved, you know, of past sins, so to speak. So it is really
important. You know, are there situations when it's maybe not a good
idea, because of that person or the nature? Sure, you know, there are
always going to be, it doesn't have to be like, it's not, we're
talking about not like Kant's idea about I'd never lie, robbers in
your house. You're a stowaway. You can't lie even about that. It's
like no, there are probably situations where, Absolutely. - you know.
For sake of other people's safety, Right, and- - children's safety,
sure. Right, I mean there are, you can think of a million scenarios.
But in general, you know, when we're taking stock, because I don't
know about you, but I have a lot of regrets and guilt about a lot of
things in my life. And they kind of haunt me, you know. It means I'll
have nightmares, right. And I think that's true for most people. I
mean I occasionally will meet somebody who's like I don't have any
regrets in my life, I'm like wow. Like I cannot relate to that at all.
So, you know, this idea of like catharsis and, well, I mean, in the
12-steps it's telling God, or your higher power, telling another human
being, the ways in which you've wronged others. Considering your own
character defects and how those have contributed. To me, that's a
really important piece and something that we don't do enough in our
current culture. Especially in psychiatry, frankly, where there's like
a lot of eternally empathizing with patients, but not a whole lot of
likes going well, you know, actually you kind of messed that up. Or
like that was really bad on you, you know. And in my work, I don't
necessarily use that language, but, you know, patients might say like
I really feel badly about, you know, this thing. I'll be like yeah, I
get it. I understand that you feel. Well guilt is a [Anna] Right.
There's a circuit for that too. Right, and it's important, right, and
it's also important to recovery and to not becoming addicted.
Experiencing a certain amount of appropriate shame for things that we
have done and, you know, feeling the pain that comes with shame, which
is an incredibly painful emotion, right. And I think that may be the
one that we all try to avoid more than any other, is like that shame
of not being liked or not being accepted or not being celebrated. - Or
the thing that we did is really despicable. Right, it's really, yeah,
like oh my God, I did that horrible thing, right, right. So, I mean,
I've done horrible things that I haven't gone back and said I did this
horrible thing, but I'm, maybe I've tried to pay it forward. Like I've
told my kids, you know, when I was younger I did this horrible thing
and it still haunts me. So if you're ever tempted to do something like
what I did, you might think about my situation. So, you know, some
kind of way. But I think wrestling with that is important. I think
it's a really important element to all this, and there's not, I love
that there's neuroscience being done on truth-telling, Yeah. - and the
value of truth-telling. Yeah. - I think, if I were to predict a new
and truly exciting area that people are going to be really curious
about, in this huge sphere we call neuroscience, I hope they'll
continue to do more work. Also, I'm so glad to hear that's happening
here at Stanford. No that's, the literature that I look at isn't
Stanford work, but there's work. Great. - It might be people at
Stanford. - Great, regardless of where it's happening. More of that
and all the rest please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=5440"&gt;Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin &amp;amp; MDMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to ask you about using drugs to treat drug addiction. These
days there's a growing interest, or at least discussion about
ibogaine. People going down, going out of country, because I think
it's still illegal here, or is illegal here, going out of country to,
I dunno, either inject it or smoke it or whatever it is. Or people
going and doing Ayahuasca journeys or MDMA, which is still an illegal
drug in this country, but there are clinical trials. There are people
on this campus doing experimental studies. I don't know of clinical
trials, but at Johns Hopkins there are clinical trials, et cetera. So
this is a vast area, right? Different chemistries for different drugs
and different purposes. But the rationale, as I understand it, is take
people who are in a pattern of addiction, launch them into a
experience that's also chemical and extreme, often of the extreme
serotonin and or extreme dopamine type. So MDMA, - Right. ecstasy for
instance. Tons of serotonin dumped, tons of dopamine dumped. How
neurotoxic, if neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not a
topic for now. But a lot. And then somehow that extreme experience
wrapped inside of a supported network in there, whether or not there's
just someone there or whether or not they're actively working through
something with the patient, is supposed to eject the person into a
life where drug use isn't as much of interest. This violates, at a
purely rational level, this violates everything we've talked about in
terms of dopamine biology. It would, if this arrangement is the way I
described it, cause more addiction, is anything but a dopamine fast,
it's a dopamine feast. So we hear about successful transitions through
this, at least anecdotally, and maybe some clinical studies. What is
going on? What is going on? It doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah.
Yeah, so I think it's good that you're skeptical. I think we all
should be skeptical. Having said that, there are clinical studies
showing, you know, and these are small studies and they're short
duration, small number of subjects, but, you know, taking people for
example, who are addicted to alcohol, and then having them have this,
let's say a psychedelic experience in a very controlled setting. So
either, typically it's a high dose psilocybin, or three dose, as I saw
it for the MAP study of MDMA. Right. - Of ecstasy. Those are sort of
the, seem to be the kind of, Yes, the typical, right. - the kind of
bread and butter of this kind of work. - Right, right. But the thing
to really keep in mind is that this is completely interwoven with
regular psychotherapy, and that these are highly selected individuals.
In clinical trials. Right, right. And these are clinical- - we're
referring to legal clinical trials. Right, right. And so, you know, I
think the metaphor that helps me think about this is there are many
ways to the top of the mountain, and these are sort of like taking the
gondola instead of walking up. It sort of, instead of doing like a
year of psychoanalysis where you're sitting on the couch every week
reflecting on your life, it's a condensed version of psychoanalysis or
psychotherapy, plus, you know, MDMA, which gets you there faster. And
creates the intimacy, presumably, because of the Well I think the main
thing that happens when it's beneficial, is it just allows the person
to get outside of their own head and look at their lives on a much
broader sweep, and to consider themselves not mired in the quotidian
sort of details of their life, but rather as a human on the large
planet Earth, in the vast universe. So I think it takes, it's like
when it works, it's a transformational experience because it gives the
person another lens through which to view their lives, which I think
for some people is positive and powerful, because they can come back
from that and be like oh my gosh, I care about my family, and I don't,
I want X, Y, or Z for them. And I realize that my continuing to drink
is not going to, you know, achieve that. So it's almost like a
spiritual or values-based. So I think it can be very powerful, but
having said that, I truly am quite skeptical because, you know,
addiction is a chronic relapsing and remitting problem. It's hard for
me to imagine that there's something that works very quickly short-
term, that's going to work for a disease that's really long-lasting.
Yeah, the two addicts I know that did MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as
part of this thing, both got worse. Yeah. But the people I know who
had severe trauma who did this, who took this approach, seem to be
doing better. Okay, interesting. - And so I, I think that the
discussion, as we hear it now, is just sort of psychedelics, which is
a huge category that includes many different drugs and compounds with
different effects. And we hear about trauma and addiction lumped
together. And I think that I'm a splitter, not a lumper, as we say in
science. And I think it's going to be important for people to know
that this is definitely not a one-size fits all kind of thing. But it
sounds like it may have some utility under certain conditions. Yeah, I
think so. I'm trying to be very open-minded about its potential
utility for certain individuals. But I can tell you in my clinical
work, what is a very concerning unintended consequence of this
narrative, is I have a lot of people who are looking for some kind of
spiritual awakening who on their own, not in the context of any kind
of therapeutic, psychological work, you know, microdose or want to try
psilocybin or MDMA with a friend or wherever, so they can have this
spiritual experience that they can figure out their lives. That's a
disaster and almost never works out well. And I've then had people who
literally, supposedly you can't get addicted to psychedelics because,
you know, something with the biochemistry which I don't fully
understand, 'cause it doesn't make any sense to me. But I have
patients clinically who definitely are addicted to, you know, MDMA, to
micro-dosing. So that's very concerning to me 'cause like, you know,
Pollan's "How to Change Your Mind", I respect that work, but on the
other hand, it's penetrated the culture- - Michael Pollan's book.
[Anna] Yeah, yeah. And I don't know him and so I don't have a problem
taking a stance. So I'll just say my stance on that is the narrative
of popular authors can expand and wick out so fast, Yes. that pretty
soon people are essentially taking their mental health into their own
hands. And I actually, I have great optimism for this business of
clinical use of psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew Johnson at Johns
Hopkins is doing fabulous work on this. And there are others too, of
course. But those are controlled settings. Right. And the pharmacology
is being tuned up. And one thing that I think is coming. There are
several papers published recently in great journals like nature and
science, et cetera, where there are scientists who are removing the
hallucinogenic components of these drugs and finding that they still
have the antidepressant effects. Interesting. - And so the experience
of a psychedelic, and the long-term effects of the psychedelic, might
actually be dissociable. And so, again I, and I'm always careful to
say I'm neither for something or against it. I just think that
treading carefully is what's important. I agree with you, and I can
just tell you that the downstream effect for the average person, many
of whom present in our clinic, is that they've misconstrued the data
on the use of psychedelics for mental health conditions, to this idea
that they're safe, or that anybody can take them in any circumstance
and have this kind of awakening. And that's not what the data show,
right? The data are these highly controlled settings, you know,
carefully selected patients. So that's my worry, you know. Sure. And
I'm going to be sitting down with Matthew Johnson at some point, and
we'll discuss this. And I think that, ah, that care and that cocoon of
real clinical care, does seem to be an important component. - Yes.
Well I'm glad we could touch on it and, you know, I'm sure I'll get a
bunch of comments telling me that, you know. But I think it is
important to explore things from all sides, and that's what we do, as
scientists. - Yes. And if Michael Pollan wants to chat, we can do that
too. That's fine. I very much enjoyed the book actually. - Yes, yes.
But I think that people run with ideas. That's right. They don't walk
with them, they sprint. - That's right, right. Yeah. There are a
couple other things I just want to touch on, but they all relate to
social media. [Anna] Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=6020"&gt;Social Media Addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were featured in "The Social Dilemma". It was a powerful movie. I
think many people avoided seeing that movie because it reflects back
on us just how addicted we all are and how manipulated we all are.
[Anna] Yes. But it doesn't seem to have changed behavior much. I have
to say that the movie changed my understanding and my perception, but
not my behavior too much. If we look at addiction as a maladaptive
thing, something that's making our lives worse or us less functional
at work and in relationships, I could imagine a version of social
media where it's making me more connected. I mean this is a podcast
after all. Yes, yes. - I post videos. This will show up on YouTube and
elements of it on Instagram as well. So much like sugar or other
things, I have to imagine that we need to regulate, not necessarily
eliminate, this behavior. So I want to talk about what that looks
like. And I want to talk about what you've referred to as this
narcissistic preoccupation that social media is creating. That we are
all far more keenly aware of how we look and how we sound and how we
are being perceived, than we were 10 years ago. [Anna] Right. So first
of all, social media, how addicting is it really? And what is healthy
social media behavior? So the first message I would want to get across
about social media, is that it really is a drug and it's engineered to
be a drug. And it's based on, you know, potency, quantity, variety,
the bottomless polls, the likes, the way that it's enumerated, all of
that. Which doesn't mean that we can't use it, but we need to be very
thoughtful about the way we use it, just like we need to be thoughtful
about the way we use any drug. And so that means with intention and in
advance, planning our use, right. And trying to use it as a really
awesome tool to potentially connect with other people, and not to be
used by it or get lost in it. And of course, you know, people are
going to come with different propensities for addiction to any drug,
and that's true for social media too. Some people will have no problem
using it in moderation or using it in a way that's adaptive. And other
people will immediately get sucked in. And the key thing about getting
addicted is when it's happening, nobody who's getting addicted thinks
they're getting addicted, right. Let's face it, it's only after the
fact that we go woops, you know, what was that about? Remember texting
and driving, there are all these books about texting and driving, how
terrible it was. Yeah. Even the governments have largely given up. You
see these billboards Terrifying. - like don't text and drive, or any
text can wait, or whatever. Not worth dying for. Right, right. - But
everybody's texting and driving. Right and if you look at young people
today, teenagers, I mean they're basically cybernetically enhanced,
that the phone is there. You know, it's like they're talking to you
and texting 12 friends at the same time, and there's no stopping it. I
mean the genie is out of the bottle where, you know, we're not going
back. [Andrew] Right. So we do need to figure out, you know, how to
make this tool something that's, you know, going to be good for us and
not ultimately harmful. And I don't have all the answers by any
stretch of the imagination, but I do think, you know, some of the
wisdom that we have learned from using other drugs, also applies to
social media. Which is to say that we have to, again, put barriers in
place that allow us to remain in control of our use, which means not
too much, you know, not too often, not too potent. Do you think in,
going back to this idea of the unit of the day being a good
attractable unit, a manageable unit of time for most people, so you're
saying in advance, so allocating two hours in which you're going to
allow yourself to have free reign use of the phone and all its apps
and all its things, or even more restricted than that, meaning okay,
I'm only going to allow myself 30 minutes a day to post and comment,
and then that's a closeout completely. Yeah, so I think it's, it
depends on the person and sort of a combination. We talked earlier
about, you know, having an itch and scratching yourself at night.
We've gotten to a point with smartphones, people are pulling them out
and they are utterly unconscious of doing so, pulling them out, you
know, a couple of texts, a couple. They don't know they're doing it! -
I have a friend who works in, delivers babies, and many pregnant
mothers won't actually deliver without their phone in hand. And this
used to be the hand that was connected to their spouse. This may be a
comment on spouses more than on phones. But it sounds like it's a kind
of a security blanket of sorts. - Right, like a transitional object,
yeah. Actually that reminds me, you've referred to the phone, I think
it's the phone, but maybe it's our online persona or ourselves, as
we've become sort of infantile in our need for, it's like a baby and a
bottle. Right, right. And so I do wonder if we have regressed, and I
do think we've regressed a bit in terms of our online behavior. Our
inability to act like. I always thought an adult was somebody that can
control their behavior. Yeah. - That's the difference between a baby
and an adult. You don't have to be a developmental neurobiologist for
very long to understand that a young organism can't control its
behavior, an older one can. So to me, a mature organism, mature in
years organism that can't control its behavior, is a baby. It's an
immature version of itself. And there's neuroscience to support that
statement. I look at my own behavior with the phone sometimes and I
think, I'm a grown man. Like what is the problem here, right? You
know, I don't eat baby food, but I'm acting like a baby with the
phone, all right, in the sense that I'm reflexively picking it up, I'm
not being intentioned and deliberate with it. Do I need a full 30
days, Anna? So yes, so 30 days away from my phone? As you know, that's
my recommend, the full 30 days to reset. If you're severely addicted,
I recommend the 30 days. But if you're just a little bit addicted,
like most of us, you probably don't need 30 days. In fact, a single
day, not only would be challenging, but probably may be sufficient. My
phone is off for substantial segments of the day. Okay, that's great.
And it drives other people crazy. People expect me to respond. But I
don't care. Yeah, right, right. - I really don't. And I actually take
a little bit of pleasure in the fact that, well, because I think the
point I'm trying to make is the right one, which is that it's not just
right for me, but like why, I don't see a clause on text messages or
emails that say must be responded to within X amount of time or else,
or else. So I take the liberty of replying when I'm able to. Yeah,
that's right. - Or want to. Right, which touches on one of the big
challenges about social media, is that as more and more of us are
spending more and more time on social media, we're divesting our
libidinous energies, et cetera, from real-life interactions. So that
means even when we want to choose to not be online connecting, we go
outside and there's no there there, right. There's nobody else there.
So I think our collective challenge, and it should be our mission, is
to make sure that we are preserving and maintaining offline ways to
connect with each other. 'Cause if we don't do that then we'll be very
lonely, right, if we were not online. But if you have a tribe of folks
that you can be with, none of whom are on their phones while you're
together for that discreet amount of time, then it's wonderful and
liberating and nobody's distracted. And I think that's really the key.
And I think young people are figuring that out, you know. They're
trying to create these spaces or try to, let's say, instead of doing a
dopamine fast by yourself, do it with your friends, right. Then
there's the FOMO is less, the fear of missing out because, oh you're
all doing the dopamine fast together. So these are some of the tricks
that we can come up with. I like that. - Yeah, okay good. - I like
that. I don't allow, I have a home gym and I love working out. I just
enjoy it and always have. And I don't allow my phone in my gym
anymore. Right. And I live in an area where I don't get any reception,
like two meters outside my door. So all my dog walks now are just, and
they were boring as hell. Yes. - I also have a bulldog, he doesn't
like to walk. It's really slow. And it was so boring for a while Yes.
- because I was so used to taking calls while I walk, - Right. and
it's super efficient when I do that. The walks now are some of my
favorite part of the day, Yeah, right. - because, and if the phone, if
I were to get a call on one of those or they brought reception of the
areas, I would be very dismayed. - Yeah, right. So I can attest to
this, and I don't think I'm a phone addict, but I do put work into
regulating my phone behavior. Yeah, so this is the key. You have to,
with intention, prior to being in that situation, think of literal,
physical and metacognitive barriers that you can put between yourself
and your phone, or whatever your drug is, to create these intentional
spaces where you're not constantly interrupting yourself, essentially,
and distracting yourself, because I really do think, you know, I think
we talked just before we started with the interview, you know, we're
losing the ability to have a sustained thought, right? I mean we get
so far and then, then you get to that point in the thought where it's
a little bit hard to know what's coming next. And it's very easy to
check your phone or check your email, or look something up on the
internet. And then you never get that opportunity to finish that
thought, which is really the source of creative energy and an original
thought, right. You're not just reacting to what's coming at you. -
Right, and something that could contribute to the world. That's right.
I'm a big believer that you're either consuming or you are creating.
And there is, I should mention, it's important, I do believe in
neutral time. I think sleep is great. I'm a big proponent of sleep and
I've talked a lot about it on the podcast, I care a lot about sleep.
And not just for sake of performance. I actually just really like
sleep. I think that being a constant consumer of visual information
and information of all kinds, can be a problem. But there's some
really great sources of information on the internet. - Yes. And I
certainly benefit from the fact that those channels exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=6685"&gt;Narcissism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narcissistic pre-occupation. Am I a narcissist? You know, first of
all, there's healthy Or is the fact that I asked, does that take me
out of, would a narcissist never ask that question? Oh yes, a highly
sophisticated narcissist Oh I see. - would know to do that. Well I'm
not very sophisticated. So there's healthy narcissism, which means
that we all invest our personal energies into things that we care
about. And if our competence in that arena is threatened, we would all
experience a narcissistic injury, and that's normal and healthy. But
we are living in a narcissistic culture, I mean that's not news, this
preoccupation with individual achievement and individual self-worth
and individual self-confidence. And I think all of that is just fueled
by social media, where we're not just seeing ourselves, but we're
seeing people's reactions to ourselves, and every single, you know,
thing we say or do, you know, we get likes and this and that. It's
really insidious and it contributes, I think, ultimately to a lot of
personal shame, because we're not really meant to be individuals
bouncing around in the universe. We're social animals. And we're
probably generally happiest, even for natural contrarians among us,
when we're part of a tribe, right. And if we do too much to kind of
separate ourselves from that tribe, I think that the brain's natural
and instinctive corrective mechanism against that is self-loathing and
shame. So, you know, it's so ironic because the culture tells us if we
just achieve more, we'll like ourselves more. But the truth is
actually the opposite. That I think when people get these pinnacles of
personal achievement, you know, you have things like the imposter
syndrome or whatever, you know. Or you just, you know, we're at
Stanford after a lot of high achievers. Right. - Right. Some
phenomenal, amazing people like yourself and other colleagues of mine
that just, I'm always in awe. Like it's just amazing, like the mean is
shifted so high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=6810"&gt;Goal Seeking, Success &amp;amp; Surprise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also people who have amazing paths to get here, coming from very
little and accomplishing so much. But it's also the pressure, Yeah. -
right. You know, the way that this career was described to me the day
I got my job, was one colleague of mine, the late Ben Barres said,
welcome to schizophrenia 'cause you're never going to be able to
complete anything without getting interrupted. That was partially
true, although I've created buffers. And the other one, very
successful scientist, member of the National Academy, et cetera, said
to me, you know, just remember, it's pinball. You never win. The best
you can do is just keep playing. Yes, right. - And I thought wow,
okay. Okay. And then you just go. Right. - But I think that as we
achieve more, not just academics of course, but as anyone achieves
more, there's the relishing in the accomplishment. There's often the
desire for more, but there's also the pressure of, well now I have to
do this for the next 30 years, even though I love it. It's the
pressure of, well, if the mountain is this high, then how do I get
here and here and here, and then you start shoveling more dirt on so
you can keep climbing. And it's a lot of work. [Anna] Yes. And I think
that the perception of success is that there's a roar of the crowd and
you cruise. You don't cruise. They just give you more to do. Right. -
Or you give yourself more to do. Well what I think is, at least in my
life experience, and I've heard this from other people as well, you
know, it's that prize that we're going for, that if we get it is so
unsatisfying. And it's the prize that we never imagined that we kind
of go, well, how did that happen, but gee, you know, that feels good.
And so I'm very, what's the It's like a mirage Yeah. - in the one
case. Yeah. It's almost like dopamine can create these mirages. Yes.
That there's some place there. - That's right. And if I just, it's
that pot of gold. If I just- - Constant dopamine. Right, right, that's
right. - Constant dopamine. And I think, you know, this really, I
think, is related to our discussion earlier about this taking it one
day at time, or paying attention to that, you know, 24-hour period in
your environment. I am absolutely fascinated by the ways in which we
accumulate success, when we do that, totally independent of the desire
for success. It's really process-oriented. It's like, where am I
today? How can I make today a good and meaningful day, a little bit
better, or as good as some other days I've had? Constantly tweaking
and experimenting with this experiment that we call our human
existence. And when we do that in a way that's authentic and paying
attention and value-driven, whatever our, you know, values are
informed by, it is very, very interesting how those days again
accumulate, and you find, well, I guess I contributed something of
value there, but I wasn't trying to do that. You know, I think that's
really, I mean, what I'm so amazed by is like, you know, 20 years ago
when I went to Stanford Medical School, or 25 years ago, you know, I
just, I was happy to just be a good doctor. I was like, I guess I'm
just going to try to figure out how to be a good doctor, I'm here to
learn that. And now I see these medical students, and they're
wonderful. They're brilliant and they're - They are. well-intentioned,
all that. But they're like how can I, you know, write the great
American novel, do my startup, go to Africa, apply for that grant? You
know, it's like, really, I was just trying to learn how to be a
doctor. And it's, as you say, it's a lot of pressure on them. And it's
also kind of a weird leapfrogging of the real way to accomplish
something. Right. - Which isn't about like oh how can I accomplish
something. It's like, what can I do today that would be of service.
Right? And then finding that of trying to be of service, you know, and
not really going for recognition, can sometimes lead to what people
call success, although that wasn't what you were aiming for. And it's
all the more beautiful when it's not what you're aiming for. Oh so
much better, so much better. Yeah, I'm a big believer that when one
can align their compulsion with some greater good. Yes, right. - A
service to humanity or the planet or animals, whatever it is, that's
where the really good stuff emerges. Because there's a lot of
reciprocity there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=7090"&gt;Reciprocity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world starts to, you're supporting the world and then it starts to
support you in a way that feels very fluid. - And it comes back.
Right, and I mean that speaks to you like your generosity to me, vis-
a-vis my book. And I have to say Well, I love the book. I know, it's
There's like, we're not in a business deal folks. It's just purely
that I heard Anna lecture in my course, I wanted to learn more about
dopamine. She taught me, I asked her if she would come on the podcast.
Turned out she wrote this amazing book. She sent me an advanced copy
of the book. I read it in one sweep, it's incredible. And I love it.
So just like the eight year old version of me, now the 45 version of
myself, I can't stop blabbing about the things I love. Well it's
awesome, but I have to say, I have been surprised by your generosity.
It's not something I've encountered frequently at Stanford, which is a
wonderful place. But there is a general sense that if I give away to
somebody else, I've lost something, which is not the right way to
think about it. Not how you are, and also not how the world works,
'cause when we give away to other people, we get back so much more.
But it takes a long time and it might not come through that path. I
never think about reciprocity. But I was weaned by good advisers.
That's very nice, Yeah. - yeah. I think it just sort of got drilled
into me that the more you give, the better your immediate life is.
Yes, yeah. And I also don't have a long-term vision, you know. I just,
I'm just excited about the book. I'm excited that people are learning
about the brain and dopamine. I have to admit, having grown up in
neuroscience essentially, I did not understand that pleasure and pain
were orchestrated the way that they are. I'm very mindful of it now.
Oh good. And it's changed a number of my behaviors. I know a number of
people are going to have questions and want to get in contact with
you. You are not on social media. That's correct, yes. You are true to
your ideology. That's great. And the reason for that is just, I
wouldn't be able to control myself. I mean, that really would be my
drug. People are my drug, intimacy is my drug, and I wouldn't be able
to manage it. And so just, it was just easier for me to not do it at
all, rather than try to moderate it. Well the book, as you mentioned
before, and as I can attest to, is it has a certain intimacy. People
get to know you through the book. So definitely check out the book. If
you have questions about the book, et cetera, you're welcome to send
them my way. I will buffer you from all those questions. I'll filter
them. Anna, Dr. Lembke, I should be formal, forgive me, I've been
referring to you No no, that's fine. - as Anna the whole way through,
'cause we're colleagues, but thank you so much for sharing this
information. And I know I learned a ton. and I know everyone else is
going to learn a lot more about addiction and the good side of
dopamine. That's right. Thank you for having me. It's been really,
really great to talk with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&amp;amp;t=7275"&gt;Closing Comments, Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, thank you. Thank you for joining me for my discussion with Dr.
Anna Lembke. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. Please be sure to
check out her new book, "Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age
of Indulgence". You can pre-order it on Amazon or any places where
books are sold. It's an absolutely fascinating and engaging read, all
about addiction and dopamine. If you're learning from, and or enjoying

&lt;p&gt;We discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to
certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our "dopamine
balance" plays in creating addiction. We also discuss the science and
practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to
avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics
closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying and
she explains why telling the truth—even about the most basic things in
daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions
of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care
professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is
determined to stay clean. Last but not least, it helps explain why all
humans do what we do, and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of
pleasure seeking in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Andrew Huberman] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we
discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [bright
upbeat music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology
and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we continue
our discussion of the senses. And the senses we are going to discuss
are pain and pleasure. Pain and pleasure reflect two opposite ends of
a continuum, a continuum that involves detection of things in our skin
and the perception, the understanding of what those events are. Our
skin is our largest sensory organ and our largest organ indeed. It is
much larger than any of the other organs in our body. And it's an odd
organ if you think about it, it has so many functions. It acts as a
barrier between our organs and the outside world, it harbors neurons
nerve cells that allow us to detect things like light touch, or
temperature or pressure of various kinds. And it's an organ that we
hang ornaments on. People put earrings in their ears. People decorate
their skin with tattoos and inks and other things. And it's an organ
that allows us to experience either great pain or great pleasure. So
it's a multifaceted organ and it's one that our brain needs to make
sense of in a multifaceted way. So today we're going to discuss all
that. And most importantly, how you can experience more pleasure and
less pain by understanding these pathways. We will also discuss things
you can do, and if you wish things you can take that will allow you to
experience more pleasure and less pain in response to a variety of
different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=110"&gt;Protocol 1: Maximizing Motivation (with Dopamine &amp;amp; Pleasure)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go any further, I want to highlight a particularly exciting
area of science that relates to the skin and to sensing of pleasure
and pain, but has everything to do with motivation. Motivation is
something that many people struggle with, not everybody, but most
people experience dips and peaks in their motivation even if they
really want something. How should we think about these changes in
motivation? What do they reflect? Well at a very basic level, they
reflect fluctuations changes in the levels of a chemical called
dopamine. Most of us have heard of dopamine. Dopamine is a
neuromodulator meaning it modulates or changes the way that neurons
nerve cells work. Most of us have heard that dopamine is the molecule
of pleasure. However, that is incorrect. Dopamine is a molecule of
motivation and anticipation. To illustrate how dopamine works, I want
to highlight some very important work largely carried out by the
laboratory of a guy named Wolfram Schultz. The Schultz Laboratory has
done dozens of excellent experiments on the dopamine system and have
identified something called reward prediction error. Although in some
sense you can think about it as reward prediction variance. Changes in
the levels of dopamine depending on whether or not you expect a reward
and whether or not you get the reward. So I'm going to make this very
simple. Dopamine is released into the brain and body and generally
makes us feel activated and motivated, as if we have energy to pursue
a goal. And it is released into the brain and body in anticipation of
a reward. Measurements of dopamine have been made in animals and
humans. And what you find is that when we anticipate a reward,
dopamine is released, we will put in the work to achieve that reward.
That work could be mental work or physical work, but when the reward
arrives, dopamine levels drop back down to baseline. That's right.
When we receive a reward, dopamine levels go back down to baseline. So
the way to envision this as you can just imagine a sort of increase in
dopamine as we anticipate something we're working towards it, we're
working towards a goal. We're excited about seeing somebody or meeting
somebody or receiving some reward and then the reward comes and
dopamine goes down. Now that's all fine and good, but there is a way
to get much more dopamine out of that process and therefore a way to
have much more motivation, energy, and focus because those are the
consequences of elevated dopamine. The way to do that is to not
deliver the reward on an expected schedule. So experiments have been
done where there's an anticipation of a reward, there's work, and then
the reward only arrives every other or every third about of work,
okay? So this would be like getting a pat on the head. If you're a dog
or a, perhaps a child or an adult, or getting a monetary reward only
for every third project or every third race that you win. Pick any
kind of goal. It doesn't matter. These molecules don't care about what
you're pursuing. They are a common currency of different types of
activities. That's a regular reward schedule, and it will not alter
the pattern of dopamine release that I described before. However, if
the reward arrives intermittently almost randomly, so you anticipate a
reward as a maybe it might come, it might come. Then you work, work,
work, work, work, no reward. You repeat the work, work, work, work,
work, work, and then you get a reward. So some trials, you do some
trials, you don't, and it's completely random. Under those conditions,
the amplitude, the amount of dopamine that's released into your system
and the motivation to continue working hard or playing whatever kind
of game you're playing, doubles or triples. And this is the basis of
things like slot machines and gambling. And this is why so many people
will give so much of their money up to casinos and the casinos always
win. Sometimes people walk away with more money than they came to the
casino with, but the vast majority of the time, the house wins as they
say. And it's because they understand intermittent reward schedules.
And you can apply this to stay motivated in your own pursuits. Rather
than thinking about the pleasure of a reward, understand that dopamine
is released in response to anticipation reward, and that is the fuel
for work. And every once in awhile at random remove the reward. That's
the way to continue to stay motivated. Not to reward every action or
every goal. And this is also true, if you're trying to train up
children or train up players on a team, you should not celebrate every
win. I know that's a little counter-intuitive, we're going to go more
into the biology of dopamine and how it relates to the pleasure system
later on in the podcast, but for now understand intermittent reward
schedules harness the biology of dopamine in ways that can allow you
essentially infinite motivation over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go any further, I want to acknowledge that this podcast is
separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is
however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science and science-related tools to the general
public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of
today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is
a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood
and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach
your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood
work done for the simple reason that many, if not all of the factors
that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed
from a quality blood test. And nowadays with the advent of DNA tests,
you can get further knowledge into the mechanisms that are going on in
your body and how those mechanisms are changing as they relate to
metabolism and hormones and other aspects that profoundly impact your
wellbeing. The problem with most blood tests, however, is that you get
information back and it will tell you whether or not your levels of
something are higher, low, or within range, but it doesn't give you
any directives. It doesn't tell you what to do with that information.
With InsideTracker has this wonderful feature. It's a very easy to use
dashboard that has suggestions about lifestyle factors, exercise,
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, that one could take in order to
adjust those numbers according to your personal goals. So the whole
thing is made very easy. In fact, they can come to your home to do the
blood test and DNA test if you like. If you'd like to try
InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do
that you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the
code huberman@checkout. And I should also mention that through August
15th, 2021, you can get a free inner age test. That's a measure of
your biological age according to your DNA and other factors with any
purchase from InsideTracker store. So go to insidetracker.com/huberman
to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans and up to up and through
August 15th, you can get a free inner age test. Today's episode is
also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix makes mattresses and pillows
that are ideally suited to your sleep needs. Everybody's different.
Some people sleep on their sides, some people sleep on their stomach,
some people sleep on their back, some people run warm during the
night, some people run cold. If you go to the Helix's website,
helixsleep.com, you can take a quick two-minute quiz, and then it will
tell you what your ideal mattress is. It will match you to your ideal
mattress. I did this and I matched to the so-called Dusk mattress. I
like a mattress that's not too firm nor too soft. I tend to run hot
during the night and I tend to sleep on my side or on my stomach. I
started sleeping on a Helix mattress about nine months ago, and I'm
sleeping better than I ever have before. So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress to one that's ideally suited to your sleep
needs, go to helixsleep.com/huberman, take their two-minutes sleep
quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress. And you'll get
up to $200 off that mattress order, and two free pillows. They have a
10-year warranty and you get to try out the mattress for a 100 nights
risk-free, they'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it, but I
think you really will love it. So again, if you're interested, go to
helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic
Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started
drinking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started drinking Athletic
Greens and the reason why I still drink it once or even twice a day is
because it takes care of all my foundational nutritional needs. It
includes vitamins, minerals, and probiotics which are important for
the gut microbiome, this colony of bacteria, healthy bacteria that we
all have living in our guts. And when that bacteria is healthy, our
brain functions better, our immune system functions better. There is
now a lot of research to support that. Athletic Greens taste
delicious. I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice. And
as I mentioned, I drink it once or twice a day, usually in the morning
and again in the afternoon. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you
can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and claim a special offer. That
special offer is a year supply of vitamin D3K2. There's now a robust
literature showing that vitamin D3 is critical for various aspects of
our health, metabolic health, endocrine health, et cetera. And you'll
also get five free travel packs. When you travel mixing up Athletic
Greens is made really easy by these little travel packs. You just put
them in a jar or other a water bottle, mix it with water. It's very
easy to do on a plane or in the et cetera. Again, go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the Athletic Greens, the five free
travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3K2. So let's talk about
pleasure and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=724"&gt;Pleasure &amp;amp; Pain, &amp;amp; Skin Sensors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we all intuitively understand what pleasure and pain are.
Pleasure generally is a sensation in the body and in the mind that
leads us to pursue more of whatever is bringing about that sensation.
And pain is also a sensation in the body and in the mind that in
general leads us to want to withdraw or move away from some activity
or interaction. That's not always the case. Some people actively seek
out pain. Some people somehow can't seem to engage with or experience
pleasure, but most people operate on this basis of pleasure and pain.
Scientists would call this appetitive behaviors, meaning behaviors
that lead us to create an appetite for more of those behaviors and
aversive behaviors, behaviors that make us want to move away from
something. The simplest example of that would be putting your hand
near a hot flame, at some point, there would be a reflex or a deep
desire to withdraw your hand. Tasting something delicious in general
makes us want to eat more of that thing. Interactions with other
people that we find delicious, also make us want to interact with
those people more. None of this is complicated or sophisticated. This
is simply to illustrate the fact that pleasure and pain tend to evoke
opposite responses, opposite behavioral responses and opposite
emotional responses. So how does that come about? Well, it really
comes about by an interaction that starts at one end of our body,
meaning our skin and the other end of the organs of our body, which is
deep within the brain. So let's consider these two ends of the
spectrum of pleasure and pain and what they contribute to those
experiences of pleasure and pain. The organ that we call the skin, as
I mentioned earlier, is the largest organ in our body. And throughout
that organ, we have neurons, little nerve cells. Now to be really
technical about it, and the way I'd like you to understand it is that
the so-called cell body meaning the location of a cell in which the
DNA and other goodies the kind of central factory of the cell, that
actually sits right outside your spinal cord. So all up and down your
spinal cord on either side are these little blobs of neurons, little
collections of neurons. They have a name if you'd like to know for you
aficionado or those who are curious, they're called DRGs dorsal root
ganglia. A ganglion is just a collection or clump of cells. And those
DRGs are really interesting because they send one branch that we call
an axon, a little wire out to our skin, also to our muscles into our
organs, but here we're talking about the skin. They send a wire out to
our skin and that wire literally reaches up into the skin. It's
actually in our skin and they have another wire from that same cell
body that goes in the opposite direction, which is up to our brain and
creates connections within our brain in the so-called brainstem. What
this means is that the neuron in your body that we call the DRG that
sends a wire an axon to sense what's going on in your big toe and then
sends another axon in the opposite direction into the base of your
brain, that is the largest cell in your entire body of any kind. Fat
cell, muscle cell, nerve cell, et cetera. Is extremely long cells. It
can be a meter or more depending on how tall you happen to be. So we
have these cells that have wires they go off in two different
directions and the wire that's within our skin will respond to any
number of different categories of stimuli. These wires are positioned
within the skin to respond to mechanical forces. So maybe light touch,
some will only send electrical activity up toward the brain in
response to light touch. Meaning if you press on the skin really hard,
they don't respond. You stroke the skin lightly with your fingertips
or a feather and they respond very robustly. Others respond to course
pressure, the hard pressure, but they won't respond to a light
feather, for instance. Others respond to temperature. So they will
respond to the presence of heat or the presence of cold or changes in
heat and cold. And still others respond to other types of stimuli,
like certain chemicals on our skin. Many of you have probably
experienced the sensation of eating a hot pepper. Well, I don't
recommend doing this, but were you to take a little slice of jalapeno
or other hot pepper, habanero pepper or something like that and rub it
on your skin, you would actually feel something at that location. And
that's because that pepper doesn't just create a sensation within your
mouth, it will create a similar sensation on your skin. So these
neurons are amazing. They're collecting information of particular
kinds from the skin throughout the entire body and sending that
information up toward the brain. And what's really incredible, I just
want you to ponder this for a second. What's really incredible is that
the language that those neurons use is exactly the same. The neuron
that responds to light touch sends electrical signals up toward the
brain, the neurons that respond to cold or to heat or to habanero
pepper, they only respond to the particular thing that evokes the
electrical response. I should say that they only respond to the
particular stimulus, the pepper, the cold, the heat, et cetera, that
will evoke an electrical signal, but the electrical signals are a
common language that all neurons use. And yet, if something cold is
presented to your skin, like an ice cube, even if you don't see that
ice cube, if your eyes are closed, or someone comes up behind you and
puts an ice cube against your bare skin back, you know that that
sensation, that thing is cold. You don't misperceive it as heat or as
a habanero pepper. So that's amazing. What that means is that there
must be another element in the equation of what creates pleasure or
pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=1093"&gt;Sensing Touch with Your Brain: Magnification of Feet, Hands, Lips, Face, Genitals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that element is your brain. Your brain takes these electrical
signals and interprets them. Partially based on experience, but also
there are some innate meaning some hard wired aspects of pain and
pleasure sensing that require no experience whatsoever. A child
doesn't have to fall down but once to know on that first fall, that
hurt. They don't have to touch a flame, but once and the very first
time they will withdraw their hand from the flame. So no prior
experiences required. Other things prior experience is required. For
instance, if you're somebody that has an intense, intense aversion to
spicy foods, that's probably because you've tasted spicy foods before.
Likewise, if you really like sweet foods, it's probably because you've
tasted them before. So you can start to make predictions based on
prior experience, but the pain and pleasure system don't need prior
experience. What they need is a brain that can interpret these
electrical signals that can take these electrical signals and somehow
create what we call pleasure and pain out of them. So what parts of
the brain? Well, mainly it's the so-called somatosensory cortex. The
portion of our neocortex, which is on the outside of our brain, that
kind of bumpy part, not kind of if you have a normally formed brain,
it will be bumpy. If you have a smooth brain that's not good. Some
animals just have a smooth brain. Humans have a bumpy brain, which
means it has a very large surface area. And those bumps are 'cause you
squeezed it like a pizza and clump and you bunched it all up and put
inside the skull. That's good. That means you have a lot of neurons.
And in your somatosensory cortex, you have a map of your entire body
surface. That map is called a homunculus. And if we were to take your
cortex and lay it out on a table, I've actually done this with the
cortices of various animals and humans included. What you would find
is that there's literally a map of your entire body surface. But it
wouldn't look exactly like you, this map would be very distorted. Why
would it be distorted? Well, certain areas of your body have a much
denser innervation as we call it, or put simply many more of these
sensory wires from these DRGs within your skin. So this map of you
that exists in your brain, and you do have one of these on each side
of your brain, so you have two of these maps to homunculi, that is
you, it's your representation of touch including pleasure and pain.
And in that map, your lips are enormous. And your back is very, very
small. And the area around your eyes and the area representing your
face is absolutely enormous. So you would look like some sort of odd,
weird clay doll from some sort of bizarre late night animation thing.
And just imagine the psychedelic experience of that character of you
and that's what it would look like. But it's not randomly organized.
To the contrary, it's highly organized in a very particular way, which
is that the areas of your skin that have the highest density of the
sensory receptors are magnified in your brain. So it's sort of like
having more pixels in a certain part of a camera than others, and in
doing that allowing higher resolution in this case of touch, not a
vision, but of touch sensation in certain parts of your body. What are
the areas that are magnified? Well, the lips, the face, the tips of
the fingers, the feet, and the genitals. And so this map of you has
very large lips, face, tips of fingers, bottoms of feet, and genitals.
And that's because the innervation, the number of wires that go into
those regions of your body far exceeds the number of wires for
sensation of touch that go to other areas of your body. You can
actually experience this in real time right now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=1336"&gt;Two-Point Discrimination, Dermatomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by doing a simple experiment that we call two-point discrimination.
Two-points discrimination is your ability to know whether or not two
points of pressure are far apart, near each other, or you actually
could perceive incorrectly as one point of pressure. You might want a
second person to do this experiment. Here's how you would do it. You
will close your eyes, that person would take two fine points. Don't
make them too sharp, please. So it could be two pencils or pens or the
backs of pens. Two pens I'm holding in my hands. If you're just
listening to this, I'm just holding two pens. My favorite pens, these
pilot, V5 or V7, which I love. If you were to close your eyes and I
were to take these two pens and put their points close together about
a centimeter apart and present them to the top of your hand, I'm going
to just going to do that now to myself. You, even though your eyes
were closed, you would be able to perceive that that was two points of
pressure presented simultaneously to the top of your hand. However, if
I were to do this to the middle of your back, you would not experience
them as two points of pressure. You would experience them as one
single point of pressure. In other words, your two point
discrimination is better, is higher on areas of your body which have
many, many more sensory receptors. You are more sensitive at those
locations. Now this makes perfect sense once you experience it or you
hear about it. However, most of us don't really appreciate how
important and what a profound influence this change in density of
receptors across our body surface has. And we can go a step further
and describe another feature of the way that you're built and the way
that you experience pleasure and pain, which is called the dermatome.
The dermatome is literally the way in which your body surface is
carved up into different territories. Much like a map of the United
States is carved up into different territories of states and counties,
et cetera. The dermatome is the way in which neurons connect to
different parts of your body. Now, you've actually experienced the
dermatome before. The dermatome is when you have a neuron that
connects to a particular area of the body and that neuron doesn't just
send one little wire out like one little line and go up into the skin
to detect mechanical, or thermal, or chemical stimuli. It actually
sends many branches out like a tree. But remember those branches of
the tree come from one single neuron. Now, occasionally what will
happen is you will experience something like cold, or heat, or pain,
or tingling on a patch of your body. And occasionally that patch of
body will actually have a very cleanly demarcated boundary, a very
stark boundary with the areas around it. A good example of this would
be the herpes simplex 1 virus, which if one has this virus, and I
should mention that somewhere between 80 and 90% of people have this
virus, this is not a sexually transmitted virus. This is a virus is
transmitted very easily between people through various forms of
contact non-sexual contact, it's present in children, it's present in
adults and most people get it, some get symptoms and some don't some
get recurring symptoms, some don't. We can talk about that at the end,
if you like, but this virus lives on what's called the fifth cranial
nerve also called the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve sends
branches out to the lips, to the eyes, and to certain portions of the
face. So for those of you listening, I've just kind of put my right
hand across my face and to sort of simulate the three branches, the
trigeminal aspect of this nerve. So tri three. Now, when the herpes
virus flares up, as they say, in response to stress or other factors,
the virus inflames that nerve and people experience tingling and pain
on the nerve. Sometimes they'll get a cold sore or a blister on their
lip or near their mouth, sometimes they'll get a collection of those.
And that's because that dermatome is actually inflamed. Now other
people will experience something like shingles. It's a fairly common
viral infection. And what they'll notice is they'll get a rash that
has a boundary. It's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps, sometimes
blisters, and it'll have a sharp boundary. That boundary exists
because the virus exists on the nerve. And so it actually is
boundaried with the neighboring area of the body that's receiving
input from another nerve and that one doesn't have the virus living on
it. So anytime you see a rash or a pattern on the body surface on the
skin that has a pretty stark boundary, chances are that's an event
that's impacting the dermatome. I've experienced this before then not
through herpes simplex, but through the experience of having a lot of
blood sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment across the front of
my face, it was really bizarre. I looked in the mirror and I thought,
what is going on here? I was having an allergic reaction to something
I'd eaten. And that allergic reaction clearly was affecting one of the
nerves and therefore the dermatome and what it showed up was, it was
almost like someone had drawn lines on my face that said, okay, this
rash or this reaction rather can happen here, but not in a region
right next to it. Whenever you see that chances are it's a reaction of
the nerves of the dermatome. So you'll start to see these things more
and more when you start to look for them. You don't always have to
have a viral infection to experience this. Sometimes you'll just
experience tingling or even a pleasant sensation, and it will be
restricted in kind of a strict boundary on one location or your body
surface and not another. Not corresponding to an organ like, okay,
this arm or just your feet or something like that. But just a segment.
It's almost like someone outlined a particular area of her body
surface. That's the dermatome. So you've got sensors in the skin and
you've got a brain that's going to interpret what's going on with
those sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=1691"&gt;Thoughts &amp;amp; Genes That Make Physical Pain Worse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we can take an example of a sudden rash or inflammation at
one location, the dermatome, and we can ask what would make it hurt?
What would make it worse? What would make it go away? And believe it
or not, your subjective interpretation of what's happening has a
profound influence on your experience of pleasure or pain. There are
several things that can impact these experiences, but the main
categories are expectation. So sort of whether or not you thought or
could expect that this thing was going to happen, right? If someone
tells you this is going to hurt, I'm going to give you an injection
right here, it might hurt for a second. That's very different and your
experience of that pain will be very different than if it happened
suddenly out of the blue. There's also anxiety, how anxious, or how
high or low your level of arousal, autonomic arousal, that's going to
impact your experience of pleasure or pain. How well you slept and
where you are in the so-called circadian or 24-hour cycle. Our ability
to tolerate pain changes dramatically across the 24-hour cycle. And as
you can imagine is during the daylight waking hours that we are better
able to tolerate, we are more resilient to pain, and we are better
able to experience pleasure. At night our threshold for pain is much
lower. In other words, the amount of mechanical or chemical or thermal
meaning temperature stimulated that can evoke a pain response and how
we rate that response is much lower at night. And in particular, in
the hours between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM, if you're on a kind of standard
circadian schedule. And then the last one is our genes. Pain threshold
and how long a pain response lasts is in part dictated by our genes.
And later I'm going to discuss this myth or whether or not it's really
a myth as to whether or not certain people in particular red heads,
people who have reg pigmented hair and fair skin, whether or not their
pain thresholds differ. And to just give you a little sneak peek into
that, indeed they do and it's because of a genetic difference in a
particular gene, in a particular pattern of receptors in the skin that
are related to the pigmentation of hair and skin. So we have
expectation, anxiety, how well we've slept, where we are in the so-
called 24-hour circadian time and our genes. So let's talk about
expectation and anxiety because those two factors can powerfully
modulate our experience of both pleasure and pain in ways that will
allow us to dial up pleasure if we like and to dial down pain, if
indeed that's what we want to do. So let's talk about expectation and
anxiety because those two things are somewhat tethered. There are now
a number of solid experiments, both in animal models and in humans
that point to the fact that if we know a painful stimulus is coming,
that we can better prepare for it mentally and therefore buffer or
reduce the pain response. However, the timing in which that
anticipation occurs is vital for this to happen. And if that timing
isn't quite right, it actually can make the experience of pain far
worse. So here I'm summarizing a large amount of literature, but
essentially if subjects are warned that a painful stimulus is coming,
their subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced. However,
if they are warned just two seconds before that pain arrives, it does
not help. It actually makes it worse. And the reason is they can't do
anything mentally to prepare for it in that brief two second window.
Similarly, if they are warned about pain that's coming two minutes
before a painful stimulus is coming electric shock or a poke or cold
stimulus or heat stimulus that's pretty extreme, that also makes it
worse because their expectation ramps up the autonomic arousal. The
level of alertness is all funneled toward that negative experience
that's coming. So how soon before a painful stimulus should we know
about it if the goal is to reduce our level of pain? And the answer is
somewhere between 20 seconds and 40 seconds is about right. Now, I'm
averaging across a number of different studies, but if you have about
20 seconds or 40 seconds advance warning that something bad is coming,
you can prepare yourself for that, but the preparation itself and the
arousal that comes with it, the kind of leaning in, okay, I'm either
going to relax myself or I'm going to really kind of dig my heels in
and kind of meet the pain head on. That seems to be the optimal
window. This can come and useful in a variety of contexts, but I think
it's important because what it illustrates is that it absolutely
cannot be just the pattern of signals that are arriving from the skin,
from these DRGs, these neurons that connect to skin that dictates our
experience of pain or pleasure. There has to be a subjective
interpretation component, and indeed that's the case. So let's talk
about the range of pain experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=2025"&gt;Expectations, Anxiety, &amp;amp; Pain Threshold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from that, we will understand better what the range of pleasure
experiences are that different people have because we are all
different in terms of our pain threshold. First of all, what is pain
threshold? Pain threshold has two dimensions. The first dimension is
the amount of mechanical or chemical or thermal stimulation that it
takes for you or me or somebody else to say, I can't take that
anymore. I'm done. But there's another element as well which is how
long the pain persists. I'll just describe myself for example, I don't
consider myself somebody who has a particularly high pain threshold. I
don't think it's particularly low either, but I wouldn't consider
myself somebody that has a particularly high pain threshold. When I
stubbed my toe against the corner of the bed, it absolutely hurts. But
one thing that I've noticed is that I have very sharp inflections,
very high inflections in my perception of pain, and then they go away
quickly. I don't know if that's adaptive or not. It's probably not,
but my experience of pain is very intense, but very brief. Other
people experience pain in a much kind of slower rising, but longer-
lasting manner. And to just really point out how varied we all are in
terms of our experience of pain, let's look to an experiment. There
been experiments done at Stanford School of Medicine and elsewhere,
which involved having subjects put their hand into a very cold vat of
water and measuring the amount of time that they kept their hand in
that water. And then they would tell the experimenter very quietly,
how painful that particular stimulus was on a scale of one to 10 so-
called Likert scale for your aficionados. That simple experiment
revealed that people experience the same thermal in this case, cold
stimulus, vastly different. Some people would rate it as a 10 out of
10 extreme pain. Other people would rate it as barely painful at all,
like a one. Other people, a three other people, a five, et cetera. Now
what's interesting is that the same thing is true for experience of a
hot, painful stimulus 120 degree hot plate, where you have to put your
hand on it, and then at some point you remove your hand. Some people
are able to keep their hand on there the whole time, but people rate
that experience as very painful, a little bit painful or moderately
painful depending on who they are. Now, that's interesting, probably
not that surprising, however, but what is very interesting is that
when the same experiment was done on medical doctors or medical
doctors in training, they too of course experienced pain through a
range of subjective experiences. Some of them just like any other
person off the street said a particular stimulus of a particular
temperature was very painful, other said it wasn't painful at all and
some said it was moderately painful. And that turns out to be vitally
important for the treatment of pain because pain is not an event in
the skin. Pain is a subjective, emotional experience. You may have
heard that we have a particular category of these DRGs that innervate
the skin, which are called nociceptors. Nociceptor comes from the word
noci, nocere I believe it is, which means to harm. However,
nociceptors don't carry information about pain, they carry information
about particular types of stimuli impacting the skin. And then the
brain assigns a value of valence to it, a label and says that's
painful. And where people draw the line between not painful and
painful varies. Now, because physicians are people and because
physicians treat pain, what we know from a lot of data now is that if
someone comes into the clinic and says they're experiencing chronic
pain or whole body pain or acute pain after an injury or one location,
it doesn't really matter what the cause is or even if there's a cause
at all, how the doctor reacts to that report of the patient's pain
will dictate in many cases the course of treatment. And of course
doctors, their goal is to treat the patient to going to the patient's
needs, not their own. And that's what good doctors do. However, it's
been found and I think now there is work being done to try and change
this, but if a doctor has a very high threshold for pain, their
interpretation of somebody else's report of pain is going to be
different. They might not discount the patient, right? This doesn't
necessarily mean that they think, oh, this person their pain is
irrelevant, probably not. In fact, from having a high threshold for
pain, if someone comes in and says, I'm in extreme pain, that doctor
probably thinks, wow, this has to be really, really extreme, but they
can be talking about two different experiences. Similarly, if a
physician has a very low threshold for pain, and someone comes in and
says, yeah, I'm experiencing some pain in my back. I've got the
sciatica thing, but yeah, it's a little bit uncomfortable. It's like
a, I don't know like a four out of 10. Well, that physician might
interpret that four out of 10 as a pretty extreme sense of pain or
pretty extreme experience of pain. And so you can start to see how the
subjective nature of pain can start to have real impact on the
treatment of pain because treatment of pain is carried out by
physicians. In fact, there is no objective measure of pain. We can ask
how long somebody can keep their hand on a hot plate or in a cold
bath. You can do various experiments. They even have some extreme
experiments where they'll shave a portion of the leg and they'll put
on a very painful chemical compound and see how long people can
tolerate that. These are very uncomfortable experiments as you can
imagine, but in general, we don't have a way of measuring somebody
else's subjective experience of pain. There is no blood pressure
measure. There's no heart rate beats per minute measure of pain. So
one of the great efforts of neuroscience and of medicine is to try and
come up with more objective measures of pain. Similarly, pleasure is
something that we all talk about. Ooh, that feels so good, or I love
that or more of that please or less of that, but we have no way of
gauging what other people are experiencing except what they report
through language. And so this is really just to illustrate that this
whole thing around pain isn't a black box. We do have an understanding
of the elements. There are elements in the skin, there's elements of
the brain, there's expectation, anxiety, sleep, and genes, but that it
is very complicated. And yet there are certain principles that fall
out of that complicated picture that can allow us to better understand
and navigate this axis that we call the pleasure-pain axis. So rather
than focus on just the subjective nature of pain,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=2427"&gt;Protocol 2: Cold Sensing Is Relative; Getting Into Cold Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let's talk about the absolute qualities of pain and the absolute
qualities of pleasure so that we can learn how to navigate those two
experiences in ways that serve us each better. First of all, I want to
talk about heat and cold. We do indeed have sensors in our skin that
respond to heat and cold. And for any of you that have entered a cold
shower or a cold body of water of any kind or ice bath, et cetera, you
will realize that getting into cold is much harder if you do it
slowly. Now, despite that people tend to do it very slowly. I have
noticed an enormous variation with which people can embrace the
experience of cold. I noticed it because I do some work with athletes
and I do some work with military and I do some work with the general
public. And one of the best tests of how somebody can handle pain is
to ask them to just get into an ice bath. It's not a very
sophisticated experience, but it really gets into the core of the kind
of circuitry that we're talking about, both in the skin and in the
brain. Some people regardless of sex, regardless of age, and
regardless of physical ability can just get into the cold. They're
somehow able to do it. Now, I don't know what their experience of the
cold is. And neither do you. You only know your experience, but
they're able to do that. Some do it quickly, some do it slowly. Others
find the experience of cold to be so aversive that they somehow cannot
get themselves in. They start quaking, they start complaining and many
of them just simply get out. They can't do it. Some don't even get in
past their knees. This isn't necessarily about pain threshold, but
it's related to that. I think it can be helpful to everyone to know
that even though it feels better at a mental level to get into the
cold slowly and people ask, oh, I just want to get in slowly, I want
to take my time. It is actually much worse from a neuro-biological
perspective. The neurons that sense cold respond to what are called
relative drops in temperature. So it's not about the absolute
temperature of the water. It's about the relative change in
temperature. So as you move from a particular temperature, whether or
not it's in the air next to an ice bath or cold shower, or from a body
of water that's warm to a body of water that's colder, or sometimes in
the ocean, you'll notice it's warm. And then as you swim out further,
you'll get into a pocket of water where it's much colder. That's when
the cold receptors in your skin start firing and sending signals up to
your brain. Therefore, you can bypass these signals going up to the
brain with each relative change one degree change, two degrees change,
et cetera, by simply getting in all at once. In fact it is true and
maybe you've been told this before, and it is true that if you get
into cold water up to your neck, it's actually much more comfortable
than if you're halfway in and halfway out. And that's because of the
difference in the signals that are being sent from the cold receptors
on your upper torso, which is out of the water in your lower torso.
Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this to mean that they should just
jump into an unknown body of water. There are all sorts of factors
like currents, and if it's very, very cold, yes, indeed. You can stop
the heart. People can have heart attacks from getting into extremely
cold water, like a melted mountain stream that's been frozen all
winter, or has been very, very cold or as a snow pack going into it.
If very cold, you can indeed have a heart attack. So please be smart
about how cold and what bodies of cold water you happen to put
yourself into. But it is absolutely true that provided it safe,
getting into a cold water is always going to be easier to do quickly
and is going to be easier to do up to your neck. In fact, you actually
want to get your shoulders submerged. There are a number of other
things you can do if you really want and it's safe to do. You can put
your face under and activate the so-called dive reflex, which also
makes the tolerance of cold easier believe it or not. So it's very
counterintuitive. It's like getting into water faster and more
completely you will experience as less uncomfortable, less cold. And
indeed that's the case. And that's because these cold receptors are
measuring every relative drop in temperature. So every single one is
graded as we say in biology, it's not absolute. As an additional
point, if you're sitting in a body of cold water and it's not
circulating, you'll notice that you start to warm up a little bit. Or
even if you feel like you're freezing cold, if you move and that water
around you moves, of course, then you'll notice it's got even colder.
And that's because there's a thermal layer. You're actually heating up
the water that surrounds your body like a halo around every aspect of
your body. A sort of silhouette of you of heat where you're heating
that water. When you move, you disrupt that thermal layer. Now heat is
the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=2722"&gt;Protocol 3: Heat Is Absolute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat and the heat receptors in your skin respond to absolute changes
in temperature. And this is probably because our body and our brain
can tolerate drops in temperature much better than it can tolerate
increases in temperature safely. So when you move from say a standard
outdoor environment, I mean, here in the States we measure in terms of
Fahrenheit. So maybe it's a 75 or an 80 degree, or even 90 degree day,
and you get into a 100 degrees sauna, or if you're in a cool air
conditioned building and you go outside and it's very warm outside,
you sort of feel like the heat hits you all at once, boom. Hits you
all at once, kind of like a slap in the face, but then it will just
stay at that level. Your body will acclimate to that particular
temperature. However, if that temperature is very, very high, you'll
notice that your experience of that heat and your experience of kind
of pain and discomfort and your desire to get out of that heat will
tend to persist. You don't really adapt in the same way. And certain
people who are really good at handling very hot sauna, get better at
this. You learned to calm your breathing, et cetera, lower your
autonomic arousal. Obviously you don't want to let your body
temperature go too high because neurons cook, they die. If neurons
die, they don't come back and that's bad. Many people unfortunately
harm themselves with hyperthermia. Everyone has a different threshold
for this, but in general, you don't want your body temperature to go
up too high. That's why a fever of like 103 starts to become worrisome
104. You really get concerned if and it goes up into that range or
higher, that's when you need to really cool down the body or get to
hospital so they can cool you down. Heat is measured in absolute terms
by the neurons. So gradually moving into heat makes sense, and finding
that threshold, which is safe and comfortable for you, or if it's
uncomfortable, at least resides within that realm of safety. So that's
heat and cold, and those are sort of non-negotiables. You can try and
lower your level of arousal. In fact, many people who get into a cold
shower and ice bath I think the recommendation that I always give is
that you have two possible approaches to that. You can either try and
relax yourself, kind of just stay calm within the cold, or you can
lean into it. You can actually take mental steps to generate more
adrenaline to kind of meet the demands of that cold. And at some point
we'll do a whole episode on how to use cold and heat to certain
advantages we've done a little bit of this in past episodes using the
cold to supercharge human performance and things of that sort. But in
general, cold is measured in relative terms. And therefore getting in
all at once is a good idea provided you can do it safely. And heat is
measured in absolute levels by your brain and body and therefore you
want to actually move into it gradually. So it's the kind of the
inverse of what you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=2890"&gt;Injury &amp;amp; Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things to understand about the experience of
pain and to really illustrate just how subjective pain really is, is
that our experience of pain and the degree of damage to our body are
not always correlated. And in fact, sometimes can be in opposite
directions. A good example of this would be x-rays. We all
occasionally get x-rays at least in the US we get x-rays when we go to
the dentist from time to time, and the occasional x-ray might be safe
depending on who you are provide you're not pregnant, et cetera. I've
gone to the dentist. They put you in the chair, they cover you with
the lead blanket, and then they run behind the screen to protect
themselves. And they beam me with the x-rays to get a picture of your
teeth and your jaws and your skull, et cetera. Well, if you were to
get too many x-rays, you could severely damage the tissues of your
body, but you don't experience any pain during the x-ray itself. In
contrast, you can think that your body is damaged and experienced
extreme pain and yet your body can have no damage. A classic example
of this was published in the British Journal of Medicine, in which a
construction worker fell from I think it was a second story, which he
was working and a nail went up and through his boot and he looked down
and he saw the nail going through his boot and he was in absolute
excruciating pain. They took him to the hospital and because the nail
was so long and because of where it had entered, it exited the boot,
they had to cut away the boot in order to get to the nail. And when
they did that, they revealed that the nail had passed between two of
his toes. It had actually failed to impale his body in any way. And
yet the view, the perception of that nail entering his boot at one end
and exiting the boot at the other was sufficient to create the
experience of a nail that had gone through his foot. And the moment he
realized that that nail had not gone through his foot, the pain
completely evaporated. And this has been demonstrated numerous times.
People that work in emergency rooms actually see variations on this.
Not always that extreme, but many times what we see and how we
perceive that wound or that event has a profound influence on how we
experience pain. And I mentioned this, not just because it's a kind of
sensational and fantastic example of this extreme, subjective nature
of pain, but also because it brings us back to this element which is,
we don't know how other people feel. Not just about pain, but about
pleasure. We think we do, we have some general sense of whether or not
an event ought to be painful or pleasurable, but actually we barely
understand how we feel let alone how other people feel, and we can be
badly wrong about how we feel meaning we can misinterpret our own
sense of pain or our own sense of pleasure depending on what we see
with our eyes and what we hear with our ears. So we hear a scream like
a shrill scream, and we think it must be pain. And if we look at
something that's happening to somebody and it fits a prior category or
a prior representation of what we would consider painful stimulus,
well, then we think that they're an extreme pain, but actually they
might not be in pain at all. Now this highly subjective nature of pain
and the way in which we use our visual system to interpret other
people's pain and our own pain has actually been leveraged to treat a
very extreme form of chronic pain. And it's an absolutely fascinating
area of biology and neuroscience. And it's one that we can actually
all leverage toward reducing our own levels of pain whenever we are
injured. Or believe it or not, even in chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=3124"&gt;Protocol 4: Plasticity of Pain: Key Role of Vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To describe this area of science requires a kind of extreme example,
but I want to be clear that even if you don't suffer from this extreme
example, there's relevance and a tool to extract for you. The extreme
example is that of an amputated digit, meaning one of your fingers or
your toes, or of an amputated limb. So people that have digits or
limbs that are gone missing from an injury or surgical removal, will
often have the experience that it's still there. The so-called phantom
limb phenomenon. Now, why would that be? Well, when you remove a
particular finger or limb, obviously that finger and limb is gone and
the dorsal root ganglion neuron that would normally send a wire out to
that particular region of the body, that wire is no longer there
because that portion of the body is no longer there. And in some
cases, those neurons die almost always, but not always. However, the
map your so-called homunculus, your representation of yourself in the
brain is still there. And this map, the so-called homunculus map that
you have in that I have is very plastic. It can change. And so as a
consequence areas of the map that adjacent to one another can actually
start to invade other areas of the map. So for instance, there are
neuroimaging studies that have documented that somebody that has say a
complete removal of their left arm, the representation of their left
arm still exists in the cortex. And experimentally if one is to
stimulate that area of the cortex, that person, and if that person
were you, would experience having that arm that it were being
stimulated, even though it's not there. Now, someone who has an
amputated arm doesn't need to have their brain stimulated in order to
have the experience of that phantom limb being present. In fact, many
people who have limbs that were amputated feel as if that limb is
still present even though obviously it's not. And no matter how many
times they look to the stump and just see a stump, somehow it doesn't
reorganize that homunculus so-called central brain map. Now, that
would be fine. You might even think that would be better, better to
think you have the arm there than to feel as if it's missing, and yet
many people who have amputated limbs report phantom limb pain. They
don't feel that the arm is just casually draped next to them. They
feel as if it's bunched up and it's an extreme pain. In fact, this
kind of contorted stance that I'm taking right here in my chair is not
unlike the way that these patients described this. They feel as if
it's kind of cramped up, it's very uncomfortable for them. Now, and
absolutely creative and you could even say genius scientists by the
name of Ramachandra. That's actually his last name, his complete name
is a little bit more complicated. So you all almost always hear
Ramachandran referred to as Ramachandran or V.S Ramachandran because
his full name is Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran. So a lot of
letters in there, a lot of vowels, but Ramachandran is a
neuroscientist. He was actually a colleague of mine when my lab was
formerly at the University of California, San Diego. Has done a lot of
work on this phantom limb phenomenon. And Ramachandra actually started
off as a vision scientist. And he understood the power of the visual
system in dictating our experience of things like pain and pleasure.
And so what he developed was a very low technology yet
neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment for phantom limb. It
consisted of a box, literally a box that had mirrors inside of it. And
the patient would put the intact hand or limb into one side, and
obviously they couldn't put the amputated limb into the other side,
but because of the configuration of the mirrors, it appeared as though
they had two symmetric limbs inside the box. And then he would have
them look at that limb and move it around. And as they would do this,
they would report real time movement, or I should say real time
perception of movement in the phantom limb. Now this is absolutely
incredible but makes total sense when you think about the so-called
top down or contextual modulation of our sensory experience, remember
it's anticipation, it's anxiety, it's interpretation of what's
happening that drives our perception of what's happening. And so, as
he would have these patients move their intact limb to a more relaxed
position, the patients would feel as if the phantom limb were
relaxing. And this was used successfully to treat phantom limb pain in
a number of different people. It didn't always work. And you can
imagine sometimes it might be a little trickier like for a leg
although there have been leg boxes that have been developed and
arranged for this purpose. And what was remarkable is that they could
finish these experiments and have the patient, the person enter a
state of relaxation, reduced the pain in the phantom limb, and it
would stay there even though, of course, as they exited the mirror
box, they would go about their life and use their intact limb for its
various purposes. I love this experiment because it really speaks to
the subjective nature of pain and pleasure. It speaks to the power of
the visual system, like what we see just like the nail through the
boot experiment. What we see profoundly impacts our experience of
pleasure and pain in this case pain. Now, there's another aspect to
the phantom limb experience and of these maps, the so-called
homunculus maps in the cortex that Ramachandran worked on, which has
very interesting and reveals the degree to which these maps are
plastic or can change in response to experience. Turns out that
because of the locations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=3488"&gt;Sensing Disparate Body Parts As Merged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of different body part representations within these maps, certain
parts of our body that normally we don't think of as related can start
to create merged experiences. What do I mean by that? Well,
Ramchandran described a patient who had a somewhat odd experience of
having lost their foot. So they actually had their foot amputated
about midway up the Achilles. So lower portion of the calf and foot. I
don't recall what the reason was for having it removed. And
fortunately for this patient, they did not experience pain in that
portion of their body, but rather they confided in him that whenever
they would have sex, they would experience their orgasm in their
phantom foot in addition to in their genitals, of course. And
Ramachandra understood the homunculus map. And he understood that this
was because the representation of the foot within the homunculus
actually lies adjacent to, and is somewhat interdigitated with it
actually kind of merges with the representation of the genitalia. Now
that's a weird situation. And yet you now know that the density of
innovation of the feet and the genitalia, as well as the lips and the
face are actually the highest sensory innervation that you have in
your entire body. And this speaks to, I think, a more important
general principle for all people of the experience of pleasure or
pain, which is that an aspect of our pain or pleasure can be highly
localized. It can be because of a cut to a particular location on the
body or it can because of a fall injury or a kind of bruise on one
side of our body. And yet our experience of pleasure and pain can also
be an almost a body-wide experience. And yet it's always most rich.
It's always most heightened in these regions of our body that have
dense sensory innervation. So we experience pain and pleasure
according to local phenomenon receptors in the skin, and this
homunculus map that has all these different territories, but because
of the way that those territories are related, this kind of wild
example of somebody experiencing orgasm in their phantom foot speaks
to the larger experience. The more typical rather experience that I
should say that all people have, which is that pleasure can be body-
wide or we can experience it in our face or the bottoms of our feet
and other areas of the body that we experience pleasure and similarly
with pain. And that brings us to the topic of whole body pain, not
just localized pain, as well as whole body pleasure not just localized
pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=3660"&gt;Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of examples of whole body pain that people suffer
from. And one common one is called fibromyalgia. I want to just first
share with you a little bit of medical insight. A few months back, I
did an Instagram live with Dr. Sean Mackey who's an MD medical doctor
and a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine that was recorded and placed
on my Instagram. If you want to check it out, we can provide a link to
that in the show notes. Dr. Mackey is the Chief of the Division of
Pain at Stanford School of Medicine. So he's a scientist. He studies
pain and he treats patients dealing with various forms of pain, whole
body pain, like fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera. And he shared
with me something very interesting, which is that anytime you hear or
see the word syndrome, that means the medical establishment does not
understand what's going on. A syndrome is a constellation of symptoms
that point in a particular direction or some general set of directions
about what could be going on, but it doesn't reveal a true underlying
disease necessarily. It could be aggregative diseases or it could be
something else entirely. And I want to make sure that I emphasize the
so-called psychosomatic phenomenon. I think sometimes we hear
psychosomatic and we interpret that as meaning all in one's head. But
I think it's important to remember that everything is neural, whether
that's pain in your body 'cause you have a gaping wound and you're
hemorrhaging out of that wound or whether or not it's pain for which
you cannot explain it on the basis of any kind of injury. It's all
neural. So saying body, brain, or psychosomatic it's kind of
irrelevant. And I hope someday we move past that language.
Psychosomatic is interesting. There was a paper that was published in
2015, and then again in 2020 a different paper focused on the so-
called psychogenic fevers or psychosomatic effects. I just briefly
want to mention this because it relates back to pain. These studies
have shown that there are areas of the so-called thalamus, which
integrates and filter sensory information of different kinds. And
within the brainstem, an area called the DMH and I can also provide a
link to this study if you like, that shows that there is a true
neurological basis. There are brain areas and circuits that are
related to what's called psychogenic fever when we are stressed. And
in particular, if we think that we were injured or that we were
infected by something, we can actually generate a true fever. It is
not an imagined fever. It is our thinking generating an increase in
body temperature. And so this has been called psychosomatic. It's been
called psychogenic, but it has a neural basis. So when we hear
syndrome and a patient comes into a clinic and says that they suffer
for instance, from something which is very controversial frankly like
chronic fatigue syndrome, some physicians believe that it reflects a
real underlying medical condition, others don't. However, syndrome
means we don't understand. And that doesn't mean something doesn't
exist. Fibromyalgia or whole body pain for a long time was written off
or kind of explained away by physicians and scientists frankly, my
community as one of these syndromes. It couldn't be explained.
However, now there is what I would consider and I think others would
and should consider from understanding of at least one of the bases
for this whole body pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=3880"&gt;Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's activation of a particular cell type called glial. And
there's a receptor on these glial for those of you that want to know
called the toll 4 receptor and activation of the toll 4 receptor is
related to certain forms of whole body pain and fibromyalgia. Now,
what treatments exist for fibromyalgia. And even if you don't suffer
from fibromyalgia, and even if you don't know anyone who does this is
important information because what I'm about to tell you relate to how
you and your body, which is you of course can deal with pain of any
kind. And there are actually things that one can do and take that can
encourage nerve health in general. In other conditions like diabetic
neuropathy, but in all individuals. So there are clinical data using a
prescription drug. This is work that actually was done by Dr. Mackey
and colleagues. The drug is called naltrexone. Naltrexone is actually
used for the treatment of various opioid addictions and things of that
sort, but it turns out that a very low dose, I believe it was a one
10th the size of the typical dose of naltrexone has been shown to have
some success in dealing with and treating certain forms of
fibromyalgia. And it has that success because of its ability to bind
to and block these toll four receptors on glial. So this so-called
syndrome or this thing that previously was called a syndrome,
fibromyalgia actually has a biological basis. It was not just
inpatients heads. And I really tip my hat to the medical establishment
including Dr. Mackey and others who explored the potential underlying
biologies of things like fibromyalgia and are starting to arrive at
treatments. Now, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor, so I'm not
prescribing anything. You should talk to your doctor of course, if you
have fibromyalgia or other forms of chronic or whole body pain to
explore whether or not these low dose naltrexone treatments are right
for you. But I think it's a beautiful case study if you will, not a
case study of an individual patient, but a case in study of linking up
the patient's self-report of these experiences and using science to
try to establish clinical treatments. There's another treatment, or I
should say there's another approach that one could take. And again,
I'm not recommending people do this necessarily. You have to determine
what's right and say for you, I cannot do that. There's no way your
situation's very far too much, and it would be outside of my
wheelhouse to prescribe anything, but there's a particular compound
which in the United States is sold over the counter and in Europe is
prescription. It's one that I've talked about on this podcast before
for other purposes. And that compound is acetylcarnitine.
Acetylcarnitine as I mentioned is by prescription in most countries in
Europe and the US you can buy this over the counter. There is evidence
that acetylcarnitine can reduce the symptoms of chronic whole body
pain and other certain forms of acute pain at dosages of somewhere
between one to three and sometimes four grams per day. Now
acetylcarnitine can be taken orally. It's found in 500 milligram
capsules, as well as by injection. By injection in the States in the
United States that is also requires a prescription or requires a
prescription I should say. The over-the-counter forms are generally
capsules or powders. Those apparently do not require a prescription.
There are several studies exploring acetylcarnitine in this context,
as well as for diabetic neuropathy. And what's interesting about
acetylcarnitine is it's one of the few compounds that isn't just used
for the treatment of pain, but has also been shown in certain contacts
to improve peripheral nerve health generally. And for that reason,
it's an interesting compound. I've also talked about acetylcarnitine
on here previously, because it has robust effects on things like spur
motility and health, including the speeds at which sperms swim, how
straight they swim turns out that swimming for sperm is more efficient
if they swim straight, as opposed to like those kids in on the swim
team, they're like banging up against the lane lines and zigzagging
all over the place. So it does turn out to be the case that the
quickest route between any two places is a straight line and the good
sperm know that, and the less good sperm don't seem to know that. And
acetylcarnitine seems to facilitate straight swimming trajectories as
well as speed of swimming and overall sperm health. And there is
evidence from quality peer reviewed studies showing that
acetylcarnitine supplementation can also be beneficial for women's
fertility in ways that it affects perhaps we don't really know the
mechanism, health and status of the egg or egg implantation. There are
a large number of studies on acetylcarnitine. You can look those up on
Pub Med, if you like, or on examine.com. There are some studies that I
don't think are included there which are particularly interesting. One
that I just would like to reference the last name of the first author
is Mahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I. The title of the paper is Effects of l
-Carnitine Supplementation on Serum Inflammatory Markers and Matrix
Metalloproteinases Enzymes in Females with Knee Osteoarthritis. So
this is a randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot study that
showed really interesting effects of short term supplementation of
acetylcarnitine. Longer term, the effects were less impressive. So
it's pretty interesting that this compound has so many different
effects. How could it have these effects? Well, it appears that it's
having these effects through its impact on the so-called inflammatory
cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines for those of you that don't know are
secreted by the immune system in response to different stressors,
physical stressors, mental stressors too food that you eat that isn't
good for you. The so-called hidden sugars. Yes, will increase
inflammation if they're ingested too often, or in amounts that are too
high in quantity. Things like Interleukin 1 beta, things like
C-reactive protein, things like interleukin 6. Interleukin 6 is kind
of the generic inflammatory marker that all studies refer to. And yet
there are other interleukins, please note that there are other
interleukins like interleukin 10 that are anti-inflammatory. So immune
system can secrete inflammatory molecules to deal with wounds and
stress and things. And in the short term that's good, and in the
longterm that's bad. And it can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines
like IL10. And these matrix metalloproteinases, it's kind of a
mouthful, but these matrix metalloproteinases are very interesting.
Anytime you see A-S-E, ASE that's generally an enzyme, which means
that these compounds in this case, these matrix metalloproteinases are
used to break down certain elements around wounds and scoring which
might sound like a bad thing, but in some cases is good because it
allows certain cells like glial cells so-called microglia to come in
like low ambulances, like low paramedics and clean up wounds. So
scarring and inflammation is kind of a double-edged sword. It can be
good, but too much scarring. If it contains a wound too much, doesn't
allow the infiltration of cell types to move in and take care of that
wound and heal it up. So it appears that L-carnitine is impacting a
number of different processes, both to impact pain and perhaps, and I
want to underscore perhaps, but there are good studies happening now,
perhaps accelerate wound healing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=4344"&gt;Protocol 6: Agmatine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as we're talking about acute pain and chronic pain and
supplementation and non-prescription drugs, at least in the United
States that people can take to deal with pain of various kinds, I'd be
remiss if I didn't mention the two that I get asked most often about,
which are agmatine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is sometimes
called SAMe. Both of those have been shown to have some impact
categorized on examine as notable impact on various forms of pain, due
to osteoarthritis, or due to injury of various kinds of indifferent
subject population, men, women, people of different ages, et cetera.
SAMe in particular has been interesting because it's been shown head
to head with drugs like Naproxen and other drugs of that sort, which
are well established and sold over the counter in the US to work at
least as well as some of those compounds at certain doses. But it's
also shown that SAMe and some of those things take more time in order
to have those effects. In fact, head to head with things like Neproxin
have been shown that they can take up to a month in order to have the
pain relieving effect. Now, whether or not that makes them a better
choice or a worst choice really depends on your circumstances. I'm
certainly not recommending that anybody take anything, but I do think
it's interesting and important to point out that things like agmatine,
things like SAMe have been shown under certain circumstances to be
beneficial for pain and they are outside the realm of prescription
drugs. I think this is a growing area of some people call them
supplements, some people call them nutraceuticals. Look, at the end of
the day these are compounds that affect cellular processes. And the
more that we understand how they affect those cellar processes as we
now do for things like acetylcarnitine, I think the more trust that we
can put into them, or the more to which we might want to avoid them
because of some of the side effects or contra-indications that those
compounds could have. If you're interested in those other compounds, I
do invite you as I always do to check out examine.com, but also to do
your research on those compounds by simply putting them into Google or
putting them into PubMed, which would be even better. And if you are
going to go into PubMed, if you're going to start playing scientist,
which I do encourage you to do, I would encourage you to not just read
abstracts, but if you can, if the studies are freely available, I
realized not all of them are freely available to try and read those
studies at least to the extent that you can. There's a particularly
nice study that you might look at that was published in 2010 in Pain
Medicine, which is Keynan et al K-E-Y-N-A-N, which looked at the
safety and efficacy of dietary agmatine sulfate on lumbar disc
associated radiculopathy not laughing at the condition. It's a painful
condition that describes a, it's a kind of a range of symptoms that
relate to pinching of nerves. The spinal columns, I was laughing at my
pronunciation of it. That particular study is quite good. And the
conclusion of that study that they drew was that there were limited
side effects and that dietary agmatine sulfate is safe and efficacious
for treating and alleviating pain and improving quality of life and
lumbar-disc associated pain. However, there were very specific dosage
regimens that were described there and duration of treatment. And so
you should not take anything that I say or that study to mean that you
can just take this stuff willy-nilly or at any concentration of
course, or dose. You always want to pay attention to what the science
says. That paper fortunately is freely available online. And we will
also provide a link to that study. For those of you that are
interested in SAMe and its usage for the treatment of various types of
pain, and perhaps other benefits, a number of companies have stopped
making SAMe instead what they're now focusing on is what they think is
a better or more bioavailable alternative, which is
5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 5-MTHF. This molecule is necessary for
converting homocysteine to methionine, which is then converted to SAMe
so rather than taking SAMe directly, the idea is to take something
that's upstream of SAMe and make more SAMe endogenously available.
This is a different strategy. I've talked about this strategy before
for increasing other things like growth hormone, et cetera. There's
always this question of whether or not in trying to increase the
amount of a particular molecule in the body, whether or not taking
that specific molecule was the best thing or working further upstream
as it's referred to working on the precursor or increasing the levels
of the precursor is the better way to go. It appears that this 5-MTHF
is the strategy that people are now taking in place of taking SAMe
directly. So in other words, they're taking this in order to get
elevated levels of SAMe. Now, I'd like to turn our attention to a
completely non drug, non supplement related approach to dealing with
pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=4647"&gt;Acupuncture: Mechanism, Non-Responders, Itch &amp;amp; Inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's one that has existed for thousands of years. And that only
recently has the Western scientific community started to pay serious
attention to, but they have started to pay serious attention to it.
And there is terrific mechanistic science to now explain how and why
acupuncture can work very well for the treatment of certain forms of
pain. Now, first off, I want to tell you what was told to me by our
director or Chief of the Pain Division at Stanford School of Medicine,
Dr. Sean Mackey, which was that some people respond very well to
acupuncture and others do not. And the challenge is identifying who'll
respond well and who won't respond well. Now, when I say won't respond
well, that doesn't necessarily mean that they responded in a negative
way, that it was bad for them, but it does appear that a fraction of
people experienced tremendous pain relief from acupuncture and others
experience none at all or very little to the point where they have to
seek out other forms of treatment. The science on this is still
ongoing. There was actually an excellent paper published on this in
the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the premier
medical clinical journals. And it basically reinforced the idea that
you have responders and non-responders. A number of laboratories have
started to explore how acupuncture works. And one of the premier
laboratories for this is Qiufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School.
Qiufu has spent many years studying the pain system and a system
that's related to the pain system, which is the system that controls
our sensation of itch. Just as a brief aside about itch, itch and pain
are often co associated with one another. I was recently in Texas, and
I will tell you, they have some mean mosquitoes. They're small, but
whatever they're injecting into your skin. Well, here I am talking now
about my subjective experience of pain, whatever they injected into my
skin felt to me like the most extreme mosquito bites I've ever had,
not while they were biting me, not while they were injecting the
venom, but boy, those Texas mosquitoes make me itch. How do they do
it? Well, their venom creates little packets of so-called histamine
that travel around those packets are called mast cells, little packets
of histamine that go to that location and make me and presumably you
want to scratch those mosquito bites. I scratch mine you scratch
yours, but we both scratch our mosquito bites. And when we do that,
the histamines are released. That gets red and inflamed and the itch
even worse. The inflammation is actually caused by the histamine.
Well, that experience of inflammation and pain and itch is what we
call a pyrogenic experience. So we we have pain which is nociception,
essentially, I know that the pain of aficionado always get a little
upset because they say, oh, there's no such thing as as a pain
receptor, it's no susceptive receptors and pain is subjective
experience. Yes, I acknowledge all that. But for fluency, let's just
think about pain as a certain experience and itch as a separate
experience, but they often exist together because those mosquito bites
were what I would call painful, or at least not pleasant. They didn't
just itch, they were also painful nuts because itch brings with it
inflammation and inflammation often brings with it pain relief, but it
can also bring with it the sensation of pain. So itch and pain are two
separate phenomenon. It was actually discovered through a really
interesting phenomenon that relates to something that is actually
consumed in supplement form, which is this tropical legume. It's
actually a bean called Mucuna pruriens. That's M-U-C-U-N-A that's one
word P-R-U-I-E-N-S Mucuna pruriens is a bean, it's as legume that this
bean is 99% L-DOPA. It's dopamine or rather it's the precursor to
dopamine and people buy this stuff and take it over the counter as
ways to increase their levels of dopamine. It does make you feel
really dopamine doubt, meaning it makes you feel a little high and
really motivated and really energetic a lot like other drugs that will
do that. I don't necessarily recommend taking Mucuna pruriens. I
personally don't like taking it. Doesn't make me feel good. I crash
really hard when I take it. But on the outside of this bean is a
compound that makes people itch. So they remove this when you take it
in supplement form. In fact, it's usually in capsule form, but the
outside of this bean, it's like a hairy bean. And those little hairs
contain a compound, which was actually used to study and identify
these itchy receptors in the skin. So we don't have time to go into
all the details of itch, but it's pretty interesting that you have
these compounds out in nature that can make us itch. Inside them they
have dopamine. I mean, this is really weird, but plant compounds are
really powerful. So don't let anyone tell you that because something's
from a plant or an earth that it's not powerful. There are very
powerful plant and herb compounds. Mucuna prurien being one of them
with dopamine on the inside and itchy stuff on the outside. Now, what
does this all have to do with acupuncture? Well, Qiufu Ma's lab has
not just identified the itch pathway, this pruritus genes as they're
called, which causes itch and the pyrogenic phenomenon of itch being
separate from pain. His lab has also studied how acupuncture causes
relief of, but also can exacerbate pain. Now, the form of acupuncture
that they explored was one that's commonly in use called
electroacupuncture. So this isn't just putting little needles into
different parts of the body. These needles are able to pass an
electrical current, not magically, but because they have a little wire
going back to a device and you can pass electrical current. Here's
what they found. This is a study published in the journal neuron Cell
Press journal, excellent journal, very high stringency. So what Qiufu
Ma's lab found was that if electroacupuncture is provided to the
abdomen, to the stomach area, it creates activation of what are called
the sympathetic ganglia. These have nothing to do with sympathy in the
emotional sense has to do with the stress response. Sympa just means
together. So it activated a bunch of neurons along the spinal cord.
And the activation of these neurons evolves neural adrenaline and
something called NPY neuropeptide Y. The long and short of it is that
stimulating the abdomen with electroacupuncture was either anti-
inflammatory or it could cause inflammation. It could actually
exacerbate inflammation depending on whether or not it was of low or
high intensity. Now that makes it a very precarious technique. And
this may speak to some of the reason why some people report relief
from acupuncture and others do not. However, they went a step further
and stimulated other areas of the body using electroacupuncture. And
what they found is that stimulation of the legs of the hind limbs, as
it's called an animals, and the legs in humans caused a circuit, a
neural circuit to be activated that goes from the legs up to an area
of the base of the brain called the DMV not the DMH, which I mentioned
earlier, but the DMV like you go to the DMV, which is a miserable
experience for most people, forgive me, DMV employees, but let's be
honest most people don't enjoy going to the DMV as patrons, but we
have to so we go. The DMV and low intensity stimulation, this
electroacupuncture of the hind limbs activated the DMV and activated
the adrenal glands, which sit at top of your kidneys and cause the
release of what are called catecholamines. And those were strongly
anti-inflammatory. In other words, electroacupuncture of the legs and
feet can, if done correctly, be anti-inflammatory and reduce symptoms
of pain. And can we think accelerate wound healing because activations
of these catecholaminergic pathways can accelerate wound healing as
well. So the takeaway from this is that while there are thousands of
years and millions of subjects involved in explorations of
electroacupuncture and acupuncture, Western medicine is starting to
come into this and start to explore underlying mechanism. Now, for
those of you that love acupuncture and are real proponents of it, it's
worked for you, you might say, well, why does Western medicine even
need to come into this? Why should they even be exploring this? But we
should all be relieved that they are because what's starting to happen
now is that as the mechanistic basis for this is starting to come to
light, insurance coverage of things like acupuncture is starting to
emerge as well. And this is in contrast to other therapies for which
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence, but very little mechanistic
understanding. One example of that would be laser photo biomodulation
the use of lasers of different types really to treat pain and to
accelerate wound healing. A lot of people claim that this can really
help them. However, most places, at least in the States, won't cover
this with insurance or don't perform this in standard clinics. And the
reason is the underlying mechanism isn't known. I'm not going to get
into the argument about whether or not mechanistic understanding
should or should not be required in order to have insurance coverage
of things that work. That's not what this is about. And that actually
will be a boring discussion because I'm shouting at a tunnel through
you. And I wouldn't be able to hear you shout back no matter what your
stance on that is, but just trust me when I say that I am both
relieved and delighted to hear that excellent medical institutions
like Stanford are starting to think about electroacupuncture and how
it can work. That places like Harvard Medical School are starting to
explore this at a mechanistic level. And I do believe that there's an
open-mindedness that starting to emerge for instance, the National
Institutes of Health, not only has an institute for mental health and
cancer research and an eye institute, but now complementary health,
the so-called NCCIH. National Institutes of Complementary Health that
is exploring things like electroacupuncture, meditation, various
supplements and things of those sort. I do think that we're entering a
new realm in which things like pain and pain management will be met
with more openness by all physicians, at least that's my hope. So
please take that into consideration right now. The mechanistic
evidence for laser photobiomodulation is not strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=5300"&gt;Laser Photobiomodulation, Protocol 7: Hypnosis (reveri.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major issues or the barriers to that is that most of the
studies that are out there were actually paid for by companies that
build devices for laser photobiomodulation. And so we really need
independent studies funded by federal institutions that have no bias
or financial relationship in order to gain trust in whatever data
happen to emerge. There is a technique that at one time was considered
alternative, but now has a lot of mechanistic science to explain how
it works, and it does indeed work for the treatment of chronic and
also for acute pain. And that treatment is hypnosis in particular
self-hypnosis. Now, my colleague at Stanford in fact, my collaborator,
Dr. David Spiegel, our Associate Chair of Psychiatry has devoted his
professional life to developing hypnosis tools that people can use to
help them sleep better, focus better, stay motivated, et cetera. While
most people hear hypnosis and they think, oh, this is stage hypnosis.
People walking around like chickens are being forced to laugh or fall
asleep on command, et cetera. This is completely different than all
that. This is self hypnosis and there are now dozens, if not more
quality peer reviewed studies published in excellent journals done by
Dr. Spiegel and others at other universities. It really all has to do
with how self-hypnosis can modulate activity of the prefrontal cortex
and related structures like the insula. The prefrontal cortex is
involved in our executive function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=5400"&gt;Protocol 8: Pressure-Based Pain Relief, “Gate Theory of Pain (Relief)”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it's called, our planning, our decision making, but also how we
interpret context, what the meaning of a given sensation is. And
that's extremely powerful. I just want to remind everybody that the
currency of the brain and body has not changed in hundreds of
thousands of years. It's always been dopamine, serotonin, glutamate,
GABA, testosterone, estrogen. What's changed are the contingencies,
the events in the world that drive whether or not we get an increase
or decrease in testosterone or estrogen, the events in the world that
dictate whether or not we get an increase or a decrease in dopamine.
Believe me, the events that drove those increases and decreases were
very different even a 100 years ago than they are now. And as we
create new things and societies change, et cetera, they will continue
to exchange information in the same currency, which is dopamine,
serotonin, and all these other neuromodulators and chemicals. Hypnosis
takes advantage of this by allowing an individual, you, if you like to
change the way that you interpret particular events and to actually
experience what would be painful as less painful or not painful. And
that's just the example of pain. Hypnosis is powerful for other
reasons too. It actually can help rewire neural circuits so that you
don't experience as much pain so that you can sleep faster, focus
faster. If this is all sounding very fantastical well, it's supported
by data. The data are that when people do self-hypnosis even brief
self-hypnosis of 10 or 15 minutes, a few times a week, maybe even
returned to that hypnosis by just using a one minute a day hypnosis,
they can achieve significant and often very impressive degrees of pain
relief in chronic pain whether or not that chronic pain arises through
things like fibromyalgia or through other sources. If you want to
check this out, there's a wonderful zero cost resource that's grounded
in this work. It's the app reveri.com. So R-E-V-E-R-I.com. There you
can download a zero cost app for Apple phones or for Android phones.
And there are a variety of different hypnosis scripts. These are
actually self hypnosis scripts, and you'll actually hear Dr. David
Spiegel talking to you. He can teach you about hypnosis and how it
works. There are links to scientific studies that web address that I
gave you before reveri.com. You can see the various studies and the
various write-ups related to those studies and how this all works. And
they're simple protocols. You just click on a tab and you listen to
the self-hypnosis and it will take you into hypnosis. And several of
those hypnosis grips have been shown clinically to relieve certain
patterns of chronic pain. So it's a powerful tool, and I encourage you
not to write off the non-drug non supplement tools as less than
powerful because indeed many people experience tremendous relief from
them. And of course, they also can be combined with drug treatments if
that's right for you or with supplements and things of that sort to
treat pain, if that's right for you. So again, electroacupuncture now
often supported by insurance, not always, but often. Great mechanistic
data starting to emerge. Hypnosis, terrific tool. There's even the
self-hypnosis tool that one can access through the zero cost app
Reveri and lots of great clinical data and scientific mechanistic
data. There are neuro imaging studies showing that different brain
areas are activated in hypnosis the so-called default network, kind of
where your brains is kind of idols and the different circuits that are
active in at rest shift with hypnosis and shift long-term in ways that
positively conserve you. And then these things like laser
photobiomodulation still more or less in that experimental medical
community. I should say, Western Medical Community, not so certain,
but hopefully there will be data soon, and hopefully those data will
point to mechanisms that allow the insurance companies and other sort
of medical bodies to support them if indeed they have a mechanistic
basis. I just want to briefly touch on a common method of pain relief
that speaks to a more general principle of how things like
electroacupuncture, and also some of these new emerging techniques of
kind of like active tissue release and this principle that you hear a
lot about in sports medicine now that when you have pain or injury at
one site, that you should provide pressure above and below that site.
You may have seen this in the Olympics, which is ongoing now where
people will put tape on their body at certain locations oftentimes.
The logic or what they're saying is that this is designed to create
relief in a joint or in a limb that's below the tape, not necessarily
under the tape, but above or below. So for instance, if there's pain
in one shoulder, sometimes we'll put it on the trapezius muscle or
things of that sort. It turns out that there is a basis for this
because of the way that these different nerves run in from the skin
and from the muscles up into the spinal cord and into the brainstem
providing pressure on one nerve pathway can often impact another
pathway. And the simplest and most common example of this is one that
we all do instinctually or intuitively even animals do this. This is
something that in the textbooks is all is called the Gate Theory of
Pain developed by Melzack and Wall kind of classic theory. Basically
we have receptors in our skin, the so-called C fibers, that's just a
name for these little wires that come from a particular class of DRGs
that's very thin that brings about certain kinds of nasal scepter
information. I want to say pain information, but then the pain people
believe are not their pain people. Sometimes they're a pain because
what they tell me is they're on pain receptors okay, nociceptors That
information comes in C fibers and what happens when we injure
something well, provided that we won't damage it worse by touching it,
oftentimes what we will do is we will rub the source of pain or the
location in which we were experiencing pain. And it turns out that's
not an unuseful thing to do. When we rub our skin or an area, or we
provide pressure nearby it, we activate the so-called A fibers, the
bigger wires and neurons that innovate, meaning they jut into that
area of skin. And those A fibers, the ones that respond to mechanical
pressure actually are able to inhibit those C fibers, the ones that
are carrying that so-called pain information. So rubbing an area or
providing pressure above or below an injury actually provides real
pain relief support for the location of that injury or that pain
because of the way that these different patterns or these different
types of neurons interact with one another. And when I say it inhibits
it, I don't mean that it like shouts at it, what it does is it
releases it's literally kind of like vomits up a little bit of a
neurotransmitter called GABA. And GABA is a neurotransmitter that
inhibits it quiets the activity of other neurons. And so it's acting
as kind of an analgesic, if you will, it's acting as its own form of
drug that you make with your body to quiet the activity of these pain
neurons. So rubbing a wound provided it doesn't damage the wound worse
or providing pressure above or below typically it's above a particular
injury can have a real effect in relieving some of the pain of that
injury. And some people have speculated this as through fascia, or
this is through other bodily organs and tissues. And it might be we're
going to do a whole episode on fascia. It's extremely interesting
tissue, but right now it seems that the main source of that pain
relief is through this A fiber inhibition of these C fibers so-called
Melzack and Wall Gate Theory of Pain if you'd like to look it up and
learn about that further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=5873"&gt;Redheads &amp;amp; Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's talk about a phenomenon that has long intrigued and
perplexed people for probably thousands of years. And that's redheads.
You may have heard before that redheads have a higher pain threshold
than other individuals. And indeed, that is true. There's now a study
that looked at this mechanistically. There's a gene called the MC1R
gene. And this MC1R gene encodes for a number of different proteins.
Some of those proteins of course are related to the production of
melanin. This is why redheads often not always, but often are very
fair skinned. Sometimes have freckles, not always. And of course have
red hair. Some people are really intense ginger's not psychologically
or emotionally intense perhaps that too, but meaning their hair is
very, very red. Others, it's a lighter red. So of course there's
variation here, but this gene, this MC1R gene is associated with a
pathway that relates to something that I've talked about on this
podcast before during the episode on hunger and feeding and this is
POMC. POMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin and POMC is cut up. It's
cleaved into different hormones, including one that enhances pain
perception. This is melanocyte stimulating hormone. And another one
that blocks pain beta endorphin. Now, if you listen to the episodes on
testosterone and estrogen and the episodes on hunger and feeding, some
of these molecules will start to ring a bell. Things like melano
stimulating hormone relate to pigmentation of the skin relate to
sexual arousal, et cetera, but it turns out that in red heads, because
of the fact that they have this gene, this MC1R gene, the POMC Pro-
opiomelanocortin, that's cut into different hormones, melanocyte-
stimulating hormones and another one beta endorphin. Beta endorphin
should cue you to the fact that this is in the pain pathway. The
endorphins are endogenously made, meaning made within our body
opioids. They actually make us feel numb in response to certain kinds
of pain. Now, not completely numb, but they numb or reduce our
perception of pain because of the ways in which they are released from
certain brain centers. We'll talk about those brain centers in a
moment. So what's really interesting is that this study showed that
the presence of these hormones is in everybody. We all have
melanocortin 4, we all have beta endorphins. We all have POMC et
cetera, but red heads make more of these endogenous endorphins. And
that's interesting. It allows them to buffer against the pain
response. I have a personal anecdote to share with you about this red
head and heightened levels of pain tolerance phenomenon. Obviously I'm
not a redhead. I don't dye my hair, but my partner for many years was
a red head and still is a red head. She had bright red hair and had
that since childhood. Well, we had the fortunate experience of
becoming friends with Wim Hof and family. They actually came out to
visit us and did a series of seminars in the bay area. This was in
2016, as I recall. And my partner, she had never done an ice bath. She
had never done any kind of real cold water exposure experience before,
but as one particular gathering as is often the case when women's
around, there was an ice bath and a number of people were getting into
this thing. This was actually before a dinner event. And I think for
most people who have never done an ice bath getting in for 30 seconds
or a minute is tolerable, but it takes some effort. It takes some
willpower and take some overcoming that pain barrier 'cause it is a
little bit painful. Not a lot. Some people can stay in longer three
minutes, five minutes without much discomfort. What was incredible is
that without any desire to compete with anybody else, my partner
redhead got into the ice bath and just like sat there for 10 minutes.
In fact, at one point she just kind of turned to me and said, "I don't
really feel pain. I'm not really in pain." And Wim loved this. Wim
thought it was great. He thought it was the most terrific thing in the
world. And he got back in the ice bath and they became fast friends,
and I think they're probably still fast friends. So in any event,
that's an end of one. What we call an anecdata example. Anecdata is
not really a term that we should use too much 'cause it's N of one
anecdotes are just that. They're just anecdotes. But it's been
described many times in various clinics by anesthesiologists, by
observation of coaches, et cetera, that redheads men and women who are
redheads seem to have this higher pain threshold. And it does seem to
be because their body naturally produces ways to counter the pain
response. They produce their own endogenous opioids. Now this of
course should not be taken to mean that redheads can tolerate more
pain and therefore should be subjected to more pain, all it means is
that their threshold for pain on average, not all of them, but on
average is shifted higher than that of other individuals. And it
remains to be determined whether or not other light skin, light haired
individuals also have a heightened level of pain threshold. And I
should mention because I mentioned the ice bath that of course pain
threshold is something that can be built up and provide you do that
safely in ways that aren't damaging your tissues because of course,
pain is a signal that is designed to help you to keep from harming
yourself, but provided that you can do that in a way that's safe and
doesn't damage your tissues, increasing your pain threshold through
the use of things like ice baths is something that really can be done.
It has a lot to do with these contextual or top-down modulations of
the experience. You can tell yourself that this is good for me, or I'm
doing this by choice or whatever it is. You can distract yourself.
There are a huge number of different ways that one could do that. One
of the more interesting ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=6242"&gt;Protocol 8: Love &amp;amp; Pain, Dopamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for which there are actually really good scientific data come from my
colleagues, Sean Mackey's Lab. And that actually looked at how love
and in particular, the experience of obsessive love could actually
counter the pain response, not just in redheads, but in everybody. So
that study I'll just briefly describe it involved having people come
into the laboratory and experience any one or a number of different
painful stimuli, but they had selectively recruited subjects that were
in new relationships for which there was a high degree of infatuation
so much so that the people couldn't stop thinking about or
communicating with that new partner up to 80% of their waking time,
which is a lot. That constant obsessing about that partner was
correlated with. It wasn't causal necessarily, but was correlated with
the ability to sustain higher levels of pain than people who were in
more typical non obsessive forms of love, longstanding relationships,
where there wasn't long obsessive love rather. And of course in this
study, there were a lot of good control groups. They included a
distractor, they included people obsessing about other things, their
pet, et cetera. They included other forms of love and attachment, but
it does seem that certain patterns of thinking can allow us to buffer
ourselves against the pain response. And that should not be
surprising. Certain forms of thinking are associated with the release
of particular neuromodulators in particular dopamine. And dopamine, it
may seem is kind of the thing that underlies everything, but it's not.
Dopamine is a molecule that's associated with novelty expectation,
motivation, and reward. We talked about this at the beginning of the
episode, that it's really the molecule of expectation and motivation
and hope and excitement more than it's associated with the receival of
the reward. Well, dopamine is coursing throughout the brain at
heightened levels and coursing throughout the body at heightened
levels when we fall in love. This probably has some adaptive mechanism
that ensure paired bonding between people or who knows, maybe it
ensured not bonding to multiple people. Nobody really knows how
dopamine functions in terms of pair bonding, but it is known that when
people fall in love, new relationships create very high levels of
dopamine. And that's probably the mechanistic basis by which these
people were able to buffer the pain response by thinking about their
partner or this new relationship that they're in almost obsessively or
obsessively. Now that raises a deeper question we should always be
asking. Yeah, but how, how? Well, the dopamine system can have
powerful effects on the inflammation system. And it doesn't do this
through mysterious ways. It does this by interacting through the
brainstem and some of the neurons that innervate the spleen and other
areas of the body, that deploy cells to go combat infection,
inflammation, and pain. And the ways in which dopamine can modulate
pain, and in this case, this particular study transform our experience
of pain. Maybe even to something that's pleasureful is not mysterious.
It's really through the activation of brainstem neurons that
communicate with areas of our body, that deploy things like immune
cells. So for instance, we have neurons in our brain stem that can be
modulated by the release of dopamine and those neurons in the
brainstem control the release of immune cells from tissues like the
spleen or organs like the spleen. And those immune cells can then go
combat infection. We've heard before that when we're happy, we're
better able to combat infection, deal with pain, deal with all sorts
of things that essentially makes us more resilient. And that's not
because dopamine is some magic molecule, it's because dopamine affects
particular circuits and tells in a very neuro-biological way in a
biochemical way tells those cells and circuits that conditions are
good. Despite the fact that there's pain in the body conditions are
good. You're in love or conditions are good. You want to be in this
experience. Or conditions are good this is for a greater cause that
you're fighting or suffering for some larger purpose. So all of that
has existed largely in the realm of psychology and even motivational
literature in this kind of thing, but there's a real mechanistic basis
for it. Dopamine is a molecule that can bind to receptor sites on
these brain areas. Those brain areas can then modulate the organs and
tissues of the body that can allow us to lean into challenge. And
those challenges can be infection, it can be physical pain, it can be
long bouts of effort that are required of us. And I think many people
have described the feeling of being newly in love as a heightened
level of energy, a capacity do anything. I mean, the whole concept of
a muse is one in which some individual or some thing either imagined
or real enters our life and we can use that as fuel. And that fuel is
chemical fuel and that chemical fuel is dopamine. And it really does
allow for more resilience and can even transform the experience of
pain or what would otherwise be pain into an experience of pleasure.
So, along those lines, let's talk about pleasure. With all the cells
and tissues and machinery related&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=6563"&gt;Pleasure &amp;amp; Reproduction, Dopamine &amp;amp; Serotonin, Oxytocin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to pain, you might think that our entire touch system is designed to
allow us to detect pain and to avoid tissue damage and well, a good
percentage of it is devoted to that. A good percentage of it is also
devoted to this thing that we call pleasure. And that should come as
no surprise. Pleasure isn't just there for our pleasure. It serves
adaptive role, and that adaptive role relates to the fact that every
species has a primary goal which is to make more of itself otherwise
it would go extinct. That process of making more of itself sexual
reproduction is closely associated with the sensation and the
perception of pleasure. And it's no surprise that not only is the
highest density of sensory receptors in and on and around the
genitalia, but the process of reproduction evokes sensations and
molecules and perceptions associated with pleasure. And the currency
of pleasure exists in multiple chemical systems but the primary ones
are the dopamine system, which is the anticipation of pleasure and the
work required to achieve the ability to experience that pleasure, and
the serotonin system which is more closely related to the immediate
experience of that pleasure. And from dopamine and serotonin stem out
other hormones and molecules, things like oxytocin, which are
associated with pair bonding. Oxytocin is more closely associated with
the serotonin system biochemically and at the circuit level meaning
the areas of the brain and body that manufacture a lot of serotonin,
usually not always, but usually contain neurons that also manufacturer
and make use of the molecule oxytocin. Those chemicals together create
sensations of warmth, of well being, of safety. The dopamine molecule
is more closely associated with hormones like testosterone and other
molecules involved with pursuit and further effort in order to get
more of whatever could potentially cause more release of dopamine. So
this is a very broad strokes, no pun intended description of the
pleasure system. There are of course, other molecules as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=6700"&gt;Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor to Tyrosine)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in particular that's very interesting is something called PEA.
PEA, it stands for Phenethylamine sometimes also referred to as
Phenethylamine depending on who you are and where you live, how you
pronounce it doesn't really matter. PEA is a molecule, which is
incredibly potent at augmenting or increasing the activity of certain
cells and neural circuits that relate to the pleasure system. PEA has
purportedly been thought to be released in response to ingestion of
things like certain forms of dark chocolate. Some people take it in
supplement form. It's a bit of a stimulant, but it also seems to
heighten the perception of pleasure in response to a particular amount
of dopamine and or serotonin. So for instance, in a kind of a
arbitrary experiment and units type example, if a given experience
evokes a particular amount of serotonin and dopamine and gives rise to
a subjective experience of pleasure of say level three out of 10, the
ingestion of PEA prior to that experience can increase the rating of
that experience as more pleasureful. Maybe a four or a five, or even a
six. And PEA is known to be present in or I should say it's releases
stimulated by a number of different compounds, such as dark chocolate,
certain things like aspartame and certain people can actually increase
the amount of PEA released. Some of these glutamate related molecules
like aspartame or things are in the glutamate pathway can increase PEA
release. And then some people will actually take PEA in supplement
form for its mild stimulant properties as well as for increasing the
perception of, or the ability to experience pleasure. It's not a
sledgehammer. It's not like dopamine itself. People that take things
like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA or drugs of abuse, which I certainly
don't recommend things like cocaine or amphetamine experience
tremendous increases in dopamine, not so much increases in serotonin.
Some people will take serotonin in precursor form like 5HTP or
serotonin itself, or they'll take the amino acid precursor like
tryptophan. I'm not saying these things as recommendations for
increasingly one sense of pleasure, I'm describing them because of
what they do generally falls into two categories. The first category
is to raise the foundation, what we call the tonic level of dopamine
and serotonin. So if levels of serotonin and dopamine are too low, it
becomes almost impossible to experience pleasure. There's a so-called
anhedonia. This is also described as depression. Although it needn't
be long-term depression. So certain drugs like antidepressants like
Wellbutrin Bupropion as it's commonly called or the so-called SSRI,
the serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft and
similar will increase dopamine and serotonin respectively. They're not
increasing the peaks in those molecules. What we call the acute
release of those molecules, what they're doing is they're raising the
overall levels of those molecules. They're raising the sort of
foundation or the tide if you will, think about it as your mood or
your pleasure rather is like a boat, and if it's on the shore and it
can't get out to sea, unless that tide is high enough, that's kind of
the way to think about these tonic levels of dopamine and serotonin.
Now, most of us fortunately, do not have problems with our baseline or
autonic levels of dopamine and serotonin release. Things like PEA in
that case will cause a slight increase in that tide and make the
ability of certain experiences to increase dopamine further more
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=6940"&gt;Contextual Control of Pleasure by Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we call this in neurosciences so-called gain control. I can kind
of turn up the volume, bring us closer to the threshold to activate
certain circuits. And this is really what we mean when we say a
neuromodulator, okay? This is why when you are very happy about
something, let's say you're out with your friends. You're really
excited. Maybe depending on where you live and what's going on in your
area of the world right now, like I have a niece and she's been locked
up in quarantine for a long time recently because it was deemed safe.
She got to go to summer camp. I have never seen that kid so happy to
spend with her friends. She was so excited and it was really amazing
to see how excited she was. Her baseline levels of dopamine were
clearly up so much so that when she saw her friends, she literally
started squealing. They were squealing, she was squealing. Everyone
was squealing. I wasn't squealing. I would admit it if I was
squealing. I wasn't squealing, but it was such a delight to see and
I'm sure that made my dopamine levels go up, which was, she was just
so excited such that anything and everything felt like an exciting
stimulus. This is pleasure, right? And I don't want to write off the
experience from an neuro-biological reductionist standpoint, quite the
opposite. It's really beautiful to see again this principle that
different experiences and the experience of pleasure from different
things. Seeing your friends for the first time, summer camp for a kid,
whatever it might happen to be use the same currency, dopamine use the
same currency serotonin. And this is a principle that I hope in
listening to this podcast and even some of it's repetitive features
from one episode to the next. I'm hoping that those will start to
embed in your mind that the brain and body use these common currencies
for different experiences. So yes, if your dopamine and serotonin, or
I should say if your dopamine and or serotonin levels are too low, it
will be very hard to achieve pleasure to experience physical pleasure
or emotional pleasure of any kind. That's why treatments of the sort
that I described a minute ago might be right for you. Obviously we
can't determine if they're right for you. It's also why they have side
effects. If you artificially increase these molecules they're
associated with pleasure, oftentimes you get a lack of motivation to
go seek things like food. People don't get much interest in food
'cause why should they if their serotonin levels are already up.
Again, there's a ton of individual variation. I don't want to say that
these antidepressants are always bad. Sometimes they've saved lives.
They've saved millions of lives. Sometimes people have side effects
that make them not the right choice. So it has to be determined for
the individual. Things like PEA or a more subtle effect. I should
mention PEA supplementation is something that a number of people use
but it's very short-lived. Because of the half-life of this molecule
was very brief, the effect only lasts about 20 minutes or so. Things
like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens lead to longer baseline increases in
dopamine. But remember, any time you raise a baseline, you reduce the
so-called signal to noise. What it means is if you're riding around at
really high dopamine, at first, everything will start to seem exciting
like my niece and seeing her friends for the first time. Everything's
exciting. But then what will happen is when your dopamine levels
return to more normal levels, it will take a much greater dopamine
increase of much bigger event, more novel, more exciting in order to
achieve the sense that what you're experiencing is pleasureful. And
this is because of the relationship between pleasure and pain. Now, in
a future episode we are going to go deep into this relationship
between pleasure and pain, but just briefly as a precursor to that and
because it's relevant to the conversation that we've been having, you
might want to be wary of any experience, any experience, no matter how
it arrives, chemical, physical, emotional, or some combination, you
might want to be wary of letting your dopamine go too high and
certainly you want to be wary of it going too low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=7180"&gt;Pleasure-Pain Balance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the way that these circuits adjust. Basically every time
that the pleasure system is kicked in in high gear, an absolutely
spectacular event, you cannot be more ecstatic. There is a mirror
symmetric activation of the pain system. And this might seem like an
evil curse of biology, but it's not. This is actually a way to protect
this whole system of reward and motivation that I talked about at the
beginning of the episode. It might sound great to just ingest
substances or engage in behaviors where it's just dopamine, dopamine,
dopamine, and just constantly be motivated, but the system will
eventually crash. And so what happens is when you have a big increase
in dopamine, you also will get a big increase in the circuits that
underlie our sense of disappointment and re adjusting the balance. And
with repeated exposure to high levels of dopamine, not naturally
occurring wonderful events, but really high chemically induced peaks
in dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks in dopamine.
What happens is those peaks in dopamine start to go down and down and
down in response to the same, what ought to be incredible experience.
We start to what's called habituate or attenuate, and yet the pain
increases in size. And this has a preservative function in keeping us
safe, believe it or not. But what I just described is actually the
basis of most if not all, forms of addiction something that we will
deal with in a future episode in depth. So what should you think about
all? How should you think about pleasure and how should you think
about pain? What is too much pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=7284"&gt;Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine &amp;amp; Motivation Over Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's going to differ from person to person, but to the extent
that one can access pleasure repeatedly over time, ideally without
chemical augmentation, certainly not excessive chemical augmentation,
that means that this pleasure system is tuned up well and can continue
to experience pleasure. However, if you find yourself engaging in the
same behavior over and over again, but achieving less and less
pleasure from it, chances are you want to adjust down how often you
engage in that behavior. And or adjust down your expectation of reward
every time you engage in that behavior. What do I mean by that? Well,
at the beginning of the episode I talked about how dopamine will allow
us to get into bouts of hard work. We will work very hard to pursue a
reward, and that's really what dopamine does. And then when the reward
comes that doesn't increase our dopamine. In fact, our dopamine levels
go down. One of the key things that we can all do to adjust our
ability to experience pleasure is to engage in that intermittent
reward schedule. You can either adjust down the peak in dopamine,
meaning not let yourself ever get too happy, but that's no fun, right?
Life is about occasionally achieving or experiencing ecstasy, but
every once in a while, remove the reward. And of course, I don't mean
ecstasy the drug that's a separate matter. The MDMA trials are a
separate matter. Very interesting, I want to be clear. I meant
psychological and physical ecstasy of the natural sort. I've immense
interest in what's going on in the MDMA trials, but just for clarity
purposes, that's a separate topic that we will cover in an episode
very soon. So how do you adjust this dopamine system? Well, every once
in a while at random, not in a predictable way, you remove the reward
and that will keep you and your dopamine system tune up in the proper
ways. The gain of the dopamine system, as we say, will be adjusted so
that you can continue to experience dopamine and serotonin when you
actually get the reward. This can be translated into a huge number of
different domains, but I want to give some examples because I'm sure
that many of you are asking, wait, what does this actually mean? Okay,
let's say you're a student, or this could be a student in academia, or
this could be a student of a physical practice. Every once in a while
when you do something really well, maybe that's even just showing up
to the practice rather than pat yourself on the back, just tell
yourself yeah, that's the minimum that's expected of me. When
everyone's excited about something that you're doing, maybe you're
excited about it, try and adjust down your excitement a little bit. I
know this might seem counterintuitive, but you're preserving the
ability to experience excitement in a variety of contexts. Let's say
you get a big monetary award. Well, that's great. I'm happy for you.
And that's wonderful. However, you should be a little bit wary if you
care about your dopamine system and you care about your ability to get
subsequent monetary rewards, excuse me, awards rewards doesn't matter
which through effort, if you want to be able to maintain the ability
to exert effort, well, then you probably wouldn't want to run out and
immediately buy something with that monetary reward. In other words,
you wouldn't want to layer on more dopamine release, okay? You might,
but you might not. You might skip it. What you'll find then is that
your motivation is essentially infinite. This is what I described at
the beginning of the episode. And again, it's because dopamine is this
currency. It's like these days you hear a lot about Bitcoin, and
Ethereum, and Dogecoin, and USs dollars, and Euros and other stuff.
But the currency that you use in your body doesn't matter what
external currency those are. In fact, as you watch the value of
different currencies go up whether or not it's cryptocurrency or
standard currency, the value is actually reflective of the dopamine
that exists inside of people. So all the excitement about a particular
currency crypto or otherwise is really just dopamine. That's the
currency that we all use. And there's no negotiating that. That's just
the way that we're built. Now, to give yet other examples. Let's say
you're teaching other people how to do something and they do something
exceptionally well. If you reward them every single time. and in
particular, if you reward them with something that's even greater than
the experience of what they did. So let's say kids win a soccer game
and they're ecstatic. They're jumping all over the place. They're
super excited and you reward them with an even bigger experience, a
celebration, you are actually inhibiting their ability to perform the
same set of activities that led them to the win if, and I really want
to underscore if you reward them every time. Of course we should
reward kids and each other and ourselves for our accomplishments, but
you don't want to do it every time. And sure there will be some
disappointment from suddenly removing the reward that you expected,
but that's exactly the point. That's what keeps these circuits tuned
up properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=7600"&gt;Protocol 11: Immediate, Non-Goal-Directed Pleasure, PAG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there's the other form of pleasure, which is the more immediate
visceral or sensory experience of pleasure. This is distinct from
goals and goal-directed behavior. I'm talking about the immediate
experience. This is more of the serotonergic system. There are other
systems involved too, but this is also the system that draws out those
endogenous opioids from a particular structure. We have a structure in
the back of our brain called PAG P-A-G, it's the periaqueductal gray
area. Very interesting brain area that is associated with pain, but
also with pleasure because under certain conditions, it deploys
endogenous opioids and gives us a kind of blissed out feeling. This is
not like the opioids of the opioid epidemic sort that people take and
unfortunately have led to tremendous amounts of suffering and abuse.
These are endogenously released opioids. These are the kinds of
opioids that come out from long distance bouts of physical exercise
and running. These are the opioids that are deployed in response to
giving birth and overcoming the tremendous pain of childbirth. So PAG
is very contextual and there are few types of stimuli or I should say
events in life... I'm really showing my nerdy side. There are a few
types of stimulate, I'm talking about experiences that evoke
endogenous opioid release from PAG. One is sexual activity. Sexual
activity can increase pain threshold. And here I am not suggesting or
getting involved in anyone's particular proclivities or personal
experiences. You're welcome to editorialize this however you like,
however, what I'm talking about are animal data and yes, human data as
well, that show that pain thresholds are increased anytime PAG is
activated because of the release of these endogenous opioids. There's
also the immediate experience of whether or not a particular form of
touch is pleasureful or not. And there there's some very interesting
biology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=7720"&gt;Direction of Touch: Pleasure Versus Pain, Arousal &amp;amp; Touch “Sensitivity”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that relates to really how those little wires from those DRGs innovate
our skin. Work studies I should say done by David Ginty's lab at
Harvard Medical School, the Ginty lab has spent years working on the
somata sensory system, the touch system has identified a particular
category of neurons that innervate the skin and then those neurons of
course send that information up to the brain too. And they actually
respond to direction of touch. Now, some of you might be more
sensitive to this than others, but it turns out that certain hairs
like to be deflected one way versus another. Whether you like cats or
not, you can do this experiment. You can pet a cat in the direction
that they're fur lies. So it lies down in a particular direction.
You'll notice that there's actually a gene that dictates that the
hairs lie down in a particular direction. And if you pet them in a way
that's co-operating with that direction. So not pushing the hairs up,
but rather stroking the hairs on the back of the cat. Well, you'll
notice as they often like that. Not all cats some cats are pretty
grouchy, but if you stroke their hair, they will often per, they'll
often push into you. If you were to stroke their hair in the opposite
direction, pushing the hairs up against the direction that they want
to lie down, cats do not like that. And it turns out that people don't
like that either. Some people do like to have their hair pushed in a
direction against the direction in which it wants to lay down. But
there is more typically response a feeling like it's pleasureful for
instance, when someone brushes or combs their hair in the direction
that it wants to lay down. And that's because the way in which these
neurons, they innovate these hairs sends information up to the brain
bifurcates actually, it splits into brain centers that evoke a sense
of pleasure or a sense of not pleasure. It's not necessarily pain. So
you might find that certain people are very particular. They like to
be touched in a certain way, but not others. You might be one of those
people. And areas of our skin that have high density of receptors are
very, very sensitive in a real way, in a real sense of the word to
patterns of touch and whether or not a touch is too firm or too light.
And that will be modulated by overall levels of arousal. And when I
talk about arousal, what I'm talking about is how alert or how sleep
we are. It is impossible to experience pain when we are deep in sleep.
I don't mean sleeping like of the typical night's sort. I mean, of the
anesthesia sort. That's the purpose of anesthesia to bring the brain
and body into a deep plane of rest, very deep in fact, and it's very
hard if not impossible to achieve or experience pleasure when we are
in a very low state of arousal as well. When we are in heightened
states of arousal, we can achieve pain, we can experience pain and we
can experience pleasure. And under those heightened states of arousal,
we are more sensitive. Literally the passage of electrical signals
from those locations on the body that have heightened degrees or
higher degrees, I should say of receptors, use your imagination. They
include the lips, the face, the feet, and the genitals and nearby
areas, literally nearby areas. Under conditions of higher arousal two
things happen, the ability to achieve or experience pleasure at those
locations goes up and our tolerance and our threshold for pain also
goes up. So the principle here is that as our levels of arousal, that
foundation of arousal goes up or down, so too goes up and down our
ability to achieve pleasure and pain. And so these two extremes of
being deep within anesthesia or another extreme as asleep or an
heightened levels of arousal, our ability to achieve pleasure and pain
are going to scale according to those. And this is why, and I'm
certainly not suggesting this, but this is why some people will take
stimulants or drugs of abuse that increase arousal in order to achieve
pleasure of other kinds. The problem is is that those drugs in
particular are things like cocaine and methamphetamine and amphetamine
become their own form of reinforcement so much so that the person
doesn't seek out any other form of excitement or arousal. So today we
weren't talking about addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&amp;amp;t=7980"&gt;Synthesis &amp;amp; How to Conceptualize Pain and Pleasure, Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren't necessarily talking about motivation, but we touched on
those topics as sort of a precursor of what's to come. We talked about
the pathways in the skin and in the brain and elsewhere in the body
that control our sense of pleasure and pain. We described a number of
different tools ranging from hypnosis to different supplements, to
electroacupuncture and various other tools that one could use to
modulate your sense of pleasure or pain. And of course, in thinking
about pleasure, we have to think about the dopamine system and the
serotonin system and some of the related chemical systems. I realized
that today's podcast had a lot of scientific details. We've
timestamped everything for you so that you don't have to digest it all
at once of course I don't expect that everyone would be able to
understand all these details all at once. What's more important really
is to understand the general principles of how something like pleasure
and pain work. How they interact, and the very seldom systems within
the brain and body that allow them to occur and that modulator or
change their ability to occur. And of course your subjective
experience of pleasure or pain. So I do hope that this was on hole
more pleasureful than painful for you. If you're enjoying this podcast

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introducing Dr. Matt Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. Today I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Matthew Walker
as our guest on the Huberman Lab podcast. Dr. Walker is a professor of
neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.
There, his laboratory studies sleep. They study why we sleep, what
occurs during sleep, such as dreams and why we dream, learning during
sleep, as well as the consequences of getting insufficient or poor
quality sleep on waking states. Dr. Walker is also the author of the
international best selling book "Why We Sleep". Our discussion today
is an absolutely fascinating one for anyone that's interested in
sleep, learning, or human performance of any kind. Dr. Walker teaches
us how to get better at sleeping. He also discusses naps, whether or
not we should or should not nap, whether or not we can compensate for
lost sleep, and if so how to best do that. We discuss behavioral
protocols and interactions with light, temperature, supplementation,
food, exercise, sex, all the variables that can impact this incredible
state of mind and body that we call sleep. During my scientific
career, I've read many papers about sleep and attended many seminars
about sleep yet my discussion with Dr. Walker today revealed to me
more about sleep, sleep science and how to get better at sleeping than
all of those papers and seminars combined. I'm also delighted to share
that Dr. Walker has started a podcast. That podcast entitled "The Matt
Walker Podcast", releases its first episode this month and is going to
teach all about sleep, and how to get better at sleeping. So be sure
to check out the Matt Walker podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you
listen to podcasts. Before we begin,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=120"&gt;Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Belcampo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort
to bring zero cost of consumer information about science and science
related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd
like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is
ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolutely
highest quality. The company was founded by two all American swimmers
from Stanford and everything about the design of their glasses is with
performance in mind. I've spent my career studying the visual system
and how it works and I can tell you that ROKA glasses take into
account the science of the visual system such that whether or not
you're wearing them on a very bright day, or you walk into a shadowed
area or there's cloud cover, you can still see everything with perfect
clarity. That also reflects the fact that the lenses that they use are
of the absolute highest optical quality. The other terrific thing
about ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses is that they're designed to be
worn in all conditions. You can use them while running, while cycling,
even if you get sweaty, they won't slip off. And they look great. One
problem I have with a lot of so called performance eyeglasses and
sunglasses out there is that they look crazy. They make people look
like cyborgs. ROKA glasses have a terrific aesthetic, you can wear
them to dinner, you can wear them at work, and you can wear them in
all sorts of sports activities. If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you
can go to ROKA, that's roka.com and enter the code Huberman to save
20% off your first order. That's ROKA roka.com and enter the code
Huberman at checkout. Today's podcast is also brought to us by
InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that
analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand
your body and then reach your health goals. I've long been a believer
in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of
the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only
be analyzed from a quality blood test. And nowadays, with the advent
of DNA tests, you can also get insight into your immediate and long
term health by way of understanding your DNA. One issue with many DNA
and blood tests, however, is that you get the numbers back about
metabolic factors, hormones, genes, et cetera, but there's no
directive as to what to do with that information. With InsideTracker,
they have a very easy to use dashboard, and that dashboard not only
gives you your numbers, but it gives you simple directives related to
nutrition, supplementation, exercise and other lifestyle factors that
allow you to move those numbers into the ranges that are right for you
and your health goals. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go
to insidetracker.com/Huberman and if you do that, you'll get 25% off
any of InsideTracker's plans, just use the code Huberman at checkout.
Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo, Belcampo is a
regenerative farm in Northern California that raises organic grass fed
and finished certified humane meats. I don't eat a lot of meat, I eat
meat about once a day, but when I do, I make sure that it's high
quality and both humanely and sustainably raised. Conventionally
raised animals are confined to feedlots and eat a diet of inflammatory
grains, but Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures and seasonal
grasses, resulting in meat that's higher in nutrients and healthy
fats. Now, I've talked many times before on this podcast about how
getting sufficient levels of omega threes is very important for
metabolic health, hormone health, mood, essentially all aspects of
one's health. Belcampo meats have high levels of omega threes, because
of the grasses they feed on. The way Belcampo raises its animals isn't
just better for our health, it also has a positive impact on the
environment. They practice regenerative agriculture, which means that
their meat is climate positive and carbon negative, meaning it's good
for you, and it's good for the environment. You can order Belcampo's
sustainably raised meats to be delivered to you using my code Huberman
by going to belcampo.com/Huberman and if you do that, you'll get 20%
off your first order. I'm a big fan of their keto meatballs I also
really liked their boneless rib eyes, I eat those pretty much once a
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=360"&gt;What Is Sleep?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, that's Huberman for the code. And it's belcampo.com/huberman

Great to finally meet you in person. Wonderful to connect. I mean,
it's been too long, but I suspect it would have been a shorter time
before we'd met lest the pandemic, thank you for coming up. No, thank
you, yeah, I'm delighted that we're finally sitting down face to face.
I've been tracking your work both in the internet sphere, and I read
your book and loved it. And also from the perspective of science, you
actually came to Stanford couple of years ago and gave a lecture for
BrainMind. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And there, of course, you
talked about sleep and its utility and its challenges and how to
conquer it, so to speak. Let's start off very basic, what is sleep?
Sleep is probably the single most effective thing you can do to reset
your brain and body health. So that's a functional answer in terms of,
you know, what is sleep in terms of its benefits. Sleep as a process
though, is an incredibly complex physiological ballet. And if you were
to recognize or see what happens to your brain and your body at night,
during sleep, you would be blown away. And the paradox is that most of
us, and I would think this too, you know, if I wasn't a sleep
scientist, we go to bed, we lose consciousness for seven to nine
hours, and then we sort of wake up in the morning, and we generally
feel better. And in some ways that denies the physiological and
biological beauty of sleep. So upstairs in your brain, when you're
going through these different stages of sleep, the changes in
brainwave activity are far more dramatic than those that we see when
we're awake. And we can speak about deep sleep and what happens there,
REM sleep is a fascinating time, which is another stage of sleep,
often called dream sleep, which is rapid eye movement sleep, that
stage of sleep some parts of your brain are up to 30%, more active
than when you're awake. So again, it's kind of violating this idea
that our mind is dormant. And our body is just simply quiescent and
resting. So I would happy to just sort of double click on either one
of those, and also what changes in the body as well. But it is an
intense evolutionary adaptive benefit and system. That said, though, I
would almost push back against an evolved system when we think about
the question of sleep and what sleep is. Our assumption has always
been that we evolved to sleep. And I've actually questioned that and I
have no way to get in a time capsule and go back and prove this, but
what if we started off sleeping, and it was from sleep, that
wakefulness emerged? Why do we assume that it's the other way around?
And I think there's probably some really good evidence that sleep may
have been the proto state, that it was the basic fundamental living
state. And when we became awake, as it were, we always had to return
to sleep. You know, in some ways, at that point, sleep was the price
that we paid for wakefulness. And that's another way of describing
what sleep is. But again, I think it sort of denies that the active
state of sleep, it's not a passive state of sleep either. And then
finally, you can say what is sleep across different species? And in us
human beings, and in all mammalian species and avian species as well,
sleep is broadly separated into these two main types. And we've got
non rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand, and then we've got rapid
eye movement sleep on the other. And we can speak about how they
unfold across a night and their architecture because it's not just
intellectually interesting from the perspective of what sleep is, it's
also practically impactful for our daily lives. And I'd love to sort
of go down that route too. But you navigate, you tell me I can. No,
no, let's definitely go down that route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=620"&gt;REM (Rapid Eye Movement) aka 'Paradoxical Sleep'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you mentioned how active the brain is, during certain phases of
sleep. When I was coming up in science, REM sleep, rapid eye movement
sleep was referred to as paradoxical sleep, is that still a good way
to think about it? Paradoxical because the brain is so active, and yet
we are essentially paralyzed, correct? Yeah, it really is a paradox.
And where that came from was simply the brainwave recordings, that if
all I'm measuring about you, is your brainwave activity, it's very
difficult for me sitting outside of the sleep laboratory room to
figure out, are you awake, or are you in REM sleep? Because those two
patterns of brain activity are so close to one another, you can't
discriminate between them. Yet, the paradox is that when you are
awake, I go in there and you're sort of sitting up, you're clearly
conscious and awake. But yet, when you go into REM sleep, you are
completely paralyzed. And that's one of the I think that's part of the
paradox. But the paradox really just comes down to two dramatically
different conscious states. Yet, brain activity is dramatically more
similar than different. And the way I can figure out which of the two
you are in is by measuring two other signals, the activity from your
eyes and the activity from your muscles. So when we're awake, we will
occasionally have these blinks, and we'll have sort of seek heads. But
during REM sleep, you have these really bizarre, horizontal shuttling
eye movements that occur. And that's where the name comes from rapid
eye movements. Are they always horizontal? Mostly, they are
horizontal. - That's interesting. And that's one of the ways that we
can differentiate them from other waking eye movement activity, 'cause
it's not always like it can be sometimes horizontal, but can also have
diagonal and also vertical in that plane. But then the muscle activity
is the real dead giveaway, just before you enter REM sleep, your
brainstem, which is where the dynamics of non REM and REM are
essentially played out and then expressed upstairs in the cortex and
downstairs in the body, when we go into REM sleep, and just a few
seconds before that happens, the brainstem sends a signal all the way
down the spinal cord. And it communicates with what are called the
alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord which control the voluntary
skeletal muscles. And it's a signal of paralysis. And when you go into
dream sleep, you are locked into a physical incarceration of your own
body. - Amazing. You know, why would Mother Nature do such a thing?
And it's in some ways very simple. The brain paralyzes the body so
that the mind can dream safely. Because think about how quickly we
would have all been popped out of the gene pool. You know, if I think
I'm, you know, one of the best skydivers who can just simply fly, and
I've had some times those dreams, too, you know, and I get up on my
apartment window, and I leap out. You're done. - You're done, you
know. So that's one of the sort of that's part of the paradox of REM
sleep, both it's brain activity similarity, despite the behavioral
state being so different and this bizarre lockdown of the sort of
brain of the body itself. Now, of course, the involuntary muscles
thankfully aren't paralyzed. So you keep breathing, your heart keeps
beating. Is this why men have erections during REM sleep, and women
have vaginal lubrication during sleep? That's one of the reasons part
of the other reason though there is because of the autonomic activity.
So there is a nervous, a part of our nervous system called the
autonomic nervous system, and it controls many of the automatic
behaviors. And some of those are aspects of our reproductive
facilities. During REM sleep, what we later discovered is that you go
through these bizarre what we call autonomic storms, which sounds
dramatic, but it actually is when you measure them. That you'll go
through periods where your heart rate, decelerates and drops and your
blood pressure goes down and then utterly randomly, your heart rate
accelerates dramatically, and what we call the fight or flight branch
of the autonomic nervous system or the sympathetic nervous system,
badly named 'cause it's anything but sympathetic, it's very
aggravating, that all of a sudden fires up and then it shuts down
again. And it's not in any regular way. And it's when you get those
autonomic storms, you get very activated from a physiologic
perspective that you can have these erections and you have vaginal
discharge et cetera. But you're totally paralyzed? But you are still
paralyzed. There are only two voluntary muscle groups that are speared
from the paralysis, bizarre. One, your extra ocular muscles, because
if they were paralyzed, you wouldn't be able to have rapid eye
movements. And the other that we later discovered was the inner ear
muscle. And we've got no good understanding as to why those two
muscles groups are speared from the paralysis. It may have something
to do with cranial nerve but I don't think it's that, I think it's
perhaps something more sensory related. Some people have argued that
the reason the eyeballs are speared from the paralysis is because if
your eyeballs are left for long periods of time, inactive, you may get
things such as oxygen sort of issues in the aqueous or vitreous humor.
And so the eyeballs have to keep draining. The drainage systems of the
anterior eye are made to require movement. - Exactly. People with
glaucoma have deficits in drainage through the anterior chamber, but
there I'm speculating. I'm also speculating, when I ask this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=975"&gt;Slow Wave Sleep aka 'Deep Sleep'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would imagine that there are states in waking that also resemble
slow wave sleep, or rather that there are states that slow wave sleep
also resembles waking states. You've beautifully illustrated how REM
sleep can mimic some of the more active brain states that we achieve
in waking. What sort of waking state that I might have experienced or
experience on a daily basis might look similar to slow wave sleep, non
REM sleep, if any? It's a genius way of thinking about it turns the
tables I love it. We almost never see anything like the true ultra
slow waves of deep non REM sleep. So we spoke about these two stages
non REM and REM. Non REM is further subdivided into four separate
stages, stages, one through four, increasing in their depth of sleep.
So stages three and four that's what we typically call deep non REM
sleep. Stages one and two light non REM. So maybe take me through the
arc of a night just so that. So I put my head down, well, for you,
what time do you normally go to sleep? So I'm usually sort of around
about 10:30pm guy. And usually I'll naturally wake up sort of a little
bit before 7:00, sometimes before 6:45 or 7:00, I have an alarm set
for 7:04am. You heard it here, folks Matt Walker does use an alarm
clock. I rarely, rarely I'm usually sort of. He doesn't recommend it,
but he does use it. Yeah, I usually. - You're human after all. Oh, I
am so human. And I've had my sleep issues and I'd love to speak about
that too. But it's only just, you know, in the event that, you know,
'cause I like to keep regularity too. You've got to keep those two
things in balance. And 7:04 just because, you know, why not be
idiosyncratic. I don't know why we always set things on these hot
numbers. So yep so when you. So you go to sleep around 10:30, so using
you as an example, because I imagine a number of people go to sleep at
different times. But 10:30 is about when I go to sleep, 11 is for me.
But so you go to sleep at 10:30, so for that first, let's say three
hours of sleep, what does the architecture of that sleep look like as
compared to the last three hours of your sleep before morning? Yeah,
so I should note that that sort of, you know, 10:30 to 7:00 that's
just based on my chronotype and my preferential it's different for
different people. I'm not suggesting that that's the perfect sweet
spot for humanity's sleep. It's just my natural sweet spot. But I
imagine most people probably go to sleep somewhere between 10pm and
midnight. It's somewhere between 9 and midnight. And most probably
wake up between 5am and 7am or 5:30 and 7:30. Yeah, yeah at least in
if you look at sort of first world nations, that's a typical sleep
profile. So when I first fall asleep, I'll go into the light stages of
non REM sleep stages one and two of non REM. And then I'll start to
descend down into the deeper stages of non REM sleep. So after about
maybe 20 minutes, I'm starting to head down into stage three non REM
and then into stage four non REM sleep. And as I'm starting to fall
asleep, as I've cast off from the usually with me, murky waters of
wakefulness, and I'm in the shallows of sleep stages one and two, my
heart rate starts to drop a little bit. And then my brainwave pattern
activity starts to slow down. Normally when I'm awake, it's going up
and down, maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times a second. As I'm going into
light, non REM sleep, it will slow down to maybe 15, 20 and then
really starts to slow down down to about sort of 10 or eight cycles
per second, eight cycle waves per second. Then as I'm starting to move
into stages three and four, non REM sleep, several remarkable things
happen. All of a sudden, my heart rate really does start to drop. Oh,
and I'll come back to temperature, I'm going to write temperature down
'cause I always forget these things. Now I'm solidly in the foothills
of middle age. So as I'm starting to go into those deeper stages of
non REM sleep, all of a sudden, hundreds of thousands of cells in my
cortex all decide to fire together and then they all go silent
together. And it's this remarkable physiological coordination of the
likes that we just don't see at during any other brain state. That's
really interesting, other than recordings from the brains of animals
and a little bit from humans, I don't think I've ever seen the entire
cortex or even entire regions of cortex light up like that. Yeah, it's
stunning. It's almost like this beautiful sort of mantra chant, or
this sort of, you know, it's a slow inhale and then a meditative
exhale, inhale, exhale. And these waves are just enormous in their
size. And the body is capable of movement at this time, there is no
paralysis. There is no paralysis, but for the most part, muscle tone
has also dropped significantly. Interesting. - At that point. And then
you will, or I will then stay there for about another 20 or 30
minutes. So now I'm maybe 60, or 70 minutes into my first sleep cycle.
And then I'll start to rise back up, back up into stage two non REM
sleep. And then after about 80 or so minutes, I'll pop up, and I'll
have a short REM sleep period, and then back down, I go again, down
into non REM, up into REM. And you do that reliably, repeatedly, and I
will be doing that, and I do do that every 90 minutes. At least that's
the average for most adults, it's different in different species. What
changes to your question is the ratio of non REM to REM within that 90
minute cycle as you move across the night. And what I mean by this is,
in the first half of the night, the majority of those 90 minute cycles
are comprised of a lot of deep non REM sleep, that's when I get my
stage three and four of deep non REM sleep. Once I push through to the
second half of the night, now that seesaw balance changes. And
instead, the majority of those 90 minute cycles are comprised either
of this lighter form of non REM sleep, stage two non REM sleep, and
much more and increasingly more rapid eye movement sleep. And the
implication that I was sort of speaking about pragmatically is, let's
say that I have to, and I usually never do early morning flights or
red eyes, just because I'm a mess if that happens, I'm not suggesting
other people shouldn't. I'm suggesting people not not do that. Every
time I've taken a red eye or I've done that two or three days later, I
get some sort of general feeling of malaise, my brain doesn't work as
well, I think red eyes should be abolished. For the pilots too I mean,
and for the. And we can speak about those, there's data. And for the
emergency room, I mean, long shifts have been shown to lead to, you
know, physician induced errors that lead to a lot of fatalities. I
mean, there are a lot of reasons why staying up too long, or being up
at the wrong times, if you're not adapted to it is just terrible. You
have the data and all of those cases, you know, particularly
physicians too there was some recent data looking at suicidality. And
the rates of suicide in training physicians are, you know, far, far
above the norm. And I don't suspect that, you know, the schedules are
helping them I suspect that sleep is a missing part of that
explanatory equation, but. I teach medical students and they they're
phenomenal, but yeah, they're under extremely challenged conditions.
We shouldn't put them under those conditions. [Andrew] No, it's not
optimizing performance, I have one. But sorry, I was sorry. No, no,
this is important. These it's an important digression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=1440"&gt;Compensating For Lost Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one question, which is you're saying that as across the night,
a greater percentage of these 90 minute cycles are going to be
occupied by REM sleep as you progress through the night. I'm aware
that, based on work that you've done and from your public education
efforts and others that we have so called circadian forces, and we
have other forces that are driving when we sleep and when we want to
sleep, etcetera. Without going into the details of those, I've a
simple question, the experiment is the following. Let's say, God
forbid, you are prevented from going to sleep at your normal time and
you stay up for the four hours or five hours that normally you would
be in predominantly slow wave sleep. If let's say you finally get to
lie down at 3am a time when normally your sleep would be occupied
mostly by rapid eye movement sleep, will you experience a greater
percentage of rapid eye movement sleep because of these so called
circadian forces, meaning that's what's appropriate for that time? Or
will your system need to start at the beginning of the race that were,
as I'm referring to it, that we're calling sleep? And for if that's
not clear to anybody, basically, what I'm asking is, if you are forced
to skip the slow wave sleep part of the night, will your system leap
into rapid eye movement sleep? Or does it have to start at the
beginning and get slow wave sleep first? In other words, does one
sleep state drive the entry to the next sleep state? Great question,
so there is some degree of reciprocity between the sleep states I
should note that when we drive one of those up, we often but not
always see a change in the other. There are some pharmacologies that
have shown an independence to that. And we've also played around with
things like temperature, and sometimes you can, you know, nudge one
and not seem to upset or perturb the other. But to your, I think,
lovely point, the answer is, it's a mix, but it's mostly the latter.
Meaning you will mostly go into your REM sleep phases, and be
significantly deficient in your deep sleep. So just because I start my
sleep cycle at 3am, rather than at 10:30pm, it doesn't mean that my
brain just says, well, I've got a program, and I'm just going to run
the program, and the way the program runs is that we always start with
a first couple of hours of deep sleep. So we're just going to begin
act number one, scene one, it doesn't do that. Now, I will get some
deep sleep to begin with and part of that is just because of how sleep
works. Based on how long I've been awake, longer I'm awake, there is a
significantly greater pressure for deep sleep. But we actually use
exactly what you just described as an experimental technique to
selectively deprive people of one of those stages of sleep or the
other. So we will do first half of the night deprivation, and then let
you sleep the second half. So that means that you will be mostly deep
sleep deprived, and you will still get mostly all of your REM sleep.
And then we switch it, so you only get your first four hours, which
means you will mostly get deep non REM sleep, but you will get almost
no REM sleep. So in both of those groups, they've both had four hours
of sleep. So the difference between them in terms of an experimental
outcome is not the sleep time because they both slept for the same
amount. It's the contribution of those different stages. Now, we
actually have more elegant methods for sort of selectively going in
there and scooping out different stages of sleep. But that's the way
we used to do it old school was just using this timing difference. And
who suffers more? Those that lack the early phase, and were those that
lack the later phase of the night sleep? In other words, if I have to
sleep only four hours for whatever reason, am I better off getting the
early part of the night's sleep or the second half of the night sleep?
Depends on what the outcome measure is. So that gets right to the
differences between slow wave sleep and REM. Right. - I was probably
misinformed. But my understanding a very crude understanding I should
say before. I very much doubt I'll contrary with someone like you.
Which is that's very nice of you. The first part of the night the slow
wave sleep is restorative to the musculature to motor learning, and
that the dream content tends to be less emotional. The second half of
the night, being more emotional dreams and sort of the unpairing of
the emotional load of our previous day and other experiences. So in
other words, if I were to deprive myself, excuse me of REM, I would be
hyper emotional, not maybe not as settled with the kind of experiences
of my life. Whereas if I deprive myself of slow wave sleep, I would
feel a more physical malaise. Is that correct? Or is that far too
simple? And if it is too simple, please tell me where I'm wrong? No, I
think much of that is correct. And it's sort of that plus. So for
example, during deep non REM sleep, that's where we get this. It's
almost a form of natural blood pressure medication. And so when I take
that away from you, the next day, we're usually going to see autonomic
dysfunction, we're usually going to see abnormalities in heart rate
blood pressure. We also know that during deep non REM sleep, that
there is a certain control of specific hormones. For example, we know
that the insulin regulation of sort of metabolism, meaning how will
you look from a regulated blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated,
pre diabetic look of profile. That's where deep sleep seems to matter
if we selectively deprive you of that we can see. Growth hormone. -
Growth hormone is different actually. So that's a beautiful
demonstration where growth hormone seems to be more REM sleep
dependent. And that's why we can come on to the effects of alcohol and
there's some really impressive frightening data on alcohol and it's
disruption of sleep. But then we also know testosterone, peak levels
of testosterone happen during REM sleep. So the second half of the
night, essentially. Which is the second half of the night. So it
really just means that the, your profile of mental and physical
dysfunction will be different under both of those conditions. Which
one would you prefer? I would prefer neither of them. And it really
depends on what you're trying to optimize for. So it's just so
complicated, sleep is just so pluripotent, you know, it's so
physiologically systemic, that it's almost impossible not to undergo
one of those two things, just deep sleep deprivation, or just REM
sleep deprivation, and not show a profile that you would really prefer
to avoid. And that's the reason from an evolutionary standpoint, that
we've preserved those stages of sleep. I mean, sleep is just so
idiotic, you know, from an evolutionary perspective. Or maybe waking
is idiotic. Or waking is, you know, well, yeah. Based on your previous
idea. Who've you been talking to? I think that comment is very
specific to me. Yeah, I am normally always an idiot when working. But
I think this idea that sleep, you know, is so profoundly detrimental
to us, if you were to take it at face value, you know, you're not
finding a mate, you're not reproducing, you're not foraging for food,
you're not caring for you're young and worst of all, you're vulnerable
to predation, on any one of those grounds sleep probably should have
been selected against. But it wasn't sleep has fought its way through
heroically every step along the evolutionary path. And therefore,
every sleep stage has also survived as best we can tell. What that
means is that those are non negotiable. If mother nature had found a
way to even just sort of, you know, thin slice some of that sleep from
us, there would have been vast, I'm sure evolutionary benefits, but
looks as though she hasn't. And I'm usually in favor of her wisdom
after 3.6 million years, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=1940"&gt;Waking in the Middle Of The Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it's incredible. I want to introduce a another
Gedankenexperiment, other thought experiment. So in this arc of the
night, slow wave sleep predominates early in the night, and then REM
sleep. There's a scenario that many people including myself experience
on a regular basis. Which is they go to sleep, sleeping just fine,
three, four hours into it, they wake up. They wake up, for whatever
reason, maybe there was a noise, maybe the temperature isn't right, we
will certainly talk about sleep hygiene, etcetera. They get up, they
go to the restroom, they might flip on the lights, they might not,
they'll get back in bed hopefully they're not picking up their phone
and starting to browse and wake up the brain through various
mechanisms light and cognitive stimulation, etcetera. They go back to
sleep, let's say after about 10, 15 minutes, they're able to fall back
asleep. And then they sleep till their more typical wake time. How
detrimental is that wake up episode or event in terms of longevity,
learning, et cetera? I would love to sleep the entire night through
every night, but most nights I don't. And yet, I feel pretty good
throughout the day, some days better than others. So if you were to
kind of evaluate that waking episode, and compare it to sleeping the
whole night through, what are your your thoughts on that? So I think
if you're waking up sort of frequently, as you're describing, I would
probably get your estate in order because my guess is within the next
year, you're going to be you're going to be done for, no I'm kidding
you. Absolutely kidding you. It is perfectly natural and normal,
particularly as we progress with age, you know, children tend to have
typically more continuous sleep. Now it's not that they aren't waking
up for brief periods of time they are and in fact, we all do. When we
come out the other end of our sleep cycle at the end of our REM sleep
period of the 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes up and we make a
postural movement, we turn over because we've been paralyzed for so
long and the body will also like to shift it's weight or position. Do
we ever look around? Ever open our eyes and look around? You,
sometimes people will open their eyes, but usually it's only for a
brief period of time and they usually never commit those awakenings to
memory. Your situation and it's my situation as well, I usually now at
this stage of life, I don't sleep through the night. I'll usually have
a bathroom break and then I'll come back. That's perfectly normal. We
tend to forget that in sleep science, we think of sleep efficiency so
of the total amount of time that you're in bed, how much of that
percent time is spent asleep? And we usually look to numbers that are
above 85%, or more as a healthy sleep efficiency. So if you're to
think about me going to bed and I spend, you know, let's say, eight
and a quarter, eight and a half hours of time in bed, with a normal,
healthy sleep efficiency, I still may be only sleeping a total of
seven and a half hours, or seven and three quarter hours. Meaning that
I'm going to be awake in total, not in one long about, but I'm going
to be awake for upwards of 30 minutes, net some time. Sometimes that
can be after a 10 minute, you know, dalliance after having gone to the
bathroom, and I'm just gradually drifting back off again. Other times,
it will just be for a couple of minutes. And most of those you don't
commit. So I think we need to stop, we don't need to get too worried
about, you know, periods of time awake, just because we're not
sleeping throughout the night. I would love to do that, too. And I
remember when that used to happen, and it still happens occasionally.
Every once in a while, it feels great when it does happen. And it's a
lovely thing. It's a surprise right? Like oh my goodness I slept
through the whole night. It is now a surprise, yeah it is a surprise.
But for the most part, I think we can be more relaxed about that where
we have to be a bit more attentive, though, is if you're spending long
periods of time, not being able to get back to sleep. And usually we
define that by saying, if it's been 20, 25 minutes, normally, that's
the time when we would really say okay, let's explore this, what's
going on? Let's see what's happening. The other thing is if it's
happening very frequently, so even if you're, you know, not awake for
25 minutes stretches, but you're finding yourself waking up and being
consciously aware that you've woken up for maybe six, seven or eight
times throughout the night and your sleep is very what we call
fragmented the great science of sleep in the past five or 10 years has
been yes, quantity is important, but quality is just as important. And
you can't have one without the other in terms of a good beneficial
next day outcome. You can't just get four hours of sleep, but
brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpaired. Nor can you get eight
hours of sleep, but have very poor quality of sleep and be unimpaired
the next day. So that's why I just sort of want to asterisk, this idea
of let's not get too worried about waking up and having some time
awake, that's perfectly normal and natural. But if it's happening very
frequently throughout the night, or those periods of time, or long
stretches of time, upwards of 25 minutes, then let's look into it.
Well, I can assure you just helped a lot of people feel better about
this waking up episode that I and many other people experience. I hope
so 'cause I think it's really important that we, you know, I think
I've been desperately guilty of perhaps, you know, early on being too
puritanical about, you know, sleep and I've retrospected, and I've
tried to explore why this was the case, you know, it was almost sleep
or else, dot, dot, dot. And at the time when I was starting to write
the book, which was back in 2016, you know, sleep was still a
neglected stepsister in the health conversation of today. And I could
see all of the, That has certainly changed. And it's changing, you
know, and not because it's my efforts, but because of all of my
colleagues. I would say, well, it's great that you give attribution to
the other people involved. And of course, it's a big field. But I
think you've done a great service by cueing people to the importance
of this state, not just for avoiding troublesome outcomes, but also
for optimizing their waking state. It's really, you know, I view sleep
as this period that feels good, but we're not aware of how it feels
when we're in it necessarily. It has tremendous benefits when you're
doing it well, so to speak, and it has tremendous deficits when we're
not. And I think it was an important thing for you to do to cue people
to this issue. And I would say mission accomplished, that people are
aware of the need for sleep. I think that knowing that waking up in
the middle of the night is normal, provided it's not too frequent is
great and will also help people who may have been overly concerned
about that. I do want to use this as an opportunity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=2388"&gt;Uberman (Not Huberman!) Sleep Schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to raise something about the so called Uberman schedule not to be
confused with the Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one has confused
those yet. Some years ago, there was a discussion about the so called
Uberman schedule, meaning the Superman schedule. So that's Huberman
without an H, which I have nothing to do with. If you read your
Nietzsche this will have a subtext. But regardless, the Uberman
schedule, as I understand is one in which the person elects to sleep
in 90 minute, bouts spread throughout the day and night, in an attempt
to get more productivity and or reduce their overall sleep need. There
was a paper published recently that explored whether or not this is
good or bad for us. Maybe you just give us the take home message on
that. Yes, so these Uberman like schedules and there's lots of
different forms of that, they tried to essentially pie chart the 24
hour period, into short bouts of sleep with some shorter or no, well,
slightly longer periods of wakefulness, then short bouts of sleep then
wakefulness. You know, you're, I sort of made it, I think a quip, it's
almost like you're sleeping like a baby, you know, 'cause that's the
way that babies will sleep. In 90 minute naps. That they will have,
you know, these brief naps, then they're awake, then they're asleep
then they're awake. And to the chagrin of parents across the night,
it's basically the same, they're awake, they're asleep, they're awake,
they're asleep. And that's more the schedule that these types of
protocols have suggested. And there was a really great comprehensive
review that found not only that they weren't necessarily helpful, but
they were actually really quite detrimental. And on almost every
performance metric, whether it be task performance, whether it be
physiological outcome measures, whether it even be the quality of the
sleep that they were having, when they were trying to get it, all of
those were in a downward direction. And it's not surprising if you
look at your the way that your physiology is programmed, if you look
at the way your circadian rhythm is programmed, none of that screams
to us that we should be sleeping in that way. Well, I'm chuckling
because we always hear sleep like a baby. This is how babies sleep.
And I would say don't sleep like a baby, sleep like an adult be an
adult, get your solid eight hours. It's Billy Crystal's line, he was,
you know, a long standing suffering insomniac, he says I sleep like a
baby, I'm awake every 20 minutes. You know, and I think this is
another one of those demonstrations that when you fight biology, you
normally lose. And the way you know you've lost is disease, sickness
and impairment. And I think if you sleep, in accordance with the
natural biological edict that we've all been given, life tends to be
both have a higher quality and a longer duration. Yeah, I agree. Along
those lines, as a vision scientists,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=2568"&gt;Viewing Morning SUNLight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been very excited by the work on these non image forming cells in
the eye, the so called melanopsin cells that inform the brain about
circadian time of day. And I'm a big proponent of people getting some
sunlight, ideally sunlight, but other forms of bright light in their
eyes early in the day and when they want to be awake. Essentially,
during the phase of their 24 hour circadian cycle when temperature is
rising, and then starting to get less light in their eyes as our
temperature is going down in terms of later in the day and in the
evening. Are there any adjustments to that general theme that you'd
like to add? Or is in any way? No, I think that's exactly what we
recommend right now. Which is try to get at least 30 to 40 minutes of
exposure to some kind of natural daylight. Now, there may be parts of
the world where, you know, it's. You're from your from a rather cloudy
part of the world. I am from Liverpool, England, and the Northwest of
England is not known for its beach resorts and fine weather. I
remember I sort of, I went back home for a trip when I'd first been
out in California, and I thought, why is the sky so low? Just you
know, constantly we joke that in the UK, we usually have nine months
of bad weather and then three months of Winter. And then that's your
entire year in terms of climate. But to come to your point, you're
exactly right, try to get that daylight. Now it can be you know,
working next to a window and you're getting that natural sunlight. But
that natural sunlight is even on a cloudy day in England is usually
far more potent than anything that you'll get from indoor lighting,
despite you thinking sort of from a perception wise, maybe the much
closer than I would think. Yeah, I've been I'm sorry to interrupt.
I've been a big proponent of there's a an app called Light Meter,
which will it's a free app, I have nothing to do with it that will
allow you to get a pretty decent measurement of the amount of light
energy coming toward you. And if you hold it up to a cloudy morning,
where you don't think it's very bright out kind of a dismal day,
you'll notice that there'll be 1,000, 2,000, even you know, 5,000 Lux,
Lux just being a measure of brightness, of course. And then you can
point the same light meter toward an indoor light that seems very
bright and very intense and it'll say 500 Lux and you realize that the
intensity as we gauge it, perceptually is not really what the system
is receiving. So outdoor light is key. How do you get this natural
stimulation? Or I should just say light stimulation early in the day,
what is your typical, what does Matt Walker do to get this light
stimulation? I am no poster child, but usually I will, if I'm working
out I usually work out most days. And I shopped around and I found a
gym that has huge amounts of window exposure facing to the East. This
is going to sound so ridiculous you know, Matt Walker chooses a gym on
the basis. I love it - Of the solar impact so he cannot you know
correct his circadian. There are a lot of criteria for selecting gyms,
this one is actually grounded in physiology, and biology and so. And
selfishness about my own sleep. No it's great. So you get the your
exercise and your light stimulation simultaneously? That's right, yep,
yeah. And so you're stacking cues for wakefulness early in the day.
Exactly, so both exercise and daylight are wonderful cues for
circadian rhythm alignment, and also circadian rhythm reset each day.
And so I will use both exercise, I mean, I'm neither a strong morning
type or a strong evening type. And my preference to exercise is
probably sometime in the middle of the day, probably somewhere around
1pm sorry, not 1am. But I'm usually working out probably around the
sort of seven, sort of 45 8am time, that's usually when I'll start my
workout. And there I will start with cardio spin bike facing a window.
And luckily, for the most part here in California, there's usually
sunlight coming through. But it doesn't matter to me because just as
you said, even when it's a cloudy day that Lux coming through of
light, the intensity is splendid. So I would prefer to favor my
exercise just because for efficiency too, I want to get also working
on the day, I'll try to match my exercise more with my circadian light
exposure than I would probably if I'm going to do I really want to
crush a workout, or do I want to just, you know, make sure it's a good
workout? I would prefer to work out, you know, at a different time.
But I like that because of the daylight. And we can speak about
exercise timing at some point, because there's a lot of discussion
around that, when is the right time to exercise during sleep. And we
can sort of bust some myths there too. So I think you're spot on with
the suggestion, get some morning daylight, try to get that exposure,
usually at least 30 to 40 minutes, there was some great work recently
coming out in the occupational health domain, where they moved workers
from offices that were just facing walls and you know, didn't have any
exposure to natural daylight. And then they did a time period during
that study where they actually were in front of a window and working.
And they measured their sleep and their sleep time and their sleep
efficiency increased quite dramatically. I'm forgetting the numbers
now but I think the increase in total sleep time is well over 30
minutes. And the improvement in sleep efficiency was five to 10%. You
know, and if you're batting an 80%, you know, sleep efficiency
average, we're a bit concerned about that. But add 10% to that and now
you're in you know, a great echelon of healthy sleepers. And all you
did was just spend some time working in front of windows. That's great
and probably folks might want to consider spending a little less time
with sunglasses provided they can do that safely, you know, driving,
etcetera. You're not alone with your exercise behavior and facing
East. So the one and only Tim Ferriss told me recently that his
morning routine nowadays consists of jumping rope while facing East to
get the sunlight stimulation of the eyes. And as Matt and I both know,
it has to be of the eyes, right? These portals are the only way to
convey to the rest of the brain and body about the time of day and
wakefulness. Along the lines of wakefulness,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=2960"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of questions about caffeine. The dreaded and beloved
caffeine, I love caffeine, but I like it in relatively restricted
periods of time. So I'm a big fan of waking up and even though I wake
up very groggy, allowing my natural wakefulness signals to take hold,
meaning I wake up very slowly, but I don't drink caffeine right away.
I sort of delay caffeine by a little while, usually 90 minutes to two
hours. And that idea came to me on the basis of my understanding of
how caffeine and the adenosine receptor interact. I have a feeling
you're going to pronounce adenosine differently than I do. No, no, I
will with that, I will go with adenosine. I've tried to go with your
skeletal instead skeletal and synapse and synapse. Schedule and
schedule. - There we go. But to make it really simple for folks, how
does caffeine work to make us feel more alert? And does the timing in
which we ingest caffeine play an important role in whether or not it
works for us or against us? So maybe we just start with how does
caffeine work? Why is it that when I drink mate or coffee, which are
my preferred sources of caffeine, do I feel a mental and physical
lift? Yeah so I'm going to suggest counter to what most people would
think, drink coffee. Or mate, is mate okay also? [Matthew] Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Whatever form you enjoy. We'll come on to sort of why I suggest
that but when it comes to coffee, I would say the dose and the timing
makes the poison. So let's start with how caffeine works. Caffeine is
in a class of drugs that we call the psychoactive stimulants. So it
works through a variety of mechanisms, one is a dopamine mechanism
dopamine we often think of as a reward chemical or, but dopamine is
also very much an alerting neurochemical, as well. And caffeine has
some role it seems to play in increasing dopamine. But its principal
mode of action, we believe in terms of making me more alert and
keeping me awake throughout the day is on the effects of adenosine.
And to explain what adenosine is from the moment that you and I woke
up this morning, this chemical adenosine has been building up in our
brain. And the longer that we're awake, the more of that adenosine
accumulates, Is it mask, may I ask, is it accumulating in neurons in
glia, or in the blood vessels? Where and is it also accumulating in my
body? Where is this adenosine coming from? And where is it
accumulating? Yeah, so the adenosine here that we're talking about
that is creating the sleep pressure is a central brain phenomenon. And
it comes from the neurons themselves combusting energy. And as they're
combusting energy, one of the offshoots of that is this chemical
adenosine. And so as we're awake throughout the day, and our brain is
metabolically very active, it's accumulating and building up this
adenosine. Now, the more adenosine that we have, the sleepier that we
will feel. So it really is like a sleep pressure is what we call it.
Now, it's not a mechanical pressure, don't worry, your head's not
going to explode, it's a chemical pressure. And it's this weight of
sleepiness that we feel gradually growing as we get into the evening.
May I just interrupt you again to just ask do we know what the circuit
mechanism is for that? I mean, not to go too far down the rabbit hole,
but for the aficionados and for myself, we have brain mechanisms like
locus coeruleus that are release things that our brain areas locus
coeruleus is just being a brain area, of course that release things
that proactively create wakefulness. So are those neurons shutting
down as a consequence of having too much adenosine? Or are there areas
of the brain that promote sleepiness that are getting activated?
Because these, you can imagine both things working in parallel, one or
the other would accomplish the same endpoint? Yeah and it's both. And
so there are two main receptors for adenosine the A1 receptor and the
A2 receptor. And they have different modes of activating brain cells
or inactivating or decreasing the likelihood of firing. And adenosine
works in this beautiful, elegant way, where it will inhibit and shut
down the wake promoting areas of the brain whilst also increasing and
dialing up the volume on sleep activating, sleep promoting range.
Biology is so beautiful. [Matthew] Oh it's fantastic. There's a push
pull, I mean, and we could have a larger discussion at some point
about that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. Our
ability to smell or to sense pressure on this, everything's a push
pull in Biology. Oh it's great, yeah, yep. So this is another example
where as I am awake longer, adenosine is released in the brain. And my
wakefulness areas are being actively shut down by that adenosine and
my sleepiness brain areas, so to speak, are being promoted to be more
active, is that correct? That's right and it's a very progressive
process. It's not like a step function, where and sometimes that
happens occasionally, but it's usually because you've been sort of
driving through and as we'll come on to have caffeine in the system,
and then all of a sudden you just hit a wall and it just, you know
engulfs you and you go from zero to the one of sleepiness within a
short period of time. What explains the fatigue after a hard
conversation? The desire to go to sleep or desire to go to sleep
during a hard conversation? That's an interesting one. I think it's
usually just based on personality type interactions. And for the most
part. Not that I've ever experienced that before. No people with you
don't, but with me, they. Oh no, no, I've experienced the desired to
some conversations, I'm halfway through them and I feel like I want to
take a nap. Yeah. - Right. And I would love to look at you know,
people's sleep history. We've sort of seen that time and time again,
but and then it could be, you know, with folks like me, people just
lose the will to live within about five minutes of speaking with me,
so. Not true, they hear that sleep is important. [cross talking]
Unrelated. - [Andrew] That's awesome. And that's flattery, that's
great. But so the way that then caffeine comes into this equation, as
they're saying, it's usually a kind of a linear process. Or maybe it's
probably closer to an exponential in terms of your subjective feeling
of sleepiness. And we haven't really been able to measure that in
humans, because normally, we it's hard to actually, you know, stick
something into the brain and be, you know, sucking, siphoning off
stuff every couple of minutes, as you could do in animal studies. And
keep asking people every couple of minutes, how sleepy do you feel,
how sleepy? And track to see if there's a linear rise in, you know,
adenosine, which then creates an exponential rise in subjective
sleepiness or what the dynamics are, but I'm kind of nerding out.
Caffeine comes into play here, because caffeine comes into your system
and it latches on to those welcome sights of adenosine the adenosine
receptors. But what it doesn't do is latch on to them and activate
them. Because if it was doing that, then it would, you know, in lots
of ways it would dial up more sort of sleepiness. It does the
opposite. The way that caffeine works is that it comes in, competes
with quite sharp elbows with adenosine competitively forces them out
of the way, hijacks that receptor by latching onto it, but then just
essentially blocks it. It doesn't inactivate the receptor, it doesn't
activate the receptor, it functionally inactivates it in the sense
that it takes it out of the game for adenosine. So it's like someone
you know, coming into a room, and you're just about to sit down on the
chair, and caffeine comes in and just pulls out the chair. And you're
like, well, now I've got nowhere to sit. And caffeine just keeps
pulling out the chairs from adenosine and adenosine even though it's
at the same concentration in your brain, your brain doesn't know that
you've been awake for, you know, 10 hours, 16 hours at that point when
you've downed a cup of coffee. Because all of that adenosine that's
still there can't communicate to the brain that you've been awake for
16 hours because. But the adenosine is still in brain circulation.
Correct. - So the real question is what happens when caffeine is
dislodged from the adenosine receptor? Unfortunate things happen. And
that's what we call the caffeine crash. Which is caffeine has a half
life and it's metabolized and. Do you recall what the half life is?
Yeah, the half life is somewhere between five to six hours. And the
quarter life therefore is somewhere between 10 to 12 hours. It's
variable, different people have different durations of its action, but
for the average adult five to six hours. That variation, we understand
it's down to a liver enzyme or a set of liver enzymes of the class
that we call the cytochrome P450 enzymes. And there are I think last I
delved into the data, which is pretty recently, there are two gene
variants that will dictate the enzymatic speed with which the liver
breaks down caffeine. And that's why you can have some people who are
very sensitive to caffeine and other people who say, you know, it just
doesn't affect me really that much at all. These are the people that
have a double espresso after a 9pm dinner and can sleep just fine.
Well, and we'll come onto. Well at least subjectively they think they
are sleeping. Subjectively, yeah, and we should speak about that
assumptive danger too. So then the caffeine is in the system and after
some time period, it will be inactive in the system. So let's say
that, you know, I've been awake for 12 hours now. And it's you know,
8pm and I'm feeling a bit tired, but I want to push through and I want
to keep working for another couple of hours, so I have a cup of
coffee. All of a sudden I was feeling tired, but I don't feel like
I've been awake for 12 hours anymore. Because with the caffeine in the
system, maybe only half of that adenosine is being communicated
through the receptor to my brain. 100% of the adenosine is still
there, only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain. So now I
think oh I haven't been awake for 12 hours, I've just been awake for
six hours, I feel great. Then after a few hours, and the caffeine is
starting to come out of my system, not only am I hit with the same
levels of adenosine that I had before I'd had the cup of coffee
several hours ago, it's that plus, all of the adenosine that's been
building up during the time that the caffeine has been in my system.
So sort of an avalanche of adenosine. It is a tsunami wave, yeah and
that's the caffeine crash. And it's interesting because the caffeine
crash at two o'clock in the afternoon when you have work to do is a
terrible thing. But what about the person, maybe this person is me in
my 20s, who says, I'm going to drink caffeine all day long. And then I
want the crash. Because at nine or 10pm, if I stop drinking caffeine
at say, 6pm, and I crash, then I crash into a slumber, a deep night of
sleep. Is that sleep really as deep as I think it is? Because given
the half life of caffeine that you mentioned a few moments ago, I have
to imagine that having some of that caffeine circulating in my system
might disrupt the depth of sleep, or somehow the architecture of sleep
in a way that even if I get eight, or who knows even 10 hours of
sleep, it might not be as restorative as I would like it to be. Yeah,
and that is the danger, just sort of that, you know, those people that
you described who say, and I, a lot of them will speak with me too
say, look, I can have two espressos with dinner and I fall asleep fine
and I stay asleep. Because usually those are the two phenotypes that
we typically see with too much caffeine. I just can't fall asleep as
easily as I want to, or I fall asleep, but I just can't stay asleep.
And caffeine can do both of those things quite potently. How late in
the day do you think is assuming somebody, translate this folks, if
you go to bed earlier or later, you have to shift the hours
accordingly. But given somebody who typically gets into bed around
10:00, 10:30, and falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30. When would you
recommend they halt caffeine intake? And these are not strict
prescriptives, but I think people do benefit from having some fairly
clear guidelines of what might work for them. Would you say cut off
caffeine, by what time of the day? I would usually say take your
typical bedtime and count back sort of somewhere between 10 to eight
hours is probably getting a little bit close. But take back sort of 10
hours or eight hours of time, that's the time when you should really
stop, you know, using caffeine is the suggestion. And the reason is
because for those people who even just keep drinking up until you
know, into the evening, you're right, that they can fall asleep fine,
maybe they stay asleep, but the depth of their deep sleep is not as
deep anymore. And so there are two consequences. The first is that for
me, and it can be up to by 30%, and for me to drop your deep sleep by
30%, I'd have to age you by between 10 to 12 years, or you can just do
it every night to yourself with a couple of espressos. The second is
that you then wake up the next morning, and you think, well, I didn't
have problems falling asleep and I didn't have problems staying
asleep, but I don't feel particularly restored by my sleep. So now I'm
reaching for three or four cups of coffee the next morning, rather
than just two or three cups of coffee. And so goes this dependency
cycle, that you then need your uppers to wake you up in the morning,
And then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening to bring
them down because they're overly caffeinated and alcohol, and we can
speak about that, too, also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep
as well. So you're right that it's not just the quantity of your
sleep, or even difficulties falling or staying asleep, it can also be
deep sleep. But here again, I think, you know, I don't want to be
frightening people. And I mentioned this before, I think one of the
real problems that I or mistakes that I made, because I didn't you
know, I'd never had much public exposure before the book. And I was so
saddened by you know, the disease and the suffering that I was seeing
as a consequence of a lack of sleep in our society. And the fact that
it wasn't really being discussed very much. I sort of came out, you
know, a little bit headstrong, more than a little bit headstrong. And
I think I was, you know, perhaps too much gas pedal and too little,
you know, break as it were. And I don't think that's the right way to
approach a health message within the public sphere. And I've become
much softer in how I think about these things. I have ideas about what
the ideal world looks like for sleep. But I also realize that none of
us live in this thing called the ideal world. We certainly don't. So,
you know, I want to be really mindful of that, and I think I've done a
really bad job of being sort of too forthright, particularly for
people who struggle with sleep, you know, early on, when I would offer
these sort of messages about sleep. I want to be, you know, I want to
be theoretical when it comes to the science, I want to be faithful to
the science. But I also don't want to go out and scare the living
daylights out of people, particularly people who are struggling with
their sleep, 'cause it's probably only going to make matters worse. So
I've been beautifully schooled by learning how to be a slightly better
public communicator. I'm nowhere near of the standing that you are,
you are very elegant and it's very intuitive to you. I'm still with
training wheels, but I'm getting a little bit better. But I just want
to say that when I'm speaking about caffeine, 'cause it sounds as
though I'm very sort of overt about it. But I will come back to why I
say drink coffee. But I just want to make that point. Yeah, well, I
appreciate you making that point. And I'm sure our listeners will too.
I still will stand behind my statement, which is that what you've done
for the notion that sleep is vital for all aspects of health and for
performance, mental and physical and wakefulness, the message and the
packaging it was contained in and is has been clearly clearly net
positive people needed to be cued to this. Thank you. - The I'll sleep
when I'm dead mentality is one that I had, it's one that other people
have. People in a huge number of vital communities, not just your
students, but also people that this the messaging that you provided
and continue to provide has positively impacted the first responder
community, the medical community, there're still steps that need to be
taken the military community, and of course, the civilian community.
And so I think these adjustments about yeah, caffeine is okay, just
restricted to the early part of the day, if you can, most days, I
mean, I think the law of averages. It's like the light viewing
behavior I think it is critical to view sunlight or natural, some
other form of bright light early in the day but if you miss a day,
it's not that your whole system is going to dissolve into a puddle of
tears. That'll happen on the second or the third day, no I'm kidding,
you've got a couple of days. Biology works in averages except with
respect to accident or injury. A car accident is a car accident,
right? You don't get to have three of those before the brain damage
occurs if the accident's severe enough. But with sleep behavior, these
homeostatic type behaviors, or with food, one chocolate sundae, is it
going to kill you know? No. Every night? Yeah. It's going to make you
demented and kill you early. We know this. And so I think the middle
ground is often a hard place to achieve. So I think you've done a
phenomenal job. But I appreciate you raising these points. And I think
it's clear that we all need to that we all can and should do certain
things better, including being gentle with ourselves from time to time
when we deviate from these ideal circumstances. Along these lines, I
do want to talk about alcohol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=4074"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because I think caffeine and alcohol represent the the kind of two
opposite ends of the spectrum. Clearly there are other stimulants.
There your Adderalls and your high energy drinks that people use. But
alcohol and caffeine are the most commonly consumed stimulants and
sedatives, depressants as they're sometimes called. So what happens
when somebody has a glass? We always hear a glass or two of wine in
the evening or a cocktail after dinner or before dinner, how does that
impact their sleep? And then we'll be sure to circle back in terms of
what is reasonable ranges of behavior when it comes to avoiding
alcohol or if it's age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? Yeah,
so alcohol, if we're thinking about classes of drugs, they're in a
class of drugs that we call the sedatives. And I think one of the
first problems that people often mistake, alcohol is often used as a
sleep aid for people who are struggling with sleep when things like
over the counter remedies, etcetera, or herbal remedies have just not
worked out for them. And alcohol, unfortunately, is anything but a
sleep aid. The first reason that most people use it is to try and help
them fall asleep. So and this process of this event that we call
falling asleep, I have to imagine is a process. It is a process. -
Like everything in biology, and that that process involves in some
way, as we talked about push pull before turning off thinking,
planning, et cetera, and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism.
I have to imagine that these two things are knobs turning in opposite
directions that gives us this outcome we call falling asleep. Alcohol,
it seems is helpful for some people to turn off their thoughts or
their planning. Is that right? Yes, it is. And so I think, you know,
if we look at the pattern of brain activity, if I were to place you
inside an MRI scanner, where we're looking at the activity of your
brain and watch you drifting off, some parts of your brain will become
less active. Other parts will become more active. And this is the push
pull model. It's inhibition excitation. But alcohol is quite different
in that regard. Alcohol is because it's a sedative, what it's really
doing is trying to essentially knock out your cortex. It's sedating
your cortex, and sedation is not sleep. But when we have a couple of
drinks in the evening, when we have a couple of nightcaps, we mistake
sedation for sleep saying, well, I always when I have a couple of
whiskies or a couple of cocktails, it always helps me fall asleep
faster. In truth, what's happening is that you're losing consciousness
quicker, but you're not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep
any quicker. So that's one of the first sort of things just to keep in
mind. The second thing with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep.
And we spoke about the quality of your sleep being just as important
as the quantity. And alcohol through a variety of mechanisms, some of
which are activation of that autonomic nervous system, that fight or
flight branch of the nervous system. Alcohol will actually have you
waking up many more times throughout the night. So your sleep is far
less continuous. Now, some of those awakenings will be of conscious
recollection the next day, you'll just remember waking up, many of
them won't be. And so but yet, your sleep will be littered with these
sort of punctured awakenings throughout the night. And again, when you
wake up the next morning, you don't feel restored by your sleep, you
know, fragmented sleep or non continuous sleep in this alcohol induced
way, is usually not good quality sleep, but you feel great on the next
day. The third part of alcohol in terms of an equation is that it's
quite potent at blocking your REM sleep, your rapid eye movement
sleep. And REM sleep is critical for a variety of cognitive functions.
Some aspects of learning and memory it seems to be critical for
aspects of emotional and mental health. You've described it before as
a sort of self generated therapy that occurs while we sleep. Yeah,
it's overnight therapy, you know, it's emotional first aid. Certainly
people that don't get enough sleep are very easy to derail
emotionally. Not that one would want to do that to people, but we all
sort of fall apart emotionally. I always think of it as almost like
our skin sensitivity can be heightened. Yes, absolutely. - When we are
sleep deprived. Our emotional sensitivity is such that when we're
sleep deprived, such that it takes a much finer grain of sandpaper to
create that kind of friction, things bother us. [Matthew] Threshold to
trigger. Even online comments bother us when we're sleep deprived. and
never when we're well rested. I would love to say that I never look at
them, except I look at. Well actually, here I. [Matthew] Maybe every
one of them. Here I will editorialize because the notion of not
looking at comments is unreasonable to ask of any academic, because
academics we are all trained to look at our teaching evaluations. And
just like with online comments to ignore 20% of them, no, I'm kidding.
We look at them all in any event. So in terms of translating this to
behavior, I'm not, I don't particularly enjoy alcohol, I guess I might
be fortunate in that sense. But I also have never really experienced
the pleasure of drinking alcohol. I sometimes like the taste of a
drink, but I never like the sensation. So that's, I don't have a lot
of familiarity with this, but many people do, and I understand that.
So let's say somebody enjoys a glass of wine or two with dinner and
they eat dinner at 7pm. Is that likely to disrupt their sleep at all?
Let's just sort of, let's make this a series of gradations. And the
answer is yes. I think once they just looked at a single glass of wine
in the evening with dinner, and I would be untruthful if I didn't just
simply say it has an effect. And we can measure that in terms of. Less
REM sleep. Less REM sleep and one of the fascinating studies I can't
remember what dose I think they got them close to a standard illegal
blood alcohol level, so maybe they were a little bit tipsy. And yes,
you see all of the changes that we just described, they sort of lose
consciousness more quickly, they have fragmented sleep, and they have
a significant reduction in REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=4470"&gt;Growth Hormone &amp;amp; Testosterone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was also interesting because REM sleep, as we spoke about
before, is a time when some hormonal systems are essentially recharged
and refreshed growth hormone being one of them, there was well over a
50% five zero drop in their growth hormone release during alcohol
laced sleep at night. And growth hormone is so vital for metabolism
and repair of tissues. Yeah, it's not just for kids. [Andrew] Keeping
body fat low. This is essential in adults. It's essential, along those
lines, I just want to highlight the fact that this information that
you're sharing that growth hormone is released is strongly tethered to
the presence of healthy amounts of REM sleep is interesting to me,
because I always thought the growth hormone was released in the early
part of the night. Well, it is released across both of those, but
across the different stages, but what we also know is that when you
disrupt REM sleep, there are those growth hormone consequences. So
it's not an exclusive system just like with testosterone, we can see
changes throughout non REM sleep, but if you ask when are the peak
release rates of testosterone, it's right before we go into REM sleep,
and then during REM sleep. And of course, testosterone being
important, both for males and females. For men and women, yeah. Right,
for libido and tissue repair and well being. Nobody, regardless of
chromosomal, hormonal, or any other background wants to have their
normal levels of testosterone reduced acutely, that's just a bad it
equates to a terrible set of psychological and physical symptoms.
Yeah, and the mortality risk that's associated with low testosterone
is non trivial. - Prostate cancer. Right, exactly, you know. So coming
back to just the point on REM sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=4574"&gt;Emotions, Mental Health &amp;amp; Longevity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that you mentioned regarding emotional instability, and we see that
that's one of the things one of the most reliable signatures of just
insufficient sleep doesn't have to be sleep deprivation. What we've
discovered over the past 20 years here at The Sleep Center, is that
there is no major psychiatric disorder that we can find in which sleep
is normal. And so I think that firstly told us there is a very
intimate association between your emotional mental health and your
sleep health. But when it also comes to REM sleep, I think what's
fascinating is that it's not just about your emotional health, it's
not just about your hormonal health we've also been seeing other
aspects of you know, cognition. But then there was a report, I think
it could have been about two years ago, out of Harvard, I think it was
Beth Clements group. They found that, and they replicated it in two
different large populations. If you look at the contribution of
different sleep stages to your lifespan, REM sleep was the strongest
predictor of your longevity. And it was a linear relationship. It
wasn't it sort of one of these U shaped or J shaped curves that we
often see with total sleep, and mortality risk, it really was linear.
That the less and less REM sleep that you were getting the higher and
higher your probability of death. And then they did. Was that death
due to natural causes or accident? 'Cause I can imagine if you're not
getting enough REM sleep, you're more likely to drive off the freeway,
step off a cliff. I think it was all cause mortal. You just make bad
decisions about anything in love relationships, which can also be life
threatening. Yeah, I've tried to lean into that and claim that with
those bad relationship situations, oh, I just didn't have enough REM
sleep last night. Blame it on the sleep. [Matthew] My darling you
know. The REM sleep difference. And, but she's far wiser than I
thought. But, so they did this great machine learning analysis and I
may get these numbers backwards. But I think for every 5% reduction in
REM sleep, there was a 13% associated increased risk of mortality. And
I could have, I'll have to go back and check. But to me, and in the
machine learning algorithm, what they ultimately spat out was that of
all of the sleep stages, REM sleep is the most predictive of your
longevity of your lifespan. So we often, I hear people saying, how can
I get more deep sleep? Or they sometimes say how can I get more dream
sleep? And my answer is a question. Why do you want to get more of
that? And they'll say, well, isn't that the good stuff? And I'll say,
well, actually all stages have good sleep. It's all the good stuff.
Well, it's like the exercise question and it took decades, for people
to understand that moving around for about 150, probably 180 minutes a
week at doing endurance type work, zone two cardio type work, it is
correlated with living longer, feeling better, less diabetes,
etcetera. There's really no way around it. I mean, you can ingest
Metformin until the cows come home, you can take NMN, all of which I
think have their place in certain contexts I'm a big fan of the work
surrounding all those protocols. Yeah likewise. - But without getting
proper amounts of movement, meaning sufficient numbers, it doesn't
matter how many 12 minute exercise regimes you follow per week, you
need that threshold level. And it sounds like the same is true of REM
sleep and total amount of sleep. There's just you pay the piper
somehow. Yeah, the return on investment I mean, to flip the coin, the
return on investment is astronomical, you know, I think of sleep it is
the tide that moves, you know, that raises all of those health boats.
And the most fundamental layer of mental and physical health. Whenever
people ask me, even though I'm not a physician, they'll ask me, you
know, what should I take or what should I do? The first question is
always, how's your sleep? Great, I love it. Meaning how well do you
sleep every night and how long do you sleep? And I always recommend
your book, I always recommend your podcast, you know, the podcasts
you've been a guest on, etcetera. Who knows, maybe you'll even release
your own podcast at some point soon and keep because I do think people
need to hear from you more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=4840"&gt;Books vs. Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I don't want to return to the notion of public health
discourse too much. But I do want to say one issue with books in
general, is that they can be revised, but it's more or less a one and
done kind of thing until the next book comes out. Yeah, yeah - One
thing I like about the podcast format is that updates can be provided
regularly. Corrections and updates as new data come out. And so that's
a wonderful aspect to this format. And hopefully the format that
you'll be embracing, I think the world needs to hear more from you
more often, about sleep, and its various contours, not less. And so I
do have a question about drinking alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=4880"&gt;Lunchtime Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that we want to promote day drinking, but let's say that the one
or two glasses of wine or cocktail is consumed with lunch, something
that isn't traditionally done nowadays, or in a late afternoon happy
hour type cocktail. And then one is going to sleep seven or eight
hours later, do you think that that will improve or somehow mitigate
the effects of alcohol? Or if you have a drink, are you are you
basically screwed for the next 24 hours? No, I think there's going to
be a time window dependency. Now, I don't know of anyone who has
essentially done what you and I would like, which is the time
separation dose dependent curve, where okay, you drink at 10am, then
or 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five all the way up to you know, 10pm
and estimate, what is the blast radius? And is it linear? Or is it
nonlinear? Is it such that only when you drink in the last four hours?
Do you just hit this exponential and it's bad, bad bad? Or is there
some other curve that we could imagine there will be many
possibilities. But certainly what we know is that the less alcohol and
the less and more specifically the metabolic byproducts, aldehydes and
ketones, they're the sort of the nefarious players. And not the
ketones that people are all excited about the other ketones, [cross
talking] the chemists know what we're referring to. But this is not
about ketogenesis, please don't think that. This is not about
ketogenesis, there are ketone bodies, and that are released after
ingesting alcohol that are not of the positive sort that a ketogenic
diet might promote. Right, so I think in terms of that alcohol
profile, we certainly know that, you know, as you're heading into the
evening hours, once again, timing and dose make the poison. But I
think it's also important, once again, from that public message
standpoint, and thank you, I think I am leaning into the sort of the
podcast consideration arena, at some point, but I don't want to be
puritanical here, you know, I'm just a scientist, and I'm not here to
tell anyone how to live. All I'm trying to do is empower people with
some of the scientific literature regarding sleep. And then you can
make whatever informed choices that you want. Now, unlike you, it
turns out, I'm not a big drinker. It's just because I've never liked
the taste. And I'm surprised that they haven't taken away my British
passport because I don't like lager or beer. But I also want to say
that life is to be lived to a certain degree, it's all about checks
and balances. So, you know, if I go out and you know, I have an ice
cream sundae, I'm not big on those either, but, you know, sure, I know
that my you know, blood glucose is not going to be ideal for another
12 hours maybe. That's just the price you pay for having some kind of
relaxed, fun life. I don't want to look back on life and think, gosh,
you know, I lived until I was, you know, 111 and it was utterly
miserable you know. Right. - So, but it's all about some kind of a
balance. And my job is not to tell people a prescription for life,
it's just to offer some scientific information. No, I think you're
doing a terrific job of that. People are I always say we have all
these neural circuits and if it's working properly, we all have a
circuit that allows us to skip over information or as we wish, right,
if the circuits between your brain and your thumbs are working you can
slide right along you can drop to the next content however you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=5100"&gt;Marijuana/CBD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to ask about marijuana and CBD. This is a discussion that
I think five years ago would have ventured into the realm of illegal
but now in many places not all medical marijuana is approved or is
legal. And certainly it's in widespread use. Certainly not
recommending people do it. I have my own thoughts about marijuana CBD.
I've been fortunate, I suppose that I don't particularly like
marijuana or CBD. I don't even know if I've ever tried CBD. First of
all, does marijuana disrupt the depth of sleep, the architecture of
sleep? And if so, as with alcohol and caffeine does when you ingest it
or when it's in your bloodstream does, relative to when you go to
sleep, does that play an important role? So does marijuana disrupt
sleep? Yeah, it does. And there's a pretty good amount of data on so
we can break sort of cannabis down into two of its key ingredients.
We've got THC tetrahydrocannabinol, and we've got CBD and CBD is sort
of the less psychotic what we think of as the non psychoactive
components. In other words, when you take CBD, you don't get high. If
you take THC, you can get high. That's the psychoactive part of the
equation. Are both considered sedatives in the technical sense? No,
they're not. Neither of them have that class right now. THC can, seems
to speed up the time with which you fall asleep. But again, if you
look at the electrical brainwave signature of you're falling asleep
with and without that THC, it's not going to be an ideal fit. So you
could argue it's non natural, but many people use THC for that fact,
because they find it difficult to fall asleep. And it can speed the
onset of at least non consciousness, I guess is the best way of
describing it. But there are problems with THC. And they are twofold.
The first is that it too, but through different mechanisms seems to
block REM sleep. And that's why a lot of people when they're using
will tell me look, you know, I definitely, I was dreaming. Or I don't
remember, you know many of my dreams. And then when they stop using
THC, let's say I was having, you know, just crazy, crazy dreams and
the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism. REM sleep is very
clever. And alcohol is the same way in this sense, it's the same
homeostatic mechanism. Some people will tell me, look, if I have a bit
of a wild Friday night with some alcohol, you know, maybe I'll sleep
late into the next morning. And I'll just have these really intense
dreams. So and I thought I wasn't having any REM sleep, well, the way
it works is that it's during in the middle of the night, really, when
alcohol blocks your REM sleep. And your brain is smart it understands
how much REM sleep you should have had, how much REM sleep you have
not because the alcohol has been in the system. And finally, in those
early morning hours, when you're getting through to sort of, you know,
[cross talking] six, seven, 8:00am all of a sudden, your brain not
only goes back to having the same amount of REM it would have had, it
does that plus it tries to get back all of the REM sleep that it's
lost. Does it get back all of the REM sleep? No, it doesn't. It never
gets back all of the REM sleep, but it tries. And so you have these
really intense periods of REM sleep. Hence you have really intense
bizarre dreams. And that's what happens also with THC, you build up
this pressure for REM sleep, this debt for REM sleep, will you ever
pay it back? Doesn't seem as though you get back everything that you
lost, but will you get back some of it? Yes, the brain will start to
devour more because it's been starved of REM sleep for so long. But
one of the bigger problems with THC that we worry about is withdrawal
dependency. So as you start to use THC for sleep, there can be a
dependency tolerance. So you start to need more to get the same sleep
benefit. And when you stop using, you usually get a very severe
rebound insomnia. And in fact, it's so potent that it's typically part
of the clinical withdrawal profile from THC from cannabis. And there's
anxiety withdrawal. I you know, I don't ask anybody to change their
behavior, we just as you said, we try and inform people about what the
science says and let them make choices for themselves. People who are
regular pot smokers, if you many of will insist they're not addicted,
and maybe indeed they don't actually follow the profile of classical
addiction, I don't know. I'm guessing some do, some don't. But if you
ask them well, what if I took away all marijuana consumption for, I
don't know, two weeks? That thought scares many of them. And many of
them will experience intense anxiety without marijuana, which speaks
to perhaps not addiction, but a certain kind of dependency. And again,
you know, I know many pot smokers, some of whom have jobs that are
quite high performing and they manage. Here in Berkeley, I don't know
any of those. Yeah, none of those, right. What about CBD? I mean, we
hear so much about CBD, I've been a little concerned about the fact
that the analysis of a lot of CBD supplements out there has confirmed
that much like with melatonin, the levels that are reported on the
labels, in no way shape, or form, match the levels that are actually
contained in the various supplements. Sometimes the levels are much
higher than they're reported on the labels. Other times, it's much
lower. What does ingesting CBD do to the architecture and quality of
sleep? Right now, I don't think we have enough data to make some kind
of, you know, meaningful sense out of it. I think the picture that is
emerging, however, is probably the following. Firstly, CBD does not
seem to be detrimental in the same ways that THC is. So we can start
by saying does it create you know, potential problems, not of the
nature necessarily that we see with THC. But the devil is a little bit
in the details from the data that we do have and it comes on to your
valid point of purity. At low dose, CBD can seem to be wake promoting.
So in lower doses, let see sort of five or 10 milligrams and trying to
remember some of the studies off the top of my head, there it actually
may enhance wakefulness and cause problems with sleep. It's only once
you get into the higher dose range, that there seem to have been some,
you know, increases sorry, increases in sleepiness, or sort of
sedation like, increases. And that's usually I think, above about 25
milligrams, as best I can recall from the data. And then when we look
in animal models, you typically see the same type of profile too. So
then the question becomes and now again, you just don't know about,
you know, purity. It's very difficult, although I think, and again,
I'm not a user, not necessarily because I you know, have anything
against it. It's just that's not, you know, necessarily my cup of tea.
There are some firms that are now doing third party independent
laboratory tests. I don't know how gamed that is, so I've got no sense
of it. I think some supplement companies are quite honest and accurate
about the amounts of various substances that are in their products and
some are not. And I think there's just a huge range. I think the FDA
is starting to explore CBD there I certainly I saw some grant
announcements to explore the function of CBD. Most of the work on CBD
is being done by the general public adjusting it and seeing how they
feel. I gave it to my dog who was had some dementia related sleep
disturbances, and it actually created a heightened wakefulness it
completely screwed up his sleep. Okay, it sounds as though it just
wasn't. He's a bulldog. So if he's going to get access to sleep, he's
going to take it. Okay. - Really messed him up, took him took it away,
he did better. But you know, that's a canine, so. Right, and it could
have been, you know, sort of dose related too. Or binders or other
things that are in there, sure. Correct, yeah and we, but right now,
if we were to, and I'm not making the statement, I don't think anyone
can make the statement now. But if it ends up being that CBD is
potentially beneficial for sleep, how can we reconcile that
mechanistically? And I think there are, to me, at least, there are at
least three candidate mechanisms that I've been exploring and thinking
about. The first is that it's thermo regulatory. And what we found in
some animal models is that CBD will create a profile of hypothermia.
In other words, it cools the body the core body temperature down. And
that's something that we know is good for sleep. The second is that
it's an anxyolitic, that it can reduce anxiety. And that data is
actually quite strong, even with some functional imaging work that's
been coming out recently showing that one epicenter of emotion called
the amygdala deep within the brain is quietened down with CBD. So I
think that's at least a second non mutually exclusive. That's great,
that's conducive. You know, possibility. I think the third is some
recent data that's come out that was suggesting that CBD can alter the
signaling of adenosine. So it doesn't necessarily mean that you
produce more adenosine, but what it can do is perhaps modulate the
sensitivity perhaps of the brain, so that the weight of that same
adenosine is weightier in its brain signal, and therefore it creates
this stronger pressure for sleep. So I think these are all tentative
mechanisms. I think any one of them is viable, I think all three are
viable together. But right now I think, does that sort of help think
through the tapestry of THC and CBD? Yeah very much so and actually,
it's a perfect segue from we've talked about caffeine, alcohol, THC
and CBD as sort of, we framed them anyway, as things that done in
moderation at the appropriate times, are probably okay for most
people. Certainly not for everybody, there will be differences in
sensitivity. But that done at the incorrect times, and certainly in
the incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt this vital stage of life we
call sleep. CBD, it seems, represents a kind of bridge to the topic
I'd like to talk about next, which is things that promotes more
healthy sleep, or somehow contribute to enhancing the architecture and
quality of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=5760"&gt;Melatonin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'd love to chat for a moment about the kind of grand, the original
I should say that not the granddaddy but the OG of sleep
supplementation, which is melatonin. The so called hormone of darkness
that's inhibited by light, etcetera. Frame for us, melatonin in the
context of its naturally occurring form. And then I'd like to talk
about melatonin the supplement because in my experience, anytime I say
the word melatonin, people think about the supplement melatonin, which
in itself is an interesting phenomenon that people are so cued to its
role as something you take, we often forget that this is something
that we make endogenously. I'd love for you to comment in particular
on even though without necessarily getting into its precise nanograms
per deciliter values, what are the typical amounts of melatonin that
we release each night? And then I'd like to compare that to what is
contained in say a three milligram or six milligram tablet that one
might buy at the pharmacy. Right, yeah. - So I go to sleep at night,
has melatonin already kicked in before I shut my eyes and lay down my
head? Usually, yes, if your system is working in the correct way, as
dusk is starting to happen, so let's say that you look at hunter
gatherer tribes who aren't touched by electricity, and so that's sort
of the puritanical state par excellence when it comes to electric
light influence. And usually, it's as dusk is approaching, that's when
melatonin will start to rise. And so when you lose the brake pedal of
light coming through the eyes, that normally acts like a hard brake
pedal that stamps down and prevents the release and production of
melatonin. As that light brake pedal starts to fade with dusk, then we
ease off the brake pedal and melatonin the spigot of melatonin is
opened up, and melatonin starts getting released. And usually we'll
see this rising peak of melatonin sometime, usually an hour, two hours
later or around and it varies from different people around the time of
sleep itself. But it's already been on the march for some hours before
you actually hit sleep itself. Interesting, and I was always taught
and I'm assuming it's still true that the only source of melatonin in
the brain and body is the pineal gland. Is that still true? Yeah, it
seems to be from best that we can tell the pineal gland sort of
meaning pea like sort of shape. It's actually I think usually people
say it's pea like, I think if you look at the Latin derivative, it's
more, I think it's derived from pine cone, not pea because in fact, if
you look at the pineal, it is more pine cone shaped and so is aptly
named. Any human brain I've ever dissected or I confess I've dissected
a lot 'cause I teach neuroanatomy and have for years. I love looking
at the pineal it's the one structure in the brain that's not on both
sides. It's usually pretty easy to find. And it's a pretty good size.
It looks like a, it looks like a pea. And it's sitting right there.
And it's remarkable that it releases this hormone. Sort of probably
our entire lifespan is inhibited by light. So our pineal starts to
release this into the general circulation. I have to imagine we have
melatonin receptors in the brain and body. It's correct, so yep,
essentially, your brain has a central Master 24 hour clock called the
super charismatic nucleus that keeps internal time. Now it's not a
precise clock if left to its own devices, nothing that a Swiss clock
maker would be proud of. It runs a little bit long and laggy. It's
like an American clock. There are a couple of good American watches by
the way, Hamilton's are very nice, but. It's very much like a bug.
We're not famous for our timekeeping or our punctuality for that
matter, but the Swiss are. It's very it's not quite Swiss, like it's
more Berkeley like, which is very relaxed. Oh you know what whatever.
So in most adults, the average adult, I should say, your biological
clock normally runs a little bit long, it's about 24 hours and 30
minutes, I think was the last calculation. But the reason that we
don't keep drifting forward in time and kind of running consistently,
you know, more and later and later, 30 minutes by 30 minutes by 30
minutes each day, is because your central brain clock is regulated by
external things such as daylight and temperature, as well as food and
activity. All of these are essentially different fingers that come
along and on the wristwatch of the 24 hour clock will pull the dial
out and reset it each day to precisely 24 hours. And I make that point
because it knows 24 hour time, but it needs to tell the rest of the
brain and the body, the 24 hour time as well. And one of the ways that
it does this is by communicating a chemical signal of 24 hour nurse of
light and day using this hormone, melatonin. And when it is at low
levels, or it's non existent, it's communicating the message it's
daytime, and for us diurnal species, it says it's time to be awake.
Yet, at nighttime, when dusk approaches and the break comes off
melatonin and we start to release it, then it signals to the rest of
the brain and the body, look, it's dusk and it's nighttime. And for us
diurnal species, it's time to think about sleep. So melatonin
essentially tells the brain and the body when it's day and when it's
night, and with that when it's time to sleep when it's time to wake.
And therefore, that's why melatonin helps with the timing of the onset
of sleep. But it doesn't really help with the generation of sleep
itself. And this is why we'll come on to what those studies of
supplementation have taught us. So it tells the rest of my brain and
body, it's time to go to sleep. It perhaps even aids with the
transition to sleep but it's not going to for instance, ensure the
overall structure of sleep or it's not the conductor that's guiding
the sleep orchestra so to speak throughout the entire night. Yeah,
it's. - It's more like the people that essentially take you to your
seat and sit you down and give you your program. Right, exactly yeah,
sort of the the fall, less sophisticated analogy I have is, you know,
melatonin is like the starting official at the 100 meter race in the
Olympics. That's a better analogy, yeah. It calls all of the sleep
racers to the line and it begins the great sleep race. Yeah, better
analogy by the way. [Matthew] It doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no,
no. Coming from the sleep researcher of all people. But it doesn't
participate in the race itself. That's a whole different set of brain
chemicals and brain regions. Which then brings us on to perhaps the
question of supplementation, which is, is it helpful for my sleep?
Will I sleep longer? Will I sleep better? And if I am, what dosage
should I be taking? Sadly, the evidence in healthy adults who are not
older age suggests that melatonin is not really particularly helpful
as a sleep aid. I think there's a recent meta analysis that
demonstrated when it looked at all of the different sleep parameters,
melatonin, and a meta analysis for those not knowing what that is,
it's a scientific sort of method that we use where we gather all the
individual studies and we put them in a big bucket and we kind of do
this kind of statistical fancy sleight of hand. And we try to come up
with a big picture of what all of those individuals studies tell us.
And what that meta analysis told us is that melatonin will only
increase total amount of sleep by 3.9 minutes, on average. Minutes? -
[Matthew] Minutes. Not even percent. And it will only increase your
sleep efficiency by 2.2%. So it really. This is as they say, in
certain parts of California, that's weak sauce, that's a weak sauce
effect. The sauce is not strong, the force is not strong in this one,
when it comes to a tool that in healthy people who are not of older
age, it doesn't seem to be especially beneficial. Now, you know,
results can vary. Everyone is different, of course. So we're talking
about the average, the so called average human adult here. Well,
melatonin, in defense of what you're saying and also I should mention,
I have a colleague at Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. Oh, wonderful, genius.
Chuck Seitzer's lab at Harvard Med where he also trained terrific
sleep researcher and I asked him about melatonin and he essentially
said the same thing that you just said which is very little if any
evidence that it can improve sleep and yet it's probably the most
commonly consumed so called sleep aid. Hundreds of million dollars
industry. Yeah, so either massive placebo effect or it's operating
through some other mechanism related to quelling anxiety perhaps?
Well, yeah, that's essentially interesting, you know, there are some
studies where you do see some, you know, effects. Now, again, when you
do the grand average of all studies, it just doesn't seem to have an
effect. But let's assume that for some people, it does have an effect
let's not again be sort of completely dismissive of that, how could it
have that effect? One of the reasons that I've become a little bit
more bullish on melatonin from a sleep perspective and then melatonin
more generally for a, maybe you can speak about this too, as a counter
measure when you're undergoing insufficient sleep. There are two
different routes there. The first reason that I think it could have a
sleep benefit for some people is not because it helps in the
generation of sleep, we know that it doesn't, it's because it too
seems to drop core body temperature. There it is, temperature again.
I'm fascinated these days, more and more by temperature, as maybe not
just a reflection of brain state and wakefulness and in sleep, but
actually a lever that is quite powerful. I think it's both. And with
all the interest in ice baths and hot showers and saunas and stuff,
something that we will definitely touch on. Temperature variation is
so key. So if melatonin is dropping body temperature by a degree or so
something that you've said before can help induce a sleepy state.
Maybe that's what's allowing people to get in to sleep. I think that's
one possibility. I don't think melatonin by itself will drop it by it
sort of, you know, a degree, certainly not a degree Celsius. And for
order in us to fall asleep, and then stay asleep across the night, we
do need to drop our core body temperature by about one degree Celsius,
or about two to three degrees Fahrenheit. And that's why it's always
easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. I think
that that's one potential avenue that we are considering thinking more
deeply about when it comes to melatonin. And then the other is
melatonin as an antioxidant. But let me table that for now. 'Cause
I'll just get us sidetracked. That's what we know so far about
melatonin in terms of its supplementation benefit or lack thereof. Two
final points that I shouldn't forget, one is the only population where
we typically see some benefit, and it often is prescribed is in older
adults, because as we. Older meaning 60 and older? Yeah, 60, 65 and
older because as we get older, you can typically have what's called
calcification of the pineal gland. Which means that that gland that's
releasing melatonin doesn't work as well anymore. As a consequence,
they tend to have a flatter overall curve of melatonin release
throughout the night. It's not this beautiful, lovely peak, and this
bullhorn message of its darkness, please get to sleep. That's why
older adults can have problems falling asleep or staying asleep. It's
not the only reason by any stretch of the imagination. But it's one of
the reasons and it's why melatonin supplementation in those cohorts,
older adults, and especially older adults with insomnia, people have
thought about that as maybe an appropriate use case. Well, along those
lines, if we were to compare dosages, I don't, do we know how much
melatonin is typically released into the bloodstream per night? And
can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb by which to compare the
typical amount that someone would supplement? Typically, the
supplements for melatonin that I see in the pharmacy and elsewhere
online range anywhere from one milligram to 12, or even 20 milligrams.
My guess is that a normal night's release of melatonin typical for
somebody in their 20s, 30s, 40s would be far lower than that, am I
correct or wrong? Yeah, it's many magnitudes lower. And this is one of
the problems is that I see that too. I see, you know, typical doses
are, you know, five milligrams or 10 milligrams and of course, you
know, if you're a supplement company, you know, putting 10 milligrams
versus five milligrams, if that's what you're actually doing, which
we'll speak about purity as well. You know, it's kind of like the
super gulp size, nobody wants to lower price, they just want you to
you know, we'll just give you more for the same price. And that's how
we'll compete. So it's been this escalating arms race of melatonin
concentration, and it really does not look meaningful for, you know,
for sleep in any way. What we've actually found is that the optimal
doses for where you do get sleep benefits in the populations that
we've looked at, are somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 milligrams of
melatonin. In other words, the typical doses are usually 10 times, 20
times maybe more than what your body would naturally expect. And this
is what we call a supra physiological dose. In other words, it's far
above what is physiologically normal? You know, and to put that in
context, imagine I said to you, I want you to eat 20 times as much
food today. I thought you're going to use testosterone as example.
You're going to take 300 times the normal amount of testosterone we
know that would have tons of deleterious effects it would be terrible.
And yet you can do this. One thing that I'm concerned about about
these super physiological levels of melatonin is that many years ago,
actually, here at Berkeley, when I was a graduate student, we would
inject animals which were seasonally breeding animals with melatonin.
And the consequence of that was that their gonads, either their testes
or ovaries would shrink, many hundred fold or more. In other words,
they would go from having nice healthy sized hamster testicles, what a
hamster would consider healthy size for a hamster and they would
shrink to the size of a grain of rice. So from like an almonds to a
grain size of a grain of rice. I had to see that only once for me to
be very concerned about super physiological levels of melatonin. And I
realized that melatonin does different things in different species. We
are not hamsters, we are not seasonal breeders seasonally restricted
breeders, there might be more breeding during certain seasons, I don't
know those data. But nonetheless, hormones are powerful. And sure
there is an optimal, and sometimes we see that going slightly above
endogenous levels for certain hormones not always, can have beneficial
effects. And sometimes it can have detrimental effects. I'm just
concerned about taking high levels of a hormone that has effects on
the reproductive axis and that's one of the reasons why I get very
concerned when I see people really getting aggressive about melatonin
supplementation taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times the
amount that we would normally release. That's my concern, although
it's not nested in any one specific human study. I just don't like to
see, I certainly don't want to see other people and I don't want to
personally take a hormone that's known to be androgen suppressive at
high levels. Why would I take that? That's the question I ask myself.
I think it's a very, you know, good point. And if you look at some of
the evidence around, you know, melatonins lethality if you want to go
to that extreme, for the most part, you know, it's pretty safe. You
mean, you can take a lot of it before you die? Right, exactly yeah.
But I don't know that that's the criteria. That should be your
yardstick for, because, you know, you really need to think about your,
you know, your health, not just whether this thing is going to kill
you or not as the decision matrix through which you pop a pill. And it
comes on to this concern around melatonin because there was a study, I
think it's one that you mentioned too where they looked at over, I
think it was at least over 20 different brands of melatonin
supplements. And what they found is that based on what it said, on the
bottle versus what was in the capsules themselves, it ranged from, I
think it was 83% less than what it said on the bottle to 478% more
than what it said on the bottle. Now, if that's a 10 milligram, you
know, pill, and it's 478% more than 10 milligrams, and we're already
at 10 milligrams at many tens of times more than is a physiological
rather than a supra physiological dose, we do need to be a bit
thoughtful. Yeah, remember those hamsters folks. Well, and I do
appreciate the deep dive on melatonin because I think people need to
understand that it's nuanced, it's a matter of dosages, and timing,
etcetera. And then it may have its place as you mentioned in older
individuals. And I should mention that I'm an avid consumer of
supplements that I believe in for me and I have been for a very long
time. So I'm by no means anti supplement. Some supplements I refuse to
take or avoid taking others I quite avidly take and along those lines,
I personally and I don't know what your thoughts on this are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=6854"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are a few things that I've personally found beneficial. I
love your thoughts on them. And I would love it if you would tell me
that everything I'm about to refer to is placebo, that would be fine.
So that's what we do, we're scientists we argue and then we remain
friends in as it goes away. So magnesium, there are many forms of
magnesium. Magnesium citrate is a as we know, is a terrific laxative.
Magnesium malate seems, at least from a few studies seems to relieve
some of delayed onset muscle soreness doesn't seem to create a kind of
sedation. Two forms of magnesium that I'm aware of magnesium
biglycinate and magnesium threonate. We believe based on the data can
more actively cross the blood brain barrier. So you put in your gut,
but some of that needs to go into your brain in order to have the
sedative effect. What are your thoughts on magnesium supplementation?
Do you supplement with magnesium? And what studies would you like to
see done if they haven't been done already. So I don't supplement with
magnesium. But I do think threonate is interesting because of that
higher capacity to cross the blood brain barrier and actually have a
central nervous system effect. And the reason that that interests me
is because the sleep is by the brain of the brain, and also for the
brain, as well as for the body. We just don't have a particularly good
set of studies that have targeted exclusively threonate. We do have
lots of studies that have just looked at magnesium in general for
sleep. And overall, the data is uncompelling. Interesting. - And for a
while, I was confused as to why, where did this come from this kind of
myth of magnesium? So I started looking back into the literature and
I've best traced it at least as far as I can tell, to early studies
showing that those who are deficient in magnesium also had sleep
problems. They had other problems too, of course, but sleep problems
were one of that set of sequelae that came from having lower
magnesium. And when they supplemented with magnesium and tried to
restore those levels, some of those sleep problems dissipated. And
then that seems to have gotten lost in sort of some game of sort of
like whispers around the room and it's become translated into people
who don't have sleep problems, who are healthy sleepers, and who are
healthy in general, and who have healthy normal levels of magnesium,
if they take more magnesium, they will sleep better. And the data
really, there is not good. Once again, the only study that I've seen
where magnesium did have some efficacy was in a study with older
adults, I think they were 60 to 80 years old, it may have been
exclusively women, now I think about it and they also had insomnia.
And in that population, you did see some benefits. And my guess is
that because it's an older community as well, they were probably
deficient in magnesium. So they fit the former category of simply when
you're deficient, and you restore, you can help sleep sort of return
to normal. But if you are not deficient and you're healthy, and you're
not old and you don't have insomnia, and you're supplementing thinking
that it provides sleep, right now, the data isn't supportive of that.
But I just don't think we have enough threonate data to actually speak
about that, because it could just be a blood brain barrier issue so
far with the other forms. So maybe some additional studies looking
specifically at threonate or bi-glycinate would be useful. - I'd love
to have. Magnesium is involved in so many cellular processes, you can
imagine that this effect, if it truly exists is, as we say, in science
in the noise, meaning it's in the jitter of the data, but to isolate
the real effect one needs to do some more refined studies. What are
some things that are of interest to you, if not things that you happen
to take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=7090"&gt;Valerian, Kiwi, Tart Cherry, Apigenin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not things that I personally take mostly because I just
haven't experimented with them. valerian root is one, tart cherry and
kiwi fruit. Tell me about Valerian root, tart cherry and kiwi fruit.
This is new to me. I have certainly heard of them. And tart cherry and
Kiwi sounds delicious, but what's happening with Valerian root tart
cherry and kiwi and are we talking about eating tart cherries and
Kiwis and Valerian roots? - Yes. Or are talking about taking them in
pill form? Usually it's supplements, but it's also both for tart
cherries and for kiwis. It's the actual, you know, fruit themselves.
Valerian often touted as a beneficial sleep aid and lots of people
swear by it too. But the evidence is actually quite against that. Oh
really? - Not that it makes your sleep worse, but of at least the
seven good studies that I've been able to find, and typically these
are of the nature of what we call a randomized placebo crossover
design. And I won't bore people with what that means it's sort of one
of the. Good studies, solid studies. Yeah, it's one of the sort of
gold standard methods that we have when we're looking at intervention
studies such as drugs studies. Five of the seven found no benefits of
Valerian root on sleep. Then two out of the seven, the data was just
insufficient. I think it was a power issue where they just couldn't
make any strong conclusions. And then I think there was the most
recent study, I think looked at two different doses of Valerian and I
could have this wrong and they just failed to find any effects once
again, but the stunning part of that paper, as I recall, they had this
big table with all of the different sleep metrics that they looked at.
And there were well over 25 different things that they tried to see if
valerian impacted. And none of them were significant. Which stuns me
because from statistical probabilities, we know, if you just randomly
perform 25 statistical tests, chances are probabilistically, you'll
just get one significant result by random chance. And even with random
chance on their side, they still couldn't find a benefit of Valerian,
so. So Valerian root might be worse than nothing at all, if there is,
so to speak. I mean, again, placebo effect we can think about that
too. And I would say that if you feel as though it's having a benefit
for you, and with all of the caveats that we have with supplements,
things like melatonin purity, concentration, et cetera, you know,
maybe it's no harm no foul. But I'm not a you know, a medical doctor
and I don't tell anyone about we have all of these disclaimers about
not recommending such things. And we'll include these, I mean, I
always say, you know, we're not physicians, we don't prescribe
anything. We're scientists and professors so we profess things. It's
up to people to be responsible for their own health. Not just to
protect us but to protect themselves. I do want to hear about tart
cherry and kiwi fruit. What's the story there? Strange, isn't it? I
was, you know, I'm kind of a hard nosed scientist, and when people you
know, some years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, it's the thing
or kiwi fruits, I was thinking, oh, my goodness, the sounds a bit.
You've been in California a little too long. Yeah, I know, yeah, the
sun is softened me some. But I thought, look one of the things that we
have to do as scientists is be as open minded as possible. And I
should not be so quick to dismiss. So I went to the literature just
started reading as much as I could about it. And there were three
really good randomized placebo crossover trials with tart cherries.
And what they found was that in one study, it reduced the amount of
time that you spent awake at night by over an hour. And then the other
two studies, one of them found that it increased the amount of sleep
that you've got by 34 minutes. The other it increased the amount of
sleep that you got by 84 minutes. Which you know, these are, and
what's striking is that they were independent studies, I think,
meaning that they were from independent groups, and these were, you
know, some of these guys, you know, and girl, I know pretty well, and
they are really. You know and trust their work. Right, I really trust
their work too. Were they ingesting actual tart cherries or they're
drinking the juice or in capsule form? It was juice. So they in all
three studies, it was juice. Although you can I think as a supplement,
you can buy it in a capsule, and we've got no idea whether that
changes the benefit or not. What was also interesting in I think it
was that last study where they got an increase in sleep by 84 minutes,
it also decreased a daytime napping significantly. That's one that I
could certainly make use of. I love my day time naps, but I'd love to
skip them too. Right and we can speak about naps and sort of the
upside and downside of that. Which then made me think well, if that's
the case, may be the net net benefit on sleep overall, is no
different. It's just that it decreases the amount of time that some
people were taking to sleep during the day, and giving it back to the
night. But that wasn't the case, 'cause if you added the total amount
of sleep that they were getting without tart cherries, both naps and
nightly sleep combined, still, when you took tart cherries, you still
got a net some benefit, of total amount of sleep. So you know, so far,
when it comes to supplements, and those types of studies, they're good
studies, and the data looks interesting. But as a drug itself, you
know, if this was clinical drug, you know, three studies that are
somewhat small in nature and have some positive benefit that's what we
would call preliminary data of maybe a chin scratching kind so keep
this in context. Yeah, and depending on the margins for safety, one
might think, well, given that it's a tart cherry as opposed to some
pharmaceutical you need a prescription for then, you know, some people
their threshold to experiment with supplements is quite low, some
people their threshold is quite high. I feel like you know, there are
two categories, or at least two categories of folks out there. People
who hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, and we'll run out and try
it. And people who hear well, that sounds crazy. Why would I do that?
But of course, we have to remind people that tart cherry isn't really
what we're talking about, presumably if this is a real effect, and
sounds like it might be that there's a compound in tart cherries.
That's right. - That if we were to call it, whatever, whatever five
alpha six, you know, some molecule, if we refer to it by its technical
name, then people would say, oh, that sounds like a very interesting
technical way to approaches sleep but doesn't sound very natural. So
both groups are a little bit misguided in the sense that people who
think that everything that comes from naturally occurring foods,
plants, etcetera, things that grow out of the ground, that that's all
safe, that's not true. And people that think that pharmaceuticals are
the if it's not evidence with the purified molecule, then something's
not of utility. Well, that's certainly not true. somewhere in the
middle, I think lies the answer, which is, it sounds to me like tart
cherry is at least an intriguing potential sleep aid. Intriguing
potential sleep aid and underscoring potential. I'm certainly
intrigued by it to the point where I might experiment a bit, but I'm
an experimenter for myself. Before I ask you about kiwi, I've had
quite good results from taking something called apigenin, which is a
derivative of chamomile. But in supplement form, I think I take 50
milligrams about 30 minutes before sleep. And I subjectively
experience a better night's sleep, so to speak. I don't measure I
confess, I don't measure my sleep. I'm not a sleep tracker guy. But,
you know, there are a few papers out there they're not what we would
call blue published in Blue Ribbon journals, but they have control
groups, and it looks somewhat interesting. And there when I say
apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh this molecule. Chamomile has
long been thought to be a sedative, a mild sedative, but a sedative?
Do you drink chamomile tea? Do you take apigenin? What are your
thoughts on apigenin? Yeah, I don't. And I have looked into some of
the data regarding sleep as well. Right now from best I can tell it's
mostly subjective data rather than objective hard sort of sleep
measures. And that's why right now I you know, it's sort of unclear
not no comment, but just unclear, not dismissing it, because I think
you and I both ascribe to the idea of absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence. So keep your mind open, at least I tell that to
myself. I think if you're finding a benefit, and you can do what I
would think of if I was personally experimenting, which is both the
positive and negative parts of the experiment, what I mean by that is,
you know, let's say that I now want to, you know, think about some
kind of sleep supplement, I will take some kind of baseline set of
recordings for a month, and I will just gauge where I'm at, sort of
supplement free. Then I'll go on for a month or two, whatever I'm
thinking of taking, and I don't, you know, supplement. But let's say
that I want to and I experiment with that. And I feel as though based
on my metrics be them objective from my aura ring or be them
subjective from whatever I'm, you know, writing down in the morning,
and both are important and valid, subjective and objective, we like
both in the sleep world. And I think, okay, look, it's clearly that it
seems to have some kind of an effect. The key thing, however, is then
do the negative experiment, which is now come off it for another
month, and see, do things get worse. And if I can see that by
directionality, then I'm starting to think maybe I'm believing this a
little bit more. So that's the way I would sort of typically approach
you know, a supplementation regiment if I were to do it. And that's
just me, that's just the way my mind works, but. No, that's great. I
think it's very scientific and organized in a way that allows you and
would allow other people to make very informed decisions for
themselves. I like that. I like to think in terms of manipulating any
aspect of our biology, that behavioral tools always are the first line
of entry, then nutrition, everyone has to eat sooner or later, even if
you're fasting, then perhaps supplementation, then prescription drugs,
and then perhaps brain machine interface, devices that you use to
induce something. And those can be done in combination. But what
concerns me is when I hear people say, well, what should I take
without thinking about their behavior, their light viewing behavior,
etcetera. But of course, these things work in combination. And I think
it's, you're right, that there's many when it comes to sleep, there
are many low hanging fruits that don't necessarily require you to, you
know, put sort of exogenous molecules in other words things like
supplements into your body or, you know, use different types of drugs
to help you get there. Now, when it comes to prescription sleep aids,
I think I've been again a little bit too forthright. We know in
clinical practice that there may be a time and a place for things like
sleeping pills, they are a short term solution to certain forms of
insomnia, but they are not recommended for the long term. And we also
know that there are lots of other ways that you can get a sleep help
or you can get a sleep curative profile from things like cognitive
behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is a non drug approach,
psychological. And quite effective from what I understand, good data.
Just as effective as sleeping pills, great data more effective in the
long term. There's a recent study published that after working with a
therapist, some of the benefits lasted almost a decade, you know, now,
if you stop sleeping pills, usually you have rebound insomnia, where
your sleep goes back to being just as bad if not worse. And I think
the same is true, when we think about supplementation, there are so
many things that are easy to implement when it comes to sleep, that
don't require venturing out into those waters. And again, we're not
here to tell anyone about whether they should venture or not, that's
completely your choice. All I'm saying is that if you want to think
about optimizing your sleep, there are a number of ways that you can
do it that don't necessarily require you to swallow anything or inject
anything or you know, smoking or anything, or free base. And of which
the margins of safety are quite quite wide. That's the other one. Yes,
right thank you. So speaking of low hanging fruit, I don't know how it
hangs in reality, but what about kiwi? They're delicious to me anyway.
Yeah, the humble kiwi fruit named not shouldn't be mistaken for the
flightless bird of New Zealand, which is the native bird there. We're
talking about the kiwi the fruit here, which those trees and shrubs
are mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits have been previously touted as
potentially having a sleep benefit, which again got me curious and I
at first threw it out. To my knowledge, there's really only one
published human study that's of any value. But what they did find was
that it decreased the speed of time with which it took you to fall
asleep. These are you ingesting the whole kiwi. So it's ingesting the
whole kiwi. With the skin, I eat the skin, people cringe when they see
me, or don't eat the skin? Well, I think, no, no, no, I think the idea
is some of the good stuff and I'll come on to this may actually be in
the skin itself. Oh wonderful, thank you. You just helped me win a
bet. I'll give you your cut. Okay, okay, yeah, you can pay me later.
By the way this skin is use? No, no, no. He just told me to say that's
how he wins, no, he did not. So the skin seems to be part of this
potential sleep equation. And that study, you fell asleep faster and
you stayed asleep for longer and you spent less time awake throughout
the night. And I just thought, well, you know, that's one study, what
can you really do with that? There was another study, however, in an
animal model, which is, you know, a little bit more interesting. And
once again, they found a very similar phenotype that the rats, sorry
they were mice, the mice fell asleep faster. And they also spent
longer time in sleep. The sleep duration also increased. What was also
interesting mechanistically and this is not the mechanism that I think
ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, and you know things like
melatonin, because I think there could be one common binding
mechanism. What they found in the animal study is that they could
block those kiwifruit sleep benefits using a GABA blocking agent. Now
GABA which stands for Gamma Amino Butyric Acid is one of the major
inhibitory neurotransmitters of the brain. It's kind of like the red.
So a naturally occurring sedative, sort of? Yeah, it's the kind of the
red light on the traffic light signal, you know, others are green
light. GABA is red light. So by playing around with some sort of
clever drugs to manipulate the system, they could prevent the benefit
of the kiwi fruit by sort of buggering around with the GABA receptor,
meaning that perhaps part of the kiwi fruit benefit on sleep was
mediated by the brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system
called the GABA system. That's exciting. - And I thought that that was
kind of, that convinced me a little bit more that maybe there's
something here to read into. So to be determined, again, here is the
banner, but you know, tart cherries and kiwi fruits the data surprised
me, because in part I was so preoccupied with being you know, I don't
know a bit pure-ish about and a bit snobby thinking come on, that's
definitely not going to work, well the data certainly found out.
[cross talking] I look forward to a day when supplements are no longer
called supplements, because at the end of the day, whether or not
something has an effect, whether or not it's a whole kiwi fruit or a
derivative of kiwi fruit will depend on the molecular compound. And as
you mentioned, this potential mechanism via the GABA system, we both
as scientists get excited about mechanism 'cause when you can trace a
mechanism and a pathway it provides a rationale a grounding for why
kiwi of all things or tart cherry of all things might help increase
total sleep time. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention or ask about
tryptophan and serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=8100"&gt;Tryptophan &amp;amp; Serotonin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can anecdotally say, when I've taken tryptophan, the precursor to
serotonin, or serotonin itself, I have a horrendous night's sleep. I
fall asleep very easily. And I experience ridiculously vivid dreams.
Neither pleasant nor unpleasant is kind of a mishmash. And then I wake
up and I experience several days of insomnia. That and I've done the
positive control and the negative control and all the variations there
of to confirm that, at least for me supplementing with serotonergic
agents is a bad idea for me. And tryptophan is a common sleep
supplement and sleep aid that's discussed. The normal architecture of
sleep involves the release of serotonin, but in a very timed and
regulated way. What are your thoughts about serotonin in sleep? If you
had to kind of put that into a nutshell. And then why supplementing
with serotonin and or its precursor, tryptophan might be a good or a
bad idea for somebody. I think one of the potential dangers is that
based on what's going on in your body, that can change the absorption
of natural sort of tryptophan and serotonin uptake within the brain
itself. So I'm always thoughtful when you're playing around with that
mother nature dynamic as it were. The data as you described is a
little bit all over the map. Some people say that it knocks them out
other people say just like you do, it has a terrible impact on my
sleep. And when I stop, it's pretty bad for a couple of days, it seems
to have this lingering after effect. I think what could be happening
here is we need serotonin to just as you described, to be modulated in
very specific ways during the different stages of sleep. If you look
at the firing of the brain epicenters where serotonin is released, and
there's a bunch of them in the brainstem, what you find, and the
release of serotonin too, when we're awake, it's usually in high
concentrations, as we start to drift off to sleep, it lowers some, but
not necessarily dramatically as we're going into non REM sleep. But
then when we go into REM sleep serotonin is shut off. The other, one
of the other neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep is
the only time during the 24 hour period, where we see noradrenaline
and serotonin or norepinephrine, completely shut down. When I say
serotonin, we're also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, that's just its
chemical name here. So whether it was speaking about serotonin or 5-HT
is the same thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, both of those need
to be shut down for you to produce REM sleep. The other, one of the
other neuromodulators, that then ramps up to produce REM sleep is
acetylcholine. So these three neuromodulators have this incredible
reciprocal dance that they have for you to generate what is called a
natural architecture of sleep throughout the night. It's the push pull
again. It's a push pull again, you know, it's you know, it's just and
back. It's, you know, whatever you want to think of. That's why I
think if you're trying to increase dramatically drive up your
serotonin levels at night, and that sustains throughout the night,
when you're trying to get into REM sleep, you could be artificially
fragmenting REM sleep. Now, I don't know the data, I don't think
anyone's really got the data. No, I haven been able to find it. But
that's why I would be, you know if you were to say, Matt, two years
time, that's the data helped me understand the potential mechanism or
let's design some experiments, where would you go first? I would say
let's look at the disruption of REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal
regulation, because, you know, you need serotonin to be, you know, up
at one time down at another, so. I agree with everything you said. And
I'm personally never taking tryptophan or serotonin again, unless
there's some clinical reason for that that I would need to do that. I
want to ask about some other pro sleep behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=8364"&gt;Naps &amp;amp; Non-Sleep-Deep-Rest (NSDR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I do that, let's talk about naps. I love naps. I come from
a long history of nappers. My dad always took a nap in the afternoon,
I take a 20 or 30 minute nap or I do a practice which I took the
liberty of coining NSDR, non sleep deep rest, some sort of just
passive laying out their feet up elevated. Sometimes people do you or
I'll do yoga Nidra, I'll do hypnosis or something of that sort, but 20
or 30 minutes of that has been very beneficial for me to get up from
that nap or period of minimal wakefulness, we'll call it and go about
my day quite well, and also fall asleep just fine. What are the data
on naps? Do you nap? And what are your thoughts about keeping naps
short meaning 20 to 30 minutes versus getting out past 90 minutes, two
hours? So for you personally naps, yay, nay or meh? I don't nap. And
I've just never been a habitual napper. Is that because you don't feel
sleepy in the afternoon, or because? I typically don't feel sleepy? So
you're just hardier then. I am, I wouldn't say hardier, I may be less
capable of falling asleep, my sleep drive. But you're not dragging
through the afternoon? No, no, I don't drag through out the. So you
don't nap because you don't feel a need to nap? That's right, yep.
Now, it's not that I am immune to what we call the postprandial dip in
alertness. I definitely feel as though there can be this kind of
afternoon lull, where, you know, I'm not quite as on as I was at 11
o'clock in the morning. And we know the physiology to that, which
brings us back to whether we were designed to nap. So for naps, we've
done lots of different studies and other colleagues have done these
studies too. Naps can have some really great benefits, we found
benefits for cardiovascular health, blood pressure, for example, we
found benefits for levels of cortisol, we found benefits for learning
and memory, and also emotional regulation. How long are the naps,
typically, in those studies? Anywhere between 20 minutes to 90
minutes. Sometimes we like to use a 90 minute window so that the
participant can have a full cycle of sleep, and therefore they get
both non REM and REM sleep within that time period. Then when we wake
them up, we usually wait a period of time to get them past what we
call sleep inertia, which is that kind of window of grogginess where
you say to you, better half look, you know, darling, please don't
speak to me for the first hour after I've. Don't anything right now.
After the first hour of waking up, you know, I'm not just, I'm just
not the best version of myself. So we wait for that time period, and
then we do some testing. And we've done some testing before and after,
and we look at the change. And that's how we measure what was the
benefit of naps and the reason why we sometimes do 90 minutes so that
they get all of those stages of sleep. And then we correlate, how much
benefit did you get from the nap, and how much of that benefit was
explained by what REM sleep you got, what deep sleep you got, what
light sleep you got? So that's the only reason that we use that as an
experimental tool. What we've also found is that naps of as little as
17 minutes can have some quite potent effects on for example,
learning. None of this is novel, NASA pioneered this back in the
1990s. And during the missions, they were experimenting with naps for
their astronauts. And what they found was that naps of little as 26
minutes, improved mission performance by 34%, and improved daytime
alertness by 50%. And it birthed what was then called the NASA nap
culture throughout all terrestrial NASA staff during that time period.
So it's long been known that naps can have a benefit. Naps, however,
can have a double edged sword there is a dark side to naps. And it
comes back to our story of adenosine and sleep pressure. The longer
we're awake, the more of that sleep pressure adenosine that we build
up. But what I didn't tell you is that when we sleep, the brain gets
the chance to essentially clear out that adenosine. And after about 16
hours of wakefulness, and then after about eight hours of sleep, eight
hours of sleep seems to be able to allow the brain to decrease its
adenosine levels back to normal. And so naturally, we should start to
wake up which also aligns with your circadian rhythm. And those are
two separate processes. But with about eight hours of good quality
sleep seven to nine hours for the average adult, we are free of all of
that adenosine. We've evacuated it essentially out of the brain, and
we wake up naturally feeling refreshed. The reason that naps can be
potentially dangerous is that when you nap, you are essentially
opening the valve on the pressure cooker of sleep pressure. And some
of that sleepiness is lost by way of the nap. So for some people and
not all people and you're a great example of this. Some people,
however, if they are struggling with sleep at night, and they nap
during the day, it makes their sleep problems even worse. So for
people with insomnia, we typically advise against napping. And the
advice is if you can nap regularly, and you don't struggle with sleep
at night, then naps are just fine. But if you do struggle with sleep,
stay away from naps. If you are going to nap, try to limit your naps,
try to cut them off a bit like sort of caffeine, maybe you know, eight
to 12 hours maybe not that you know far off maybe sort of seven to six
hours is a good rule of thumb. Try not to nap essentially late in the
afternoon. And if you do take a nap and you want to maintain your you
don't want to have that grogginess hangover that can happen after a
full night of sleep for the first hour, try to limit it to about 20,
25 minutes. And that way you don't go down into the very deepest
stages of sleep, which if I wrench you out of with an alarm, then you
just kind of feel you almost feel worse, for the first hour after the
nap. I've definitely experienced that if I oversleep. Certainly if the
sun goes down during my nap and I wake up and light overall lighting
conditions have changed, I find it very hard to jolt myself back into
the evening. And it can screw me up. So I try and keep those naps
pretty brief. And I should say, I'm very happy to hear you mention
individual differences and why some people might want to nap and other
people might not want to nap, I have a colleague Liqun Luo he'll be
familiar to many neurobiologist. Yeah of course. Who's a absolutely
spectacular scientist, member of the National Academy, Howard Hughes
investigator just a phenom, and has a ton of energy. But years ago, I
learned that he always takes a nap in the afternoon, so much so that
when he travels to give seminars at other universities, he will tell
his post lunch host whoever it is that he's supposed to meet with, may
I have your office for 30 minutes of our, sometimes 30 minute
discussion or 60 minute discussion, because I like to take a nap. And
he does that and then gives us his, his talks are typically in the
afternoon in academic culture. And he describes the effect of the nap
for him this short naps in the afternoon being so profound for his
productivity. That's actually what inspired me to start feeling okay
about my desire to nap. And so I think for me, that was great
vindication for those that might feel guilty about wanting a nap. But
I take to heart your note about avoiding naps if you have trouble
falling and staying asleep, 'cause I think that I have family members
who also if they nap, they're a wreck, they can't sleep. Yeah, I think
it's just, we've often been very pro sleep with sort of the sleep
community. So I think it's good to always point out these potential
dark sides of any aspect. But you're absolutely right, no one should
feel guilty about getting the sleep that they need. And I think that's
been one of the big problems in society society has stigmatized sleep
with these labels of being slothful or lazy. And we're almost
embarrassed, you know, to tell colleagues that we take a nap. I think
sleep is a write of human beings. And I therefore think that sleep is
a civil right of all human beings. And no one should make you feel
unproud of getting the sleep that you need. No, I love that. And I
it's an important point. I also feel that one of the best ways to beat
your competition in any endeavor is to outlive them. So now that we
know that sleep can enhance longevity and lack of sleep can shorten
one's life, that's all the justification I need anyway. Can somebody
sleep too much? Is it possible to get too much sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=8903"&gt;Is It Possible To Get Too Much Sleep?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a very good question. And there are probably two things to say
about it, there is a condition that we call hypersomnia. But that's a
mixture of things, it's where people have either a very high sleep
need, or they are very sleepy during the day. And they're typically
falling asleep. And these can happen in a variety of different
clinical contexts. One of the places where we've often seen
hypersomnia believed to manifest is in depression. But if you look at
some of those studies, it turns out, it looks more as though those
people are simply reporting being in bed longer, but not necessarily
sleeping longer. And that fits very well with one of the profiles that
we know of depression, which is anhedonia, you don't get pleasure from
normally pleasurable things. So you just don't want to go out into the
world, you don't want to interact because you're depressed. So what do
you do? You just stay in bed? Blinds closed, watching TV, on the
phone. [Matthew] Right, and that just looks as though you know,
Felling miserable. - When people say, what time did you go to bed? And
what time did you get out of bed? The mistake made in that question is
okay, that's how much time their sleeping when you should have said,
what time did you fall asleep? And what time did you wake up? And the
answer could be very different. So that's hypersomnia from a clinical
context. Can you sleep too much though? One of the data points that
argues yes, that's possible is when we look at all cause mortality.
Certainly what you find is that using the sweet spot of seven to nine
hours, when you start to draw below seven hours, there is a
relationship, which suggests that the shorter your sleep, the shorter
your life. Short sleep in that regard predicts all cause mortality.
But it's again, not a linear relationship like the one that we've seen
with REM sleep. Once you get past nine hours, the mortality curve
stops going down. And then once you get further 10 or 11 hours, it
hooks back up again, it's almost like a J shape, tilted over a little
bit and reversed. So there's this strange hook, what's going on here?
Right now, sleep science has at least two non mutually exclusive
explanations for this. The first is that if you look at some of those
populations, the idea is that the whatever was causing them illness
and took their lives was just too much for sleep to deal with.
However, we know that when we get sick, one of the things that we do
immediately in this whole mechanism and inflammatory mechanisms
cytokine mediated, when we get sick, we want to sleep more. We just
want to curl up in bed and you know, sleep it off. So the argument
there is that it's not that sleep was killing people prematurely, it
was that these people were calling on this the help of sleep, they
were calling on this thing called the Swiss Army Knife of health, that
is sleep. But whatever it is that they were facing was just too
powerful for sleep to overcome. So it artificially looks as though
more sleep leads to a higher risk of death, when sleep is actually
responding to the mortality risk, and it lost the battle. That's one
argument. The second is that we know that sleep quality and poor sleep
efficiency is a very strong predictor of all cause mortality. And when
you look at people who often report sleeping longer amounts, 10 or 11
hours, they typically report having very poor quality sleep. So
because their quality of sleep is poor, they just try to sleep longer
to try and get some of that back. So again, here now it's poor quality
sleep masking as too much sleep leading to this artificial hook which
looks like mortality. That's the second explanation. A third which is
more of a Gedanken, which is just the kind of like a thought
experiment and I have this mentality, I don't know how many other
people share this. I actually think that could be a thing as too much
sleep. Physiologically, I think it's possible. But the reason I think
that is because it's no different than food, water or oxygen. Can you
overeat? Yes, you can. Can you under eat? Of course. - Or light. light
in the early part of the day, throughout the day, wonderful. Light
late in the day and at night, detrimental. Bi-directional, you know,
for water, can you over hydrate, hypernatremia it can lead, you know,
it happened in the 1990s and 2000, with the ecstasy craze, where
governments were saying you're dehydrating you're dancing all night,
please drink water. And they drunk too much water, their blood
electrolytes went you know, all over the place, and they were having
cardiac arrests or stroke. Yeah people were dying. And they were dying
because of excessive hydration. Can you get too much oxygen,
hypoxemia? And it can cause free radical damage, which can be
profoundly harmful and kill brain cells. Can you sleep too much? You
know, which is the fifth element of the life equation, you know,
alongside you know, food, water, oxygen, you know, so forth. I should
say I can't even count. Clearly I'm sleeping well. Yes, I think that
could be that possibility. Are most people in danger of getting too
much sleep? Or contrary, if you look at the data. So but I don't
dismiss that idea. I think it's possible. That's a very thorough and
very nuanced, and yet very clear answer. So I, it's so interesting to
think that a lot of the data that's out there that talking about being
in bed too long that it's just trying to compensate for the actual
fragmentation of sleep. So what I'm coming away with is that there are
many paths to this and both positive and things to avoid. But the idea
is to get most nights, a similar amount, probably seven to nine hours,
somewhere in there, of high quality sleep. That this notion of sleep
quality is going to become, I would hope, a phrase that more people
think about and learn about and cultivate as a practice. I want to ask
about a set of behaviors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=9275"&gt;Sex, Orgasm, Masturbation, Oxytocin, Relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that I'm at least I'm aware of at least one company is starting to
track in their sleep monitoring device, and that's orgasm, and sex
orgasm and masturbation topics that are, you know, are somewhat
sensitive. But from the perspective of biology, right, none of us
would be here were it not for sperm meets egg in some fashion, either
in a dish or in vivo. But what are the data as you know them to be or
maybe your lab is even doing this kind of work and exploration about
the role that sex, orgasm, masturbation play in getting to sleep and
staying asleep and sleep quality? Certainly those behaviors and those
physiological events have been part of our evolutionary history.
What's the story there? What can we say about this in terms of science
and dare I say practice? Yeah, I mean, it's almost that caricature of
you know, in the movies where, you know, a couple makes love and then
all of a sudden, you just sort of hear snoring or, you know, that
happens with the idea that it somewhat some neurogenic that it's sleep
promoting. Well, the post orgasmic increase in prolactin. Well, that's
very, is interesting. Is thought to be a set a naturally occurring
sedative, that presumably has a function in. And oxytocin has that
also that benefit where you see, you know, a dissipation of the fight
or flight branch of the nervous system, which has to happen for you to
fall asleep. That's why we often see, you know, here at The Sleep
Center, we'll see a phenomenon called wired and tired where people
say, look, I am so desperately tired I just I'm so so tired, but I
can't fall asleep, because I'm too wired. So your sleep drive, you're
desperately tired, it's there but because you're wired, because you've
got too much sympathetic activation, too much cortisol as well, you
can't fall asleep. It's an impressive roadblock to anything like good
sleep. And it's one of the principal mechanisms that we now believe
stress and physiological activation, that is the underlying cause of
many forms of insomnia. But coming back to sex, the data is actually
quite compelling, that both either subjectively assessed sleep
quality, or objective amount of sleep, sex that has resulted in
orgasm, and I think it's that latter part that typically needs to
happen. I would imagine so. That, you know, so between two mutually
exclusive individuals, where both are, you know, beneficial in terms
of receiving an orgasm. [cross talking] Yeah, I would say any
discussion about sex, we were referring to consensual, age
appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. Wow, I would
never have even gone to the species appropriate. I put species in
there because it's the internet, and people will come up with all
sorts of ideas. So I think that age appropriate, I think age
appropriate, consensual, context appropriate and species appropriate,
covers all the bases, but if I missed any, put them in the comment
section, and we'll be sure to take note. Yeah, no, I think that's
really well said and important to say. So the data that is the when
you look at couples who have orgasm. We've also, however, found
benefits of masturbation, and it's not frequently spoken about. But
what if you do some surveys, it turns out that people will often use
masturbation as a sleep tool, if they're struggling with sleep. And I
know, this sort of sounds almost like a strange conversation, or it's
a taboo conversation but I think we just need to be very open about
all of this. I started off in science, one of the things I worked on
early in my career, not the very first topic was the topic of early
influences of hormones, estrogen and testosterone on sexual
development of the brain and body. And when you are weaned in a
laboratory like that, regardless of what era, you look at sex and its
behaviors, and its hormones, and its physiologies as a scientist, and
so that's to be clear what we're doing here, we're exploring these
behaviors from that perspective. I mean, one thing is for certain,
everyone is here because a sperm met an egg, either in a dish or in
vivo, as we said before, and at least in 2021, there's no way around
that fact. And what preceded that is typically this act we call sex
and sometimes, hopefully, I like to think orgasm is associated with
that sexual activity. Masturbation is one dimension of that is
something that I think it can and should be discussed, if in fact,
there are data that relate it to sleep. Yeah, and both of those routes
seem to lead to a sleep benefit. Now, I'm not saying that it's all
about the orgasm. I think as we spoke about with oxytocin, there is
some degree of par bonding that if you have a partner, and you
experience you know, an intimate loving, you know, relationship that
involves that, then you can have hormonal benefits that are sleep
promoting, that may not necessarily be seen if you're just engaging
you know, in the solo singular act of masturbation. So what we
certainly know and I am not someone to take any advice on when it
comes to anything relationship wise or sex wise. That's a different
episode of the podcast. Yeah, yeah certainly. And that's not a podcast
series that I'm going to be releasing anytime soon, it's going to be
mostly about sleep. Although I will touch on, I'll release a podcast
on sleep and sex. But that's the data that we have so far. We also
know that it works both ways, though. And it's commonly the same way
with sleep. You know, sleep and exercise, sleep and diet. How you eat
can affect how you sleep, how you sleep can affect how you eat. Same
with exercise. And it turns out, it's the same way with sexual
behavior, too. So here, we're talking about whether sex can help with
sleep. Can sleep help with your relationship and sex? And the answer
is, yes, it can. Firstly, we know and we've spoken a little bit about
this, that the reproductive hormones are under profound sleep
regulation. Both estrogen and testosterone, I understand. Estrogen,
testosterone, as I said. Cause we hear so often about testosterone.
But women who, or I should say anyone who's interested in having
higher levels of estrogen or normal healthy levels of estrogen I
presume the data show for estrogen what the data also show, similarly
for testosterone. Which is if you get too little or poor quality of
sleep both sex steroid hormones, as they're referred to testosterone
and estrogen, which are present in both males and females and every
variation thereof, are going to be diminished below normal healthy
levels, correct? Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH in women, a key
hormone in the regulation for, key for conception, of course, all of
these sex hormones seem to become significantly disrupted when sleep
becomes of short quantity, or poor quality. We also know that in
women, sleep disruption can usually lead to menstrual cycle
disruption. We know this, particularly from evidence in shift working
women where they are nighttime shift workers, they struggle with sleep
during the day, often menstruation is disrupted or even becomes
impaired. But we also know it works this way, not just for sex
hormones, but for sex itself. For example, we found that for every one
hour of sleep, extra sleep that a woman gets her interest in becoming
sexually intimate with her partner increases by 14%, which is, you
know, a non trivial amount. - Substantial. And then the final part of
I think this equation when it comes to sleep, and sex is your
relationship itself. And there's some great work here from UC Berkeley
by Professor Serena Chen. And what she found was that restless nights
mean for far more brutal fights in your relationship. And they did
this. - And vice versa. A number of different elegant ways, and vice
versa as well. I mean, not that I've ever had conflict in
relationships. [cross talking] You know, just this is data I've read,
I've never experienced that at all. So, they found reliably that sleep
would predict higher likelihood of relationship conflict. Secondly, if
you got into that conflict, the chances of you resolving it were
significantly lower when the parties had not been sleeping well. Part
of the reason is because when you are not well slept, your empathy
goes down. So you're not, you're taking more of an abrasive stance
with your partner, rather than a more agreeable stance with your
partner. So at almost every dimension of a human loving relationship,
sleep can have a dramatic impact. I think these are really important
things to underscore, one of the most common questions I get, because
there seems to be community of people on the internet that are
obsessed with this. I don't know who they are, because it's all, all
this internet stuff is shouting into a tunnel and getting comments
back in written form. It's a very bizarre conversation, so to speak.
Is whether or not sexual behavior itself lowers or increases
testosterone? And I went into the data, which spans many decades
actually, both animal studies and human studies. And it seems just to
underscore this as long as we're talking about this subject that it
does seem that sexual activity, sex between two people does seem to
increase testosterone in both. There is this question about orgasm or
no orgasm ejaculation, no ejaculation and indeed, there do seem to be
some effects of restricting ejaculation in males as a form of further
increasing testosterone. So sex without ejaculation further increasing
testosterone. But the data are not clean. Presumably because
organizing these sorts of studies and getting truth in self reporting
is probably hard to get from subjects. But everything sort of points
in the direction that provided that the relationship is a healthy one,
it's consensual, it's age appropriate, context appropriate, species
appropriate that sex between two individuals does seem to increase the
sex steroid hormones testosterone and estrogen toward healthy ranges.
And what I'm hearing now this sort of Gestalt of the discussion we
just had is that that too can promote sleepiness, restful states, and
quality sleep. And I think this is an important conversation that just
hasn't been held enough. I mean, sooner or later, both in the US and
elsewhere, we're going to have to acknowledge that we are biological
organisms of some sort, and that we have choice in life, about all
these things, from supplementation to sex, or no sex, et cetera, but
that they have profound effects on our core biology. I mean, it's
fascinating to me that the areas of the hypothalamus, the preoptic
area, the super optic areas, those areas which the names might not
mean anything to anybody, besides Matt and I sitting here, but those
areas sit cheek to jowl with each other in the hypothalamus and
control, sleep and sex. The trigger of orgasm, the appetite for food,
the appetite for water for electrolytes. I mean, the hypothalamus is
kind of a festival of neurons with different booths for different
primitive behaviors. It's such a small, small structure in the brain,
but it's the orchestrator of a vast number of our behaviors
disproportionate in terms of its size versus effect. Yeah, I don't
think you can go to this hypothalamic festival without at least seeing
all the booths whether or not you decide to visit them or not. I love
that master analogy. So I'm glad that we've broached that
conversation. And I hope people will think that we've approached it
with the appropriate level of sensitivity. It's an important one that
we're going to hear more about one way or the other. People are
certainly thinking about this, if not engaging in these sorts of
behaviors or avoiding them. So the more we can understand about the
biology, the better. And so thank you for bringing that topic up.
Because for the record, Matt, tabled it for discussion. We were just
like chatting outside and I think we said something about sort of sex,
and I said we can go there. There is so much interesting data.
Absolutely, I want to touch on just two remaining topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=10050"&gt;Unconventional Yet Powerful Sleep Tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is are there any unconventional sleep tips or things about sleep
that we've overlooked? If we've covered everything great, but you
know, we hear to keep the room cool. We hear because of this
temperature phenomenon, the light aspects, the considerations about
alcohol, CBD marijuana, cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi
perhaps. Please don't put me on the hook for tart cherries and kiwis,
I was just offering what I know about the data. And these are
considerations and whether or not people batch these things, I won't
even list them off now, because they're too many jokes that one could
make. And I have no affiliation with any of these products. [cross
talking] Well, I'm going to take out stock in a kiwi company. No I'm
just kidding. But the question I have is about any unconventional or
lesser known things, or maybe you do things or you think about things
just in a purely exploratory way, as a scientist of that, you know,
the what if kind of things that, yeah, what if it turns out that and I
hear I just, I got a blank there for you to fill in. I think, you
know, beyond the standard, you know, fair that I've dished out plenty
of times of sleep hygiene of you know, regularity, temperature,
darkness, alcohol, caffeine, and we've spoken about all of those. What
are some more unconventional tips, I guess? The first one, which is
unconventional along the lines of naps. If you've had a bad night of
sleep, let's say that you're starting to emerge with insomnia and
you've had a bad night of sleep, the advice and I learned this from my
wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis, do nothing. What I mean by that
is, don't wake up any later, don't sleep in the following day to try
and make up for it, don't nap during the day, don't consume extra
caffeine to wake you up, to try to get you through the day, and don't
go to bed any earlier to think that you're going to compensate. And I
can explain all of those things. But if you wake up later, you're not
going to be sleepy until late in the evening, so you're going to go to
bed at your normal time and you won't be sleeping, you'll think well,
I just came off a bad night of sleep. And now I still, I can't even
get to sleep and it's my normal time. It's because you slept in later
than you would otherwise, and you reduce the window of adenosine
accumulation before your normal bedtime. So don't go, don't wake up
any later. Don't use more caffeine for the reasons that are obvious,
because that's only going to crank you and keep you awake the
following night or decrease the probability of a good following night
of recovery sleep. Third, I mentioned don't take naps, because once
again, that will just take, you know, naps, particularly later in the
afternoon, I almost liken them to snacking before a main meal, it just
takes your appetite off the edge of that main meal of sleep, so don't
do it. And then finally, don't go to bed any earlier, resist and
resist and go to bed at your normal time. What I want to try and do is
prevent you from thinking I had such a bad night last night and I
normally go to bed at 10:30, I'm just going to get into bed at nine
o'clock, because last night was just so bad. But that's not your
natural bedtime, and it's not aligned with your natural chronotype
because presumably you kind of know something about that, our morning
time, evening time, you're trying to sleep in harmony, which is
usually how you get best quality sleep. But you go to bed at nine, and
my body is not ready to sleep at nine o'clock. But I'm worried because
I had a bad night of sleep last night so I get into bed, and now I'm
tossing and turning for the first hour and a half because it's not my
natural sleep window, but I just thought it was a good idea. And if I
didn't know anything about sleep, I would think all of these same
things too. So I'm not finger wagging. But after if I have a bad night
of sleep, and I am not immune, just because I know a little bit about
sleep doesn't mean I don't have my bad nights, I do. Doesn't mean I
haven't had bouts of insomnia in my life, I have. But after a bad
night of sleep, I do nothing. I don't do any of those four things. I
think the second tip I would offer in terms of unconventional is have
a wind down routine. Many of us think of sleep as if it's like a light
switch, that we just jump into bed, and when we turn the light out
sleep should arrive in that same way. Just the binary you know it's on
or it's off. Sleep is a physiological process, it's much more like
landing a plane, it takes time to gradually descend down onto the
terra firma of what we call good solid sleep at night. Find out
whatever works for you and it could be light stretching, I usually
meditate for about 10 or 15 minutes before bed. Some people like
reading, try not to watch television in bed that's usually advised
against. Something that doesn't emit too much light to your eyes. Too
much light, too activating, you know, you can listen to relaxing
podcasts, although we can speak about technology in the bedroom too.
But have some kind of a wind down routine. It's you know, it's almost
like you know, you wouldn't race into your garage and come to a
screeching halt from 60 miles an hour, you typically down, shift your
gears and you slow down as you come into the garage, that's the same
thing with with sleep too. So that's the second thing, have some kind
of a wind down routine, find what works for you. Maybe it's taking a
hot bath or a warm shower, and then stick to it. Just we do this with
kids all the time, we find out what their bedroom, sorry, their
bedtime regiment is and then we just stick to it faithfully 'cause we
humans are the same way too. The third thing is a myth, don't count
sheep. There's a study done here at UC Berkeley, I didn't do this
today, I wish I did, it's by my colleague, Professor Allison Harvey.
And they found that counting sheep actually made it harder to fall
asleep. It made matters worse. As a conter sorry counter measure to
that what they did find was that taking yourself on some kind of a
mental walk, so think about a nice walk that you take in nature or a
walk on the beach, or even a walk around an urban environment. Just
visualizing that. And visualizing that, that seemed to be beneficial.
The other thing about sort of that idea of shifting focus away from
your mind itself, get your mind off itself is a good piece of advice.
Catharsis, you can try to write down all of the concerns that you
have, and do this not right before bed, but usually an hour or two
before bed. Some people call it a worry journal. And to me, it's a
little bit like closing down all of the emotional tabs on my browser.
Because if I shut the computer down and all of those tabs are still
open, I'm going to come back in the morning, and the computer's red
hot the fans going because it didn't go to sleep, because it couldn't
because there were too many tabs active and open. I think it's the
same way with sleep as well, so try to think about doing that. So just
vomit out all of your concerns on the page. I like that, cause my 3am
waking is often associated with me writing down the list of things
that I forgot to do that I need to do. And once I eventually wake up
from the later night, second half of the night's sleep, that stuff
seems much more tractable and reasonable, but it sure would be great
to get that stuff out of the way before sleep. Well, there's also
something that I don't think people have spoken about a lot. And I'd
like to research it, which is difficulty and anxiety at night in the
dark, is not the same difficulty and anxiety in the light of day. And
when we have those thoughts at night, it comes with a magnitude of
rumination and catastrophization that is disproportionate to that
which you would describe when you are awake. And I don't know what's
going on about the brain, and thought and emotion at the time, I've
got a bunch of theories as to why, and that's why I like the idea of
closing up zipping up all of those different components, just get them
out on the page. And it feel, and I at first thought this just sounds
like who its it sounds very Berkeley, it's kind of Kumbaya, we all
hold hands, and, you know, we all come at the end of the day. But then
the data started coming out really good studies from good people. And
they found that keeping one of those journals decreased the time it
takes you to fall asleep by 50%, five, zero. Amazing that's
substantial. - That's well on par with any pharmaceutical agent. I'm
convinced that I've long thought that the worries and concerns and
ideas I have at three, 4am I've learned to not place any stock in
them. Because something, I'm glad that you might decide to eventually
look at this in your laboratory because I feel like something is
melted away or altered. I suspect it's in the regulation of the
autonomic nervous system, that it makes sense why a concern at three,
4am ought to evoke more of a panic sense than a concern sense. And
certainly, that's my experience, although not, fortunate to not suffer
from full blown panic attacks. But everything seems worse at three,
4am provided you're awake. And we need to sort of look into that
because, you know, if you look at suicide rates, around the 24 hour
clock face, disproportionately higher rates in those middle sort of
night hours. So now, I don't know if that's causative or not, but
something you know, it could just be that that's the time when we're
mostly lonely, and we're by ourselves. And that's the reason. So it's
got nothing to do with sleep or the night time, I don't know. So
that's the third thing, I think the fourth sort of little tip I would
give that's unconventional, is remove all clock faces from your
bedroom. Including your phone. Including your phone, and resist
checking it. Now I know and I can speak about the phone too that genie
of technology is out the bottle. And it's not going back in anytime
soon. So we've got to think a scientist and sleep scientist, you know,
as to what we do with you know, phones in the bedroom. Years ago, I
was a counselor at a Summer camp I worked with at risk kids and there
was a phrase that comes to mind here, it's be a channel, not a dam.
Because when you try and dam certain kinds of behavior, physically dam
certain kinds of behavior and not morally dam, that too, it just
creeps over the edge, and you get a waterfall. So it has to be a
channel. The phone and devices have to be worked with and negotiated
not eliminated. That's right and you know, think about those mindfully
too but clock faces, remove all of those, because if you are having,
you know, a tough night, knowing that it's 3:22 in the morning, or
it's 4:48 in the morning, does not help you in the slightest. And it's
only going to make matters worse than better. So try to remove all
clock faces. And I think that's one of those other tips that some
people have found helpful. But those would be sort of some slightly
unconventional, I guess more than your stock fare of here are the five
tips for sleep hygiene tonight, so. Those are terrific sleep tips, and
several of which, if not all of which I'm going to incorporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbQFSMayJxk&amp;amp;t=10750"&gt;Connecting to &amp;amp; Learning More from Dr. Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt, this has been an amazing, deep dive on sleep and it's positive
and negative regulators. I hope it hasn't been too long. No this has
been great. Please cut it down, shorten it to, you know, the five
minutes of meaningful stuff that I offered. Absolutely not, it is
chock a block full of valuable takeaways. It's been tremendously fun
for me to dissect out this incredible aspect of our lives that we call
sleep with a fellow scientist and a fellow public educator. I want to
say several things. First of all, we should say where people can find
you although it shouldn't be that difficult these days. You're a very
present on the internet. [Matthew] Unfortunately. - For better or for
worse. I think it's wonderful that you're out there. Look, it's a
public health service that you're doing. No one requires you or any
other scientist to get out and share this information. My sense of you
knowing you a bit, and from following your work very closely both your
scientific work in detail and your public facing educational work is
that you very much want the best for people. And it's an interesting
thing as a scientist or a clinician, to know that the that certain
answers exist, that we don't have all the answers, but that there is a
better path, there are better ways and people can benefit in a myriad
of ways. So, for that, because I know that to be very genuine in you,
you want the best for people and you're offering tremendous advice and
considerations and people can take it or leave it that's the way I
view it. I also want to thank you for taking the time out of your day
to sit with me here and have this discussion. Not at all, no at all,
it's a privilege, it's a delight, you know, you and I, I think we're
alike kind in lots of ways. And I take you as a shining example of how
you can effectively connect with the public. And I know that we've had
our conversations before we ever sat down to talk together about, you
know, how to think about communicating with the public and the pros
and cons of that. And I've just loved your opinions. I've been
drinking it all in. And then I think the third thing I'd like to say
is, thank you for being such an incredible sleep ambassador, the
series that you've released on sleep, the way that you speak about
sleep, the way that you moderate and have championed sleep. It is
remarkable. So thank you for just being you know, a brother in arms in
that way. But we are and thanks for those those words. 99% of what I
discussed there was the work of you and your colleagues in the sleep
field. So proper acknowledgement, but thank you, where can people
learn more about what you're doing currently? And what's coming next?
You're on Twitter. I am on Twitter I typically tweet. As the sleep
diplomat. So, no it's just sleep diplomat Sleep diplomat on Twitter.
Sleep diplomat on Twitter, sleepdiplomat.com website, if you want to
learn more about the science that we do here, it's
humansleepscience.com. It's the Center for Human Sleep Science. You
can pick up a copy of the book, if you want. It's called "Why We
Sleep?" if you're curious about sleep, that's one path to take and
it's my view. Is there another might someday in the future? I think
there may be, yeah. Great, great, many, many millions of people will
be very happy to hear that. I think it's starting to take hold. And
then as we discussed, I am more than kicking around the idea of a
short form podcast rather than a long form, not long form, because I
don't have the mental capacity or the interviewing, just capability
that someone like you has. So it will probably just be monologue short
form. So if there is some interest, I'll probably do that as well. So
those are the ways that people can find me. But overall, if you're
interested in sleep, just listen to Andrew. That's thing I can tell
people. All right, well now we're bating back and forth the vector of
action so to speak, but I do hope you'll start a podcast however brief
or lengthy these episodes turn out to be because I do believe that's a
great venue to get information out into the world. And we don't just
want to hear more from Matt Walker, I speak for many people, we need
to, the work you're doing is both influential, but more importantly,
it is important work. It has the impact that's needed, especially in
this day and age where science and medicine, public health, and the
issues of the world, etcetera, are really converging. So I know I
speak on behalf of a tremendous number of people, when I just say
thank you for doing the work you do and for being you. - [Matthew]
Thank you. And thanks for being a good friend. Likewise, too and by
the way, I'm just going to note that it was nice that the two of us
both got the Johnny Cash memo about how to dress today. It seems as
though we're both kind of we got that same memo, which will mean
nothing to people who are listening, but if you're watching the video,
you'll probably see what I mean. Andrew, thank you for taking this
time. Thank you so much. Thanks so much Matt. Thank you for joining me

During this episode, and in many previous episodes, we discuss
supplements. One issue in the supplement industry is that many
supplements don't contain what's listed on the bottle. We therefore
have partnered with Thorne, that's T H O R N E, Thorne supplements,
because Thorne supplements have the highest levels of stringency in
terms of the purity of the ingredients, and precision with respect to
what's listed on the bottle is actually what's contained in those
supplement bottles. If you'd like to see the supplements that I take
for sleep, and for other things, you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman
and there you'll see all the supplements that I take and can get 20%
off any of those supplements as well as any other supplements that
Thorne happens to make. That's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman. And
last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. Today, we continue in our discussion about sensation or how
we sense things. On previous episodes, we talked about sensing light
and sound waves for things like vision and hearing. Today, we are
going to talk about our sense of self or what's called interoception.
Interoception is our sensing of our internal landscape, things like
our heartbeat, our breathing, and our gut, how full our gut might
happen to be, or how empty our gut might happen to be. But also our
inner landscape with respect to chemistry, how acidic, or how good or
bad we feel on the inside. This discussion about sense of self and
interoception has many important, actionable items that relate to
bodily health and brain health, and believe it or not, our ability to
perform well or perform poorly in life. Indeed, it has profound
influence on our rates of healing. So today we are going to talk about
all the aspects of our inner landscape and how our brain and body
communicate. And there will be many actionable protocols as we go
along that discussion. Before we begin our discussion about sense of
self, I want to highlight some very recently published research
findings that I believe are immediately actionable and that everybody
should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=85"&gt;Protocol 1: Fermented Foods, Not Fiber, to Reduce Inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are data that were published by my colleague, Justin
Sonnenberg's laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine, and
the data were published in the Journal Cell, which is a very high
stringency cell press journal. So phenomenal data. What this study
showed was that individuals given a high fiber diet actually
experienced less diversity of what's called the gut microbiome. The
number of positive or health promoting bacteria in the gut was
actually reduced by a high fiber diet, whereas individuals that ate
just a couple of servings of fermented food each day, experience
important and beneficial increases in anti-inflammatory markers. And
that could be traced back to improvements in the gut microbiome
diversity, the diversity of bugs, literally little bacteria that live
in the gut, which might sound bad, but they are actually very health
promoting. I'm going to get into all the details of this study later
in the episode, but I just wanted to emphasize these findings because
they are immediately actionable. I think for most people ingesting one
or two servings of fermented food each day is reasonable and does not
bring with it tremendous costs or tremendous inconvenience. And I
think many people are ingesting high fiber diets thinking that that's
the best way to improve their gut microbiome. So while these data may
prove to be controversial among the folks out there in the nutrition
community, that really high fiber diet, I want to just emphasize that
these data were looked at in a very unbiased way. They were done with
large scale screens of all sorts of inflammatory markers. There was no
specific hypothesis going in. It was purely exploratory, but the data
are very clear. It doesn't mean you shouldn't eat fiber doesn't mean
that fiber is bad, but it really shows that eating fermented foods,
just one or two servings a day, and maybe even ramping up to three or
four servings per day can be very beneficial for many aspects of
health. Before we go any further. I'd like to emphasize that this
podcast is separate from my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;teaching and research roles at Stanford, it is however, part of my
desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about
science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping
with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
Our first sponsor is Roka. Rocha makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that
are of the absolutely highest quality. The company was founded by two
All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about their
sunglasses and eyeglasses is developed with performance in mind. I've
spent my career working on the visual system and its various
functionings within the brain and within the eye, Roka sunglasses and
eyeglasses are so phenomenal because they allow the visual system to
do what it does best, which is to adjust to changes in what we call
luminance or brightness, with many sunglasses out there and with many
eyeglasses as well, if the brightness in the room changes or you get
cloud cover, or you walk into a shadow, you have to take the glasses
on or off, you can't see as well. But the folks at Roka really
understand how the visual system works. And so they've designed their
sunglasses and eyeglasses such that you never experienced that shift.
You can walk into a shadow. The amount of sunlight can change. You can
go into a dark room, et cetera, provided there's enough light to see
you're going to see everything crystal clear. In addition you see
everything crystal clear because the lens quality is terrific and the
sunglasses and eyeglasses are very lightweight. So you don't even
notice that they're on your face. Also the sunglasses and eyeglasses
are designed for performance. You can use them while running or while
cycling. Even if you sweat, they won't slip off your face. And as I
mentioned before, they're very lightweight. So everything about these
glasses is terrific and they have a terrific aesthetic. They have a
lot of different styles to select from. And unlike a lot of
performance eyeglasses out there, they won't make you look like a
cyborg. You could wear them to dinner or to somebody's home. And they
look really nice. If you'd like to try Roka glasses, you can go to

Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA to help you better meet your health goals. I'm
a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple
reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-
term health can only be assessed, can only be measured from a quality
blood test. And now with the advent of quality DNA tests, you can get
further insight into the status of your immediate and long term
health. One of the problems with a lot of blood and DNA tests that are
out there, however, is you get the numbers back, you get the levels of
metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera, but you don't get any
information about what to do with those numbers or how to actually
shift them in the direction that you want to. With Inside Tracker,
they have this very easy to use dashboard and that dashboard makes it
very clear, not just what your levels of hormones, et cetera are, but
what actions to take in terms of nutrition or exercise or other
lifestyle factors to bring those numbers into the appropriate ranges
for you. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can go to

Headspace is a meditation app that's backed by 25 peer reviewed
published studies and has over 600,000 five-star reviews. I started
meditating when I was in my teens, but for many years I found it hard
to maintain a meditation practice, I don't think I'm alone with that.
I think many people start meditating. They'll do it for a few weeks or
a few months, or maybe even a year. And then they'll give up the
meditation practice. And we know from so many peer reviewed studies
that meditation has a number of very positive effects on our brain
health, our ability to focus and our bodily health. So it's a great
thing, we probably should all be doing it, but most of us, including
myself, have found it hard to stick to a meditation practice. Then I
started using the Headspace app and what I found is I could be very
consistent with my meditation practice because they have meditations
that are short, meditation that are medium length, and meditations
that are a bit longer, all of which benefit me. The meditations that
they have also are of different styles. You can try different forms of
meditation. I particularly like having a guide for my meditation. It
just helps me stay focused, helps me stay on track and I'm able to
derive all those regular benefits of meditation and keep the practice
up on a regular basis, if you want to try Headspace, you can go to
headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get a one month
totally free trial. And with that, you'll get all of Headspace's
meditations, the full library of meditations. You just go to
headspace.com/special offer, and you get all of their meditations for
one free month and you get to try it, if you don't like it, you can
stop. But I think you will enjoy it. I certainly enjoy meditation and
we know that it's very beneficial for all of us. If you're somebody
who cares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=502"&gt;Main Drivers of Feelings &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about your immediate and long-term health, and if you're somebody
who's interested in performance of any kind in work in relationships,
et cetera, today's topic I believe is among the more important ones
for you. Of all the topics I could cover, this thing that we call
sense of self, which is also called interoception has perhaps the most
foundational level of importance for all that. We feel all that we do
and all that we are capable of doing. In fact I will go so far as to
say that interoception or our ability to sense our inner real estate
is right there next to sleep. And perhaps one other feature of our
health and bodily function that primary early determine how good we
feel in the now in the short term, and in the longterm, and sets the
stage for everything we are capable of doing. And if we don't take
care of this thing that we call interoception, just like if we don't
take care of sleep, we cannot perform well and we will not remain
healthy. Interoception and sense of self are essentially the same
thing, I will use those terms interchangeably, at least for sake of
today's discussion. And I promise that if you can learn a little bit
about the mechanisms of self sensing, of understanding what's going on
in your internal milieu, as we say your internal environment, you will
position yourself to do some very simple things that can lead to
outsize positive effects on everything from sleep to body composition,
to mental focus, to mood, your ability to regulate stress, and indeed
even your ability to heal and recovery from injuries of different
kinds, brain injury and bodily injury. So sense of self is absolutely
crucial. It's sometimes called our sixth sense, right alongside the
other five senses like hearing vision, touch, taste, smell, et cetera,
but sense of self is different. Sense of self is really about what's
going on internally within the confines of our skin. And it involves
two key features that if you can understand those features, and you
understand what modulates or changes, our ability to sense those
features, there are a lot of things that you can do in terms of how
you structure your nutritional practices, how you relate to your
exercise practices, perhaps even certain things that you take in terms
of supplementation that can basically make you feel better, more
alert, and more capable for everything. I don't think that's a
hyperbolic statement, I, in fact, I know it's not a hyperbolic
statement because we have a system in our body that connects our brain
to all of our bodily organs and connects all of those bodily organs to
our brain. And that communication between brain and body in both
directions creates a situation where either we are positioned to do
things well, or we are positioned to do things poorly. So I really
want to dive in and dissect, what is this system of brain, body
communication? What does it look like? What are the actual neurons and
connections? And as I do that, I promise that I'm going to place
protocols, tools that you can apply in order to make sure that those
neurons and connections are working optimally. So let's begin by
talking about what system communicates the brain to the body and the
body back to the brain. The system that's most often associated with
this is our 10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=705"&gt;Brain-Body: A Mechanical &amp;amp; Chemical Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word vagus relates to the word vagabond, which to wander, and
indeed the vagus nerve is a vast, enormous wandering set of nerves, so
it's not one nerve. It's not like one fiber, one axon. As we say in
the nervous system, we have these wires, we call axons that let
neurons communicate. It's a bunch of neurons and a bunch of wires that
go everywhere, so where do they go? Well they leave the brain, and the
brain stem, the brain stem is kind of the back of your brain. If you
touch the back of your neck, it's about three inches deep to where
you're touching. The neurons that are there send information into the
body to control your bodily organs, how fast your heart is, beating
how fast you're breathing, how fast your digestion is occurring. Even
things like whether or not you are going to secrete so-called killer
cells, your immune cells from your spleen to go ward off bacteria. Now
the neurons there don't know what to do unless they receive
information about what's going on within the body and within the body,
your heart, your lungs, your diaphragm, your gut, so everything from
your intestines to your stomach, et cetera, and your spleen or sending
information also up to the brain. So as I mentioned before, it's a
two-way street. So the vagus nerve is a very important nerve, but just
by saying vagus nerve, it sounds like a singular. It sounds like one
thing, but actually what we're talking about is a series of super
highways, it's like Google maps, it's got stuff going everywhere with
alternate routes, communicating back and forth. There are two
fundamental features of what's going on in your body that need to be
communicated to your brain, these neurons in your brain stem in order
for your brain and your body to work together correctly. And the two
types of information are mechanical information. So things like
pressure, things like lack of pressure and chemical information,
whether or not your gut is acidic or whether or not it's not acidic,
whether or not you have some sort of pathogen, you know, something
that you ate or that got into your body somehow and is making you sick
or whether or not you don't have a pathogen in your body. So you've
got mechanical sensing and chemical sensing. So when you think about
your sense of self and your ability to understand what's going on in
your body, if you feel good, or if you feel bad, your sense of self is
dependent on these mechanical phenomenon and these chemical
phenomenon. And for every organ in your body, whether or not that's
your heart or your lungs or your spleen, both the mechanical
information about that organ for instance, is if your gut is full or
empty, whether or not your heart is beating fast or beating slowly,
that's mechanical, and chemical information, whether or not your gut
feels nice, and whether, you know, when I say nice, I mean, whether or
not it has a balance of acidity and alkalinity, that feels right to
you or whether or not your gut feels off, it doesn't feel quite right.
That's chemical information. If you are not getting enough oxygen and
levels of carbon dioxide and other gas go up too high. So your lungs
can register that and that chemical information is sent to your brain.
And then your brain does certain things actually really encourages you
to do certain things in order to adjust that chemistry. So the first
principle that everyone should understand about their sense of self is
that they are sensing mechanical and chemical information about every
organ in their body, except for one, and that's the brain. Your brain
actually doesn't have pain receptors. It doesn't even have touch
receptors. The brain is a command center. It helps drive and govern
changes in the organs of the body. But your brain doesn't move, at
least not much. It can move a little bit fluid moves within it. But as
long as you're healthy, it's not moving that much. Your brain has no
sensation of its own, in fact, when they do brain surgery on people,
they will the size or put some anesthesia on the scalp. They'll cut
away the skin there so that people don't feel anything. They'll use
some anesthesia they'll peel back the skin and then they'll use a,
let's call it what it is, it's a bone saw. And they basically saw open
a little window in the skull. I've actually done this before and seen
this before. I've done this many times before, and once you're inside
the brain, you can put electrodes in there and you can put various
things in there, of course, all for therapeutic purposes. And you do
that without any anesthesia to the actual brain tissue, because it has
no receptors to sense anything. It doesn't have pain receptors. It
doesn't have pressure receptors. None of that, when you have a
headache in your head, feels like it's too much pressure, well that's
because of here's that lie outside the brain. So your organs are
different. They need to tell your brain what's going on. And there are
ways that you can control the mechanical and the chemical state of
your organs in ways that are very powerful, and this is crucial to do,
because if you can properly regulate the mechanical and chemical
environment of your body, your brain functions better. This is
absolutely clear from data that if your gut is healthy, if you get the
alkalinity right, the acidity, right, and if your spleen is healthy
and happy, and if your lungs are working properly, not just breathing
and pumping in and out air, but you're breathing at the right cadence
for a particular activity, then your brain will function better. So
let's talk about how you can adjust the mechanical and chemical
environment of your organs in order to make your brain better and how
your brain can make the mechanical and chemical environment within
your organs function better. For instance we're going to talk about
how you can change the chemistry of your gut in order for your brain
to be able to focus better, think better, remember better and sleep
better. And we're going to talk about how you can change the chemistry
of other organs in your body, such that your immune system will
function better than it would otherwise. And you can actually heal
faster from small cuts and bruises, but also injuries of any kind,
even major injuries. So as I mentioned before, we've got these organs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=1070"&gt;LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm, and I'll explain what that is,
the gut and the spleen. And the spleen is this immune organ. Let's
take one example of these and explain how mechanical and chemical
information from this particular set of organs communicates to the
brain and how that changes how our brain works. And the organ I'd like
to focus on first are the lungs and the diaphragm. So we're all
familiar with our lungs, these two big bags of air, but they're
actually not two big bags of air. They actually have little tiny sacs
within them, actually millions of little sacs called the alveoli of
the lungs. The alveoli of the lungs are like little tiny balloons
throughout our lungs, and the more of those balloons, we have, the
more air that we can actually contain. So we are not too big bags of
air in there, our lungs, we actually have millions and millions of
little tiny bags of air within those lungs. Those little bags of air
can fill up or they can deflate, right, just like your lungs overall
can fill up or they can deflate. The diaphragm is a muscle, it's kind
of shaped like a dome. So it's kind of a, you know, think about a
basketball or a soccer ball that has most of the air pushed out of it.
And so it's kind of crescent shape or dome shaped, and it sits below
our lungs and the way the diaphragm and the lungs work together is
very interesting. The diaphragm is actually skeletal muscles. So it's
just like a bicep or a quadricep. And the fact that it is skeletal
muscle is important because it has a unique property, which is that
you can control it voluntarily. You can decide to take control of your
diaphragm by just consciously deciding you want to breathe in a
particular way, just like you can take conscious control over your
legs. They will work just fine, if you're not thinking about them, as
you walk as provide, you already know how to walk, but at any moment,
you can decide to change the rate of your walking, your so-called
cadence of walking. So the diaphragm as a skeletal muscle also has
that property, the diaphragm moves up and down, depending on how you
breathe, or rather, I should say how the diaphragm moves up and down
determines how you breathe. How you breathe is also dependent on
little muscles that are between your ribs, the intercostals and other
muscles, if you're a martial arts fan that Bruce Lee was famous for
having these very pronounced intercostals from doing all sorts of, you
know, bridging exercise, et cetera. But those are the muscles. And we
all have them, even if some of us, most of us don't have, intercostals
like Bruce Lee. So when you breathe a couple things happen, but let's
talk about the mechanical things first. And then let's talk about how
those mechanical steps relate back to the brain and what that does for
the brain. And I can promise you that if you develop an awareness of
these mechanical changes, you do not have to go through extensive
breathwork practice or do extensive breathwork. You will immediately
believe it or not develop a sense of your breathing self of your lungs
and diaphragm. It takes no practice, but once you do it, you will
forever be changed in terms of your awareness of your breathing and
your ability to leverage your breathing. Kind of like the steering
wheel on a car in order to shift your brain in the direction that you
want to go. So it's a very powerful system. And the way it works is
the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=1260"&gt;Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate With Breathing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this will also incorporate the heart, so, and by the heart, I
don't mean it in the emotional sense. Although we don't rule out
emotions here at the Huberman Lab podcast, we like emotions, but I'm
talking about the heart as an organ, as a beating organ, that
circulates blood. So when we inhale, these little sacs in our lungs
fill up and our lungs expand. And when we do that, we take up space in
our thoracic cavity and our diaphragm moves down, okay. When we
exhale, the diaphragm moves up, the lungs get smaller, okay? So
inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. This
actually controls our heart rate, but it does it by changing the way
that our brain works. And it works in the following way. So when we
inhale, our lungs fill our diaphragm moves down. Our heart actually
has a little more space because the diaphragm's moved down. So the
heart gets a little bit bigger, physically bigger, not in the
emotional sense, but physically bigger. And as a consequence, whatever
blood is in the heart flows at a slower rate because it's a larger
volume, so bigger volume heart, same amount of blood inside the heart
means slower flow. Okay, sort of like expanding a pipe. The brain
registers that because there are a set of neurons in the heart called
the sinoatrial node. It sends that information to the brain. That
information is registered by the brain and the brain sends a message
back to the heart to speed the heart up. So every time you inhale
because of these mechanical changes in the diaphragm and lungs, and
because of the mechanical changes in the heart, your brain sends a
signal to the heart to speed the heart up, so if you do long inhales
or you inhale more vigorously, you actually are speeding your heart
up. Now, of course you have to exhale as well. But for instance, if I
were to inhale very long like [inhales heavily] the entire time my
heart rate is increasing. And then if I did a quick exhale, [exhales
quickly] something else will happen, but if I kept doing that,
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly] my heart rate would increase. It's
not going to increase linearly and forever, but it will increase with
each inhale. Or I can simply make my inhales more vigorous. [inhales
quickly] And my heart rate will speed up. This is an autonomic and
automatic relationship between the diaphragm, the lungs, the brain,
and the heart. Now, if inhale speed the heart up, what happens on
exhales? When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up. It's a little
counterintuitive, but you can kind of think about it as like pushing
the plunge on a syringe, right? When you exhale, this thing moves up
and as the diaphragm moves up, the heart has less space. Meaning it
gets a little bit smaller, which means that whatever volume of blood
is inside the heart moves faster, through that smaller volume, that
information is sent to the brain via these collection of neurons
called the sinoatrial node for you aficionados. The brain then sends
information via the vagus nerve back to the heart, to slow the heart
down. So while inhales speed up the heart, that's the net effect
exhales, slow the heart down. And the reason they slow the heart down
is because of a register in the change in mechanical pressure between
the diaphragm, the lungs and the heart. So this is to me, the simplest
and most straightforward example of how the brain is changing the way
our organs work, our heart in this case, according to changes in
mechanical interoception. Now, we're not always aware of this, some of
us are aware of it, some of us aren't. If you do it right now, you
will be aware of it, so you can try this. You can basically, this is
an experiment or an example in interoception, in sensing one's self.
So if you inhale, doesn't matter how long you inhale. I'll do it for a
couple seconds [inhales quickly] and then exhale twice as long.
[exhales slowly] Nose or mouth, doesn't matter, the entire time that
you're exhaling, you're slowing your heart down. So just as a car has
an accelerator and a brake, or you can slow a car by coming off the
accelerator. When you exhale, you're effectively coming off the
accelerator, or if you want to think about it differently, you're
hitting the brake, you're slowing down your heart rate. Now, normally
your heart rate stays in more or less the same range for a given
activity because you're inhaling and exhaling. But this is just a
simple way of showing that mechanical changes in your viscera can
change the way that your brain works and then your brain changes the
way that those viscera work. And it's a very concrete agreement, it's
like a contract between the organs of your body and the brain. In
fact, you can think about this contract in more detail, and you can
leverage this in a very powerful way to set the conditions of your
mind. If you want to be more calm, emphasize exhales, and the simplest
way to do this. I've talked about this many times before, but if you
haven't heard me say it, this will become immediately clear is to
emphasize exhales through what's called a physiological sigh. Two
inhales, could be through the nose of the mouth, but ideally through
the nose, so [inhales quickly twice] so followed by a long exhale.
[exhales slowly] Those double inhales are kind of important because
what they do is they maximally fill all those little sacs in your
lungs, and then when you breathe out, you're exhaling as much of the
so-called carbon dioxide in your system as possible. We'll talk about
carbon oxide in a second. So the fastest way to calm down is to
emphasize exhales. When you make exhales longer, you're slowing your
heart rate, you're calming down. You don't need any sophisticated
training. You don't have to do this for minutes on end. You don't have
to do anything. You don't even have to call it breathwork. It's just
respiration, and in fact, you do this every night. When you go to
sleep and carbon dioxide builds up too much in your bloodstream, or if
you hold your breath or something, or you watch an animal or a small
child that sleeping, they will occasionally do these double inhale
long exhales it's way of slowing the heart down and eliminating carbon
oxide. The opposite is also true. If you inhale deeply or vigorously
and then exhale less long or less vigorously, you will increase your
level of alertness through these purely mechanical aspects of your
interoception. So for instance, if I were to take a big deep inhale
[inhales deeply] and then a short exhale, [exhales quickly] and then
another one, a big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale, [exhales
quickly] It only takes two or three of those before you start to feel
more alert. And that's because your heart rate is increasing. And
actually if you keep doing that for 25 or 30 breaths of inhale deep
short exhale, you will start to secrete a lot of adrenaline. This
hormone that comes from your kidneys and from your brainstem make you
feel really alert. You will actually feel as if you've had a cup of
espresso. So you will immediately wake up. And there's an intermediate
form of breathing, which is sometimes called box breathing, but it's
really equal inhale and exhale duration. And these, it basically goes
like this. You're you're going to inhale, so do this for maybe two,
three seconds inhale, [inhales] then hold, okay, two, three seconds.
Then exhale, two, three seconds. Then hold two, three seconds. Most
often people forget to hold. So it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold for
equal or more or less equal durations, could be one second, could be
two seconds, could be three seconds. Most people find that when you
get out past five seconds, they start to struggle to maintain the so-
called box breathing. And most people can't consciously box breathe
for too terribly long without having to think about it. But the point
here is that through purely mechanical means changing the way that you
breathe, emphasizing inhales or exhales, or keeping them the same will
change the way that your brain works, how alert you are and how well
you function in anything. And again, this doesn't mean that breathwork
has no value. It's just simply to say that long extended protocols of
breathwork are simply, they are truly simply just an exploration of
this fundamental relationship between the mechanics of your internal
organs and your brain and how your brain controls those internal
organs. Now you might ask, well, how is this pressure known?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=1748"&gt;Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the body actually know how full the lungs are, now? This is
an answer that's more for the aficionados out there, but I've had a
few requests, or I should say thousands of requests for more in-depth
science, so if you're not interested more in depth science, just this
will allow you to tune out now for maybe just 10 seconds, and if you
are interested, pay careful attention, there is a set of receptors
which are called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo
means pressure. And these were discovered a few years ago by a couple
of different laboratories, but one of the main ones, one of the main
laboratories that discovered these piezo receptors is the laboratory
of Ardem Patapoutian. I love saying his name, even though I'm probably
pronouncing it, he's a friend and a former colleague when my lab was
down in San Diego, he's at the Scripps Institute, he's a Howard Hughes
Medical Institute investigator, which basically means that he's a
total stud of science and has made many important discoveries. The
piezo receptors line many tissues, and inform the brain about pressure
in those tissues. But the lungs have a particular category of piezo
receptors called piezo two receptors. And as you fill your lungs and
these little sacs of air, the alveoli fill, the piezo two receptors
because of the way they react to that filling send information by way
of a bunch of neurons, a bunch of wires up to the brain and tell you
how full your lungs are, so that's the kind of mechanistic detail. If
you want to learn more about that, you can look up our Ardem's lab at
the Scripps and the beautiful work that they and other laboratories
are doing on piezos, piezos are pretty cool. I think I also just like
saying piezo, so that's why I brought that up as well. So mechanical
sensing of the lungs, heart and diaphragm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=1854"&gt;Carbon Dioxide, From Air to Blood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now let's talk about chemical sensing because there's carbon
dioxide and there's oxygen. And this is really simple. You have oxygen
and carbon dioxide and you need them both. I sometimes hear people
talk about carbon dioxide is this bad thing and oxygen, it has a good
thing. You need them both, and you need them in the appropriate
balance. You have a collection of neurons in your brain that register
when carbon dioxide levels get to a certain point in your bloodstream.
When that point, that threshold is reached, these neurons fire, and
they cause you to breathe sometimes called the gasp reflex, it just
makes you want to inhale. And as a consequence, you bring in more
oxygen. Okay, so we don't really breathe to get oxygen. That's a by-
product of inhaling to eliminate carbon dioxide. You don't want carbon
dioxide levels to go too high. In fact, if you want to freak somebody
out and we do these in experiments, and I don't recommend you do this,
you just increase the levels of carbon dioxide that they inhale, and
the brain will go into an almost immediate panic response because the
health of all our tissues depends on keeping a nice balance between
carbon dioxide and oxygen. You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go
too high. So the impulse to breathe, if you're under water, or if you
hold your breath is triggered by these neurons and the triggering of
those neurons comes from elevated carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.
And for those of you that don't quite know how to conceptualize the
relationship between bloodstream and breath, I do think it's
important. And maybe you remember this from high school biology, but
if you don't, I'll make it clear for you now, it's very easy. You
inhale air and that air and the oxygen molecules in that air actually
move from your lungs into the bloodstream because these little alveoli
of the lungs, those little sacs of air are in there, they basically
have a lot of little micro vessels and capillaries, little tiny,
basically blood vessels, essentially, although they're mostly
capillaries, micro capillaries are the little tiny ones, that line
them, so there's actually an interface and opportunity for air and
molecules within the air to pass into the blood and then they move in
your bloodstream, and when you exhale, the opposite is true. So you
can move things from the air, into your bloodstream or from your
bloodstream into the air by way of the lungs, and there's a lot more
detail to it. And I'm sure those of you that are experts out there. If
you want to put some stuff in the comments, maybe a little bit of a
kind of intermediate tutorial, you might even entitle it, intermediate
tutorial. If you know a lot about this, just I'll check it, but make
sure you get the details, right. Make sure you know the process. And I
find that for people that are interested in understanding how
breathing really works, it's really nice to think about the
relationship between the heart and the vascular system, the blood and
the air system, the respiration system, and breathing, because those
two things are very, we say, they're interdigitated, they're
interwoven with one another. So how does this work, well, carbon
dioxide is too high, you breathe in, you inspire, you, inhale you off
as a consequence, when you exhale, you offload carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=2042"&gt;Protocol 5: Alert While Calm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a really cool way that you can explore this chemistry of your
breathing and your bloodstream and the way that your brain works in
ways that can really benefit your health. And it works the following
way. You want to essentially sit or lie down. It doesn't really
matter. You definitely don't want to be anywhere near water, not a
bathtub, not a hot tub, not a, you know, not a cold dunk or something.
In fact, don't even be in a puddle. And what you want to do in this
case is you're going to breathe in deep. So that's going to increase
your heart rate and then exhale passively by just letting air fall out
of your mouth. So it will look something like this. [inhales
vigorously, exhales passively] So it's you breathe in vigorously and
then you let the air just fall out of your mouth. When you do that,
what you're essentially doing is you're bringing in a lot of oxygen
through that deep breath. And you're exhaling a little bit of that
carbon dioxide. But if you were to repeat it 25 times, maybe 30 times,
it doesn't matter if it's 25 or 30, somewhere in there, you would
essentially start bringing in a lot of oxygen and blowing off or
exhaling a lot of carbon dioxide. So you're actually going to change
the chemistry of your internal landscape, and you can then sense it.
You can interocept what that is like. And there are some really
interesting reasons for wanting to do that, so I'm not going to do all
25 or 30 now, maybe do five or 10, so you can get a sense of what it
looks like, so that it's clear. I'm going to essentially demonstrate
now, so it's inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale through the
mouth,[exhales] I am inhaling the nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times] So it's essentially, excuse me, a two second
or so inhale and then a one second or so exhale, and as I was doing
that, I can kind of feel my face get flush and my body is heating up
and my brain is heating up, what's happening there? Well that pattern
of breathing is increasing levels of adrenaline in my brain and body,
and I'm getting more alert. Then after 25 or 30 of those, you exhale
all your air. [exhales deeply] You dump all your air. You can do that,
your nose or your mouth. And then you hold your breath with your lungs
empty for about 15 to 30 seconds. Now, for those of you that want to
explore this, and please be careful as you explore this, don't do
anything stupid, like do this while you're driving or something like
that. You can exhale all your air and what you'll find then is you can
hold your breath for a very long time. And the reason you can do that
is because you've blown off all the carbon dioxide or most of the
carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. So you shifted the chemistry of
your blood by breathing in a particular way. And by doing that, you
are no longer triggering these neurons that cause the gasp reflex or
the reflex to breathe. Now, of course you have to breathe sooner or
later but what you'll find is if normally your ability to hold your
breath is a minute or so before you really feel that gasp reflex kick
in, you might find that you can go 90 seconds or two minutes. And with
some practice, people find that they can start holding their breath
for three or four minutes or longer. This is actually how free divers
do what they do. I do not want anyone free diving. If you're going to
learn free diving, please learn it from an expert. Many people die
trying to teach themselves out of free dive or trying to teach their
friends at a free dive when they don't know what they're doing. This
is not what this is about, don't again, don't do this anywhere near
water, but it is a very interesting exploration of how you can shift
the chemistry of your bloodstream by modulating your air by modulating
the mechanics of your diaphragm and lungs and thereby shift the way
your mind works, your brain. And in fact, what you'll notice is that
even though during that 25 or 30 breaths, [inhales and exhales
quickly] you'll feel very alert, when you exhale all your air and
you're in the breath hold, you will feel very alert, but very calm.
Now this is interesting because it's a state that we all sort of want
to achieve alert, but calm, but have a hard time achieving. And so for
those of you that have a hard time obtaining focus for sake of work or
focus for sake of anything I should say, and when you are able to
achieve focus, it's through the use of things like stimulants, or you
feel like you have to have a cold shower or ice bath, or you have to
have four espresso in order to be alert, but then you're too alert,
you're jittery. You can't focus. This pattern of breathing can lend
itself very well to entering states of alert, but calm for the fall,
the 10 or even 20 minutes that follow that breathing. And then you
could repeat it if you want. So it's a very useful practice to
explore. Some of you may be familiar with this practice and so-called
Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof is a practitioner of what's called Tumo
breathing. Tumo breathing has been around for centuries. And for those
of you that are familiar with breathwork and yoga practices, I
acknowledged that nothing I just described is new based on science,
however, the science informs why those practices work. And just as a
little mini editorial, I just want to emphasize as well. That one
thing that this podcast is really about is trying to remove fancy
nomenclature, whether or not it's yogic nomenclature or scientific
nomenclature so that people can access protocols. Because the moment
we start naming things after people or calling them Tumo et cetera, I
have no problem with that, but it doesn't inform how the practices are
done, nor does it inform the underlying mechanisms. So here I'm trying
to teach you the mechanisms. And as a final point to that, the most
powerful form of breathing is the one that takes into account the
fundamental mechanisms that in increase heart rate, that exhales
decrease heart rate, and that carbon dioxide and oxygen relate to the
bloodstream and the brain in particular ways, once you understand
those components, then you can create your own so-called breathwork
practices. You can breathe in the ways that best serve you, as opposed
to thinking that one protocol is the best or holy protocol for
everything, because it's simply not. As a final final point, I want to
say that as you shift the way that you breathe, whether or not you're
showing off more carbon dioxide or bringing in more oxygen, you are
fundamentally changing the chemistry of your internal milieu have your
body, and that has been shown to have important effects on the way
that your immune system functions and the way that you deal with
inflammation and all sorts of different sort of things that can enter
your body and cause problems or conditions of stress, et cetera. So I
will explore that further as the episode goes on, but I want to move
on to just touch on one other aspect of reading, that's purely
mechanical, which I think is very interesting and important, which
relates to a particular reflex that you're going to be very familiar
with in a second. And that can serve you very well in times of extreme
stress. The reflex I'm referring to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=2450"&gt;Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is something called the Hering Breuer Reflex. I'm not going to go into
details about how the Hering Breuer reflex works, but it has to do
with particular classes of neurons and cells that are called a
Baroreceptors. Those are basically pressure receptors, they sense
pressure. And basically what the Hering Breuer reflex is about is that
when your lung is inflated, your desire to breathe is reduced. So you
can try that right now, you can inhale [inhales] huge big thing of
air. And hold, okay? Your desire to breathe will kick in later than
were are you to exhale all your air and hold your breath. When you
exhale all your air and your breath, unless you've done the sort of
protocol I described a few minutes ago of doing a bunch of inhales and
exhales first in a very deliberate way, you will feel empty. Those
Baroreceptors are going to be firing like crazy saying, there's no
pressure in here, there's no pressure here, I got nothing in here. You
need to breathe, you need to breathe in, the gasp reflex will kick in
sooner. You can apply that in all sorts of situations related to
exercise, related to modulating stress, et cetera. So the Hering
Breuer reflex is a very powerful one. This is why you take a big deep
breath before you go under water. [inhales heavily] All right, you're
not going to exhale all your air and go under water. If you were to
exhale all your air and go under water, you would absolutely feel the
need to come up sooner for a breath of air than had you a full tank,
so to speak a full of lungs full of air. And this is also the way that
people teach themselves to feel comfortable under water. So when you
learn how to swim, you learn how to swim both by having air in your
lungs while you're underwater and no air in your lungs while you're
underwater. In any event the Hering Breuer reflex is yet another
dimension to the way that mechanical pressure influences your brain's
decision-making, about what to do with your body, in this case,
whether or not to breathe. So now I want to shift away from breathing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=2567"&gt;Gut Volume &amp;amp; The Desire to Open Your Mouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and diaphragm and lungs and move toward another organ within our
viscera, which is our gut. So this includes our stomach and our
intestines, our esophagus and so forth. It's been said before, both by
me and by others that we are, but a series of tubes, and indeed that's
true. Believe it or not, every system in your body is a tube. Your
brain is actually a tube that connects your spinal cord, which has
also a tube. You started off as a tube, you were like a churro. You
know, those churros I don't know if you're not familiar with churros,
they're like donuts that are shaped like a tube. That's essentially
what you look like early in development, not long after conception and
the front end of that churro grew and grew and grew, but you always
maintained a hollow through that tube. That's why you have what are
called ventricles, gaps or a space in your brain and spinal cord that
run the length of your brain and spinal cord and fluid, cerebral
spinal fluid, and other things move through that space. We're going to
return to the ventricles later, they are very important. They're just
space filled with fluid, but they do a lot. Similarly your digestive
system starts with the tube at your mouth and of course goes down
through your throat. And then you've got all the elements of the
stomach and the intestines, and then it comes out the other end. So
you are, but a series of different tubes, your vascular system, a
series of other tubes. So you're tubes. The way your digestive system
works is to communicate to your brain about the status of the
mechanical pressures along this tube, so within your stomach and your
intestines, et cetera, and the chemical status of that tube at various
portions within that tube to inform your brain about how your brain
should control that tube. So let's start with the mechanical sensing
of your gut. If you drink a lot of fluid, or if you eat a lot of food,
your gut will fill up, your stomach will fill up with food. Now it
gets digested there. It gets digested elsewhere along your digestive
track too, of course but it starts getting digested there because
along this tube, you have a series of what are called sphincters,
which basically are like little draw pulls. Have you ever had a
laundry bag, which has a drawstring on it? You pull it and then it
cinches shut, and then you can open it again, that's what those are.
Those are sphincter openings and you have them in your throat, you
have them along your digestive tract, all the way to the end. Food
will enter your gut. And if there's a lot of that food, pressure
receptors, some of which are these piezo receptors will communicate to
the areas of your brain that are involved in feeding, and we'll say,
don't eat anymore. You don't need to consume anymore, now, some people
bypass that these, I guess they have these like hotdog eating
competitions. I'm always struck by how some of those people are like,
seem to be rail thin, but they actually train for those competitions
by ingesting large volumes of water, actually a very dangerous
practice. You can actually kill yourself by drinking too much water,
and you can kill yourself by ingesting too much of anything, really to
expand your gut, not a good practice, not a big fan of those
competitions. But even if you're one of those people or you're the
world heavyweight champion of them, they are informative toward what
I'm talking about now, which is that as you expand the gut, a signal
is sent by neurons, literally nerve cells that are in the gut to the
brain, stem up to the areas of the brain that are involved in feeding,
I did a whole episode on feeding. You can find on "Feeding, Metabolism
And Hunger." You're welcome to listen to that episode, if you like,
and we'll shut down the neurons that drive the desire to put more
stuff in your mouth. That thing that people say sometimes on well in
this country frequently after Thanksgiving meal, I can't put another
bite in my mouth. Literally they shut down some of the basic movements
of the musculature to take another fork bite. I know it sounds crazy,
but they can actually control your brain. So your gut is so full that
it's controlling your brains, such that this action of spooning food
towards your mouth is actually inhibited. It's made more difficult or
less likely to occur. It's incredible. The converse is also true, when
these piezo receptors signal to the brain, that the gut is empty
independent of your need, your actual need for food. There's a signal
that sent to your brain that says gut is empty and neurons get
stimulated in areas like the arcuate nucleus and these areas of the
hypothalamus and et cetera, that drive the desire to make this action,
to open the mouth and to put stuff in it in particular food. So when
you find yourself at the refrigerator or you find yourself almost, you
know, manically trying to get food of different cons, you're not even
thinking about what you're eating, because you're so hungry, in part
that's because the lack of food in your gut has sent that information
to your brain and is driving particular fixed action patterns that are
associated with eating, in fact, one of the first things children
learn how to do is open their mouth when something is presented to it.
And then they learn how to move a spoon or a fork. They're not very
good at it, at first, they get all over the place, but eventually they
get good at, or at least most people get good at if you watch how
people eat, you know, it's kind of very variable out there. In any
event, this is a purely mechanical phenomenon. And this purely
mechanical phenomenon is driving our brain to drive certain behavior.
You can get better at registering sense of fullness or lack of
fullness in a very particular way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=2898"&gt;Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have a very keen sense of how full or empty their stomach
is, so if you've eaten anything, even if it's a small volume of food
in the last hour to three hours, it's actually a worthwhile practice
to take a few moments, maybe 10, 20 seconds, and actually just try and
concentrate on sensing the neurons in your gut and how full you are,
like for instance, I ate a few hours ago and then I had a little snack
about 30 minutes ago or so. And my gut feels neither terribly full nor
terribly empty. It's kind of, I would put it kind of like 30, 40%
okay. So by just taking conscious awareness of how full or empty our
gut is at various times between meals, after a meal, before a meal,
you can very quickly develop a sense of how full or empty you are.
Now, what's the consequence of that? The consequence of that is
actually rather interesting. It's been shown that the consequence of
that is actually that you can better override the signals of these
piezo receptors and gut fullness or emptiness. So for those of you
that find that you eat kind of compulsively or non-consciously, or
subconsciously, I should say, probably have to be conscious enough to
be awake to eat, but subconsciously you just find yourself eating and
here I'm describing myself, I'm like, I'm a drive by blueberry eater.
If there's a bowl of blueberries, every time I walk past it, I sort of
have to grab a handful of them and pop them in my mouth, but if you
develop this sense of how much mecho-pressure, it's not really word,
but how much mechano-sensation is in your gut, very quickly, you can
learn to override that. You might ask, why would I want to be able to
override whether or not my stomach is empty or my stomach is full?
Well, there are many reasons to want to do that. Many people right now
are interested in so-called intermittent fasting. They're doing fast
of anywhere from 12 to 16 hours, every 24 hour cycle, that's actually
what my practice is. I do that on a regular basis, sometimes the, I
eat breakfast, but normally I pushed breakfast out to about 11 or
noon, or sometimes a little later, some people are doing longer fast,
and there are really wonderful data publishing excellent journals from
my colleagues Satchin Panda at the Salk Institute Of Biological
Studies. And of course from other laboratories showing that
intermittent fasting can and will have some positive health effects on
things like liver health and brain health and other aspects of health.
Whether or not it's the best form of dieting for the sake of losing
weight, that's very controversial, but it's clear that having a period
of fasting every 24 hours or perhaps even longer from time to time can
be beneficial because it stimulates what's called autophagy, the
clearing away, or the body's ability to eat certain dead cells, so
called senescent cells, and for many people, they struggle with
fasting because they feel they have a very keen sense of their stomach
being empty. And they feel as if they have to eat. And in a kind of
counter-intuitive way, there's some data that indicate that being able
to sense whether or not your gut is full or empty, and just the
knowledge that that's communicating information to your brain about
whether to not to eat or not just that awareness, that understanding
allows them to override the signal. They think, oh, you know, I'm not
actually in need of nutrients right now. It's just that my stomach is
empty. And these piezo receptors, and some other ones that I'll tell
you about in a moment are signaling to my brain that it's empty. I
don't actually need food, it's just, it's just that my brain is
reacting to the fact that my gut is deflated, so to speak or a
smaller, doesn't have food in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=3110"&gt;Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids &amp;amp; Sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are other ways that our guts communicate with our brain, it's
not just our stomach talking to our brain. It's also our intestines
talk to our brain. The Liberles Lab the guy's name is Steven Liberles,
he runs a lab at Harvard Medical School, it's a terrific lab, does
excellent work on gut, brain communication and other aspects of
viscera brain communication. They discovered a category of neurons
called the GLP1R neurons, these are neurons that are basically in your
neck, I mean, they're part of the nervous system, but they're, you
can, they can be found near your neck. And those neurons send little
wires down into the intestines and deep into the stomach, but mostly
into the intestines and they sense stretch of your intestines. So this
is pretty wild. These neurons sense how stretched out your intestines
are and how fast things are moving through your intestines, slow or
fast, or if there's nothing there. And then those neurons send another
branch, they have a branch in one direction, senses what's going on in
your intestines. And they have another branch that goes up from your
neck in your brain to either trigger the desire to eat more or just
stop eating. So these are really cool neurons and they're basically
stretch receptors. They look a lot like the piezo receptors that we
talked about before, so these GLP1R neurons are sensing stretch, so
purely mechanical sensing. And in addition to that, the Liberles Lab
discovered neurons that detect nutrients themselves. Now, the main
reason why we need to eat is to bring nutrients into our body. And
there is another set of neurons, those are called GPR65 neurons, if
you want to know, but you don't have to remember that, do the same
thing in terms of their connections. They send connections down into
the intestines and into the gut, into the stomach, but mostly into the
intestines. And then send that information back up to the brain as to
whether or not there are certain kinds of nutrients in our digestive
track. Now, these neurons are the ones to pay attention to if we're
talking about chemical signaling and then in the next couple of
minutes, I'm going to tell you about how you can understand hunger and
had a modulate your hunger for the right foods, in fact, for healthy
foods. The way this is done is by leveraging the activity of these
GPR65 neurons, these neurons that sense nutrients, okay. They're
telling your brain what's in your gut and intestines, and you have
another set of neurons that were discovered by another guy he's out at
Duke University, his name is Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges he's a
wonderful scientist. He has a degree in nutrition, but also in
neuroscience. And he found that there are neurons that line the gut,
and those neurons in collaboration with these GPR65 neurons are
sensing for three things, okay? So we say nutrients, which nutrients
are they looking for? What are these neurons paying attention to?
While these neurons are activated by the presence of fatty acids in
particular, omega-3 fatty acids, sorts of things that come from fatty
fish, oil, krill, certain kinds of animal protein, animal, and plant
substances. You can look up what has a lot of omega-3s and those
omega-3s make these neurons fire electrically like crazy up to the
brain and make you want to eat more of those things, but it turns out
in pretty appropriate levels. These neurons also respond to amino
acids. So when you eat a food, it's broken down in the gut, actually
the way it's broken down in the gut is kind of interesting. Your gut
basically cinches off a sphincter up top, cinches off a sphincter
below it when there's food there. And then you have a series of smooth
muscles that tumble the food and literally physically break it down.
And then of course, enzymes come in and start digesting the food. And
we're going to talk about digestion and how that's communicated to the
brain in a moment. And for those of you with any autoimmune issues or
digestive issues, this is going to be very important conversation. But
meanwhile there are these neurons in the gut and as these fatty acids
float out of the digested food, so literally fat molecules, and as
amino acids are coming from the proteins as they're digested in the
gut. And as a third food item, sugars are coming from the foods that
we eat. These neurons will fire a lot to the brain that says, Hey,
whatever you're doing up there, do more of it, okay? Now the sugars
are a little bit cryptic because when I say sugars or I say amino
acids, or I say fatty acids, this has nothing to do with taste. In
fact, beautiful experiments have been done by the Borges Lab and by
other labs showing that even if you numb the mouth, even if you
gavavge, which is a really, just a, it's a fancy word for basically
tube feeding, you put a tube down into the gut, you just deliver the
food to the gut. So you get no opportunity to taste, it sounds pretty
awful. If you force feed by gavage, or you numb the mouth, these
neurons don't care about the mouth. They only care about the nutrients
coming from these foods. And then they signal to the brain, hey, do
that thing, do that thing where you lift that object, we call a fork
or a spoon, do that thing where you drink the milkshake, do that thing
where you move your mouth like this, not talking, but do that thing
where you swallow. So that's how the nutrients in our gut control us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=3420"&gt;Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings with Specific Amino Acid Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is why for people that experience extreme sugar cravings, or
even mild sugar cravings, replacing those foods with foods that have
high levels of omega-3 or amino acids can produce sugar cravings. And
I've talked about this on a previous episode, but if you didn't catch
it, no big deal. I'll tell you right now that for many people, the
solution to sugar cravings is to ingest a small amount, maybe a
teaspoon or so of an amino acid called glutamine. And if you have
really extreme sugar cravings, you can even mix that glutamine with a
full-fat cream, which actually makes it taste pretty darn good. And
you drink that anytime you have a sugar craving or just a sip or two
of that. And we find is that the sugar cravings disappear, because
you're basically giving fat and amino acids to those neurons in the
gut and in the intestine, that signal to the brain that you want more.
Now, this doesn't give you a kind of runaway hunger for full fat
cream. Although it will say when I was in high school for various
reasons, but mostly because I liked the way it tastes. I was using
half and half in my cereal. And I was waking up in the middle of night
and drinking half and half, and that stuff tastes pretty darn good
once you get used to the high fat content. Not something I do now. But
the point is these neurons don't really know taste, they only know
nutrients. And so you can work with that system if you crave sugar,
and I do believe that most if not all of us should be trying to limit,
if not eliminate simple sugars, as much as possible most of the time,
then things like glutamine, things like high omega-3 foods, et cetera,
maybe even want to supplement with fish oil or something similar to
get omega-3s, there are other reasons for wanting to do that too, can
be very beneficial. And here's what we're talking about is
interoception, it's your ability to sense your inner real estate, but
in this case, by way of chemical signaling, not by way of mechanical
signaling. So now I'd like to talk about another aspect of gut
chemistry that has profound effects on the brain, as well as on the
immune system. And for those of you with auto-immune conditions,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=3538"&gt;Gut Acidity (Is Good)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or for those of you that know people with auto-immune conditions, this
is going to be a very important discussion. Your gut needs to maintain
a certain level of acidity or alkalinity, for those of you without any
chemistry background, basically the low numbers on the pH scale, that
means more acidic, the higher, the numbers, more alkaline, so more
alkaline means more basic and acidic means acidic. And it has to do
with whom hydrogen atoms and all this other stuff, but you don't need
to worry about that right now. We're not going to pH your gut right
now, but we are going to talk about the pH of your gut. Your gut needs
to be more acidic than essentially all other tissues of your body in
order to function properly, bacteria thrive in alkaline conditions. I
think this is important for people to understand. People are always
thinking, oh, you should be more alkaline being acidic, that almost
sounds like being inflamed at well, you know, it's a complicated
discussion, but I think the semantics can be confusing, sometimes you
want your gut to be acidic. You may ask, well, why are people taking
antacids? Well, those antacids are there for a particular purpose to
essentially combat acid reflux, which is the sending up of stuff in
the gut towards the esophagus. And it can cause heartburn and things
of that sort. And the way the antacids work is they essentially cause
the sphincters above the gut to sinch shut, but they really are only
dealing with a symptom, not the cause. So rewind, and about 10, 20
years ago, the discussion about gut acidity was quite a bit different
than it is now in the scientific and medical literature. In fact, for
many years long before, I'm going to say it here, people have been
saying that it's important to maintain proper acidity of the gut, but
the science and medical professions sort of looked at that as kind of
a scance like, you know, what's going on there, I don't, I don't know
that there's any evidence that that's actually true, there are
communities of people that were prescribing, or I should say
recommending that people take hydrochloric acid HCL and adjusting gut
acidity that way. And it was kind of frowned upon, now in looking over
the peer reviewed literature, it's clear that this business of trying
to make the gut a little more acidic is actually one way in which
people treat or try and ameliorate acid reflux. So it's kind of
counterintuitive increasing acidity in the gut to try and reduce acid
reflux, thought you're supposed to take antacids, well, the field has
shifted quite a bit. And so we're going to review what it is to
maintain the chemistry of the gut at a slightly more acidic level or a
more aesthetic level, I should say, because it turns out that there
are a number of things that are in gut are just call it what it is,
it's gastric juice, sounds kind of gross. But gastric juices are
actually powerful modulators of brain state. Put differently, one of
the best things that you can do to have a healthy brain, a well-
functioning brain and a healthy and well-functioning body is to
maintain proper gut chemistry. And that's basically accomplished by
getting the right level of acidity and alkalinity in your gut. Now
this is not quack pseudoscience. This is not based on cleanses or
anything of that sort. Well, we're going to talk about now are peer
reviewed data in very high quality journals, like the Journal Cell,
which is one of the three apex science nature, so,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=3740"&gt;Improving Nasal Microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and journals of that sort, that point to the gut microbiome and its
relationship to acidity of the gut and how the gut microbiome can help
enhance auto-immune function and various other aspects of brain and
body health. So within all the mucosal lining tissues of our body, we
have what are called microbiota, little micro organisms that we didn't
make that actually come from our environment or our food and live
inside us. And there are good microbiota and there are bad microbiota
whether or not we have good microbiota or bad microbiota depends on
one thing. And that one thing is how acid or alkaline the given
mucosal tissue is. So we actually have a microbiome in our nose. And
just as a very brief aside, because I'd be remiss if I didn't say
this, if you emphasize nasal breathing most of the time, except when
speaking or eating. And if you downplay mouth breathing, meaning you
refrain from mouth breathing, especially in sleep, you improve the
nasal microbiome. It gets better at fighting off infections. This was
shown in a beautiful paper, published in Cell Reports last year. And
that paper I should mention was performed in humans. So you've got a
microbiome in your nose and my nasal breathing most of the time, not
all the time. Cause there going to be times when you need to breathe
through your mouth for whatever reason, hard exercise or eating or
speaking, but by breathing through your nose, most of the time you are
creating an additional layer of immune defense against particles that
could get you sick. Whereas when you mouth breathe, you are taking
down a layer of defense and you are putting yourself more at risk of
infection. This is what this paper shows. You also have a gut
microbiome that is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=3853"&gt;Inflammation &amp;amp; Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in your throat, in your stomach and in your intestines. And that gut
microbiome is extremely powerful in regulating your mood and your
immune function. Now, this is not something that you can sense
directly. You don't know when you have a bunch of good microbiota or a
bunch of bad microbiota because you can feel them moving around in
there, actually that would be pretty awful, that would be pretty
creepy feeling. Rather that according to whether or not your gut is
alkaline or acidic in the appropriate ways, you will populate your gut
with the appropriate microbiota. So you want your stomach to be pretty
acidic, but other elements of your digestive tract are going to be
more pH. And basically there's a gradient, meaning there's a low to
high pH gradient along the gut. You don't have to know what the pH
should be at any one given point, because you're not going to go and
put microbiota at one location and not another. What you essentially
want to do is create an environment where the proper can thrive,
because when you do that, you greatly decrease what are called
inflammatory cytokines. So these are things that are secreted both by
cells, within the body and cells within the brain to impact brain
health and brain function and bodily health. They go by particular
name, so there's something called TNF alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor
Alpha. It is inflammatory. It's not a good thing to have at elevated
levels. You have something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes
inflammation, causes damage to tissues, not a good thing to have
elevated for long periods of time. And then you have anti-inflammatory
cytokines, things like Interleukin 10, which reduce inflammation. And
there are hundreds of these, if not thousands of these different
cytokines, some of which promote inflammation, some of which reduce
inflammation. The simple way to adjust these things in the proper
ratios is to adjust your gut microbiome. The best way to adjust your
microbiome is to ingest certain types of foods. So there is a
beautiful literature on this now, but the most important literature is
the one that I referred to at the beginning of this episode, which is
what to ingest and what not to ingest in terms of foods in order to
create the best conditions in your gut so that you can create the best
conditions in your brain and body. There was a study done by my
colleague, Justin Sonnenberg at Stanford School of Medicine. Justin's
actually my upstairs neighbor in the building at Stanford where I work
and they explored how different foods or different diets, I should
say, impact the gut microbiome and inflammatory markers. And this is a
beautiful study because it was done in hundreds of human patients.
These actually weren't patients that were sick, I should say human
subjects that were otherwise healthy from a huge variety of
backgrounds, so you had men, you had women, you had people of
different races, different ethnicities. You had a huge range of
backgrounds and they tracked all of that. And what they did is they
explored two types of diets. One is a high fiber diet. So dietary
fibers are non-digestible are only partially digestible carbohydrates
typically. And they compared that to diets that were unchanged, except
for the inclusion of a few, to a few more servings of fermented foods,
each day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, they even
explored, it sounds pretty disgusting to me, but who knows, I've never
tried it, which is fermented cottage cheese. And what they found was
that after initial period of a few weeks, where they had people either
eat a lot of fiber or eat one or two servings of fermented foods, they
had those people ramp up their ingestion of either fiber or fermented
foods, so they kind of ease them into it. As they went baseline then
ramp up to the point where they were ingesting, you know, four or five
servings of fiber or of fermented foods per day, which sounds like a
lot. But for fermented foods, that would be, you know, four or five
tablespoons of sauerkraut or kimchi. It's not quite, it's not like
huge platefuls of fermented foods. And then they looked at a number of
things. They looked at the proteome, which is a kind of like looking
at the genome, but a bunch of proteins that are made in the body. And
they did this by fecal samples, by stool samples, and they did this by
blood draw, which is great, it's a real power of this study. In fact,
the most comprehensive study that I'm aware of. By looking at these
different tissues across long periods of time, so many weeks, and then
returning people to their, to the diet that they were on before they
went into the study, they will were able to establish in a causal way,
how ingesting fibers or fibrous foods versus ingesting these fermented
foods on a daily basis could impact the gut microbiome and many
inflammatory markers and many markers of immune function and auto
immune function. And the takeaway message from this study is that the
fermented foods far out performed the high fiber diet. In fact, the
high fiber diet in some people was beneficial and in other people
caused issues with inflammation. This is very different than what I
was taught growing up and what many of us were taught. Interestingly
they also observed that people that ate the high fiber diet had
increases in certain enzymes that lend themselves to better digestion
of carbohydrates. And I think there's an important insight to come
from this. Nowadays we kind of live in the age of extremes where
people seem to either want to be carnivore or like never ingest a
vegetable, I hear they don't even like allow pepper, but they're not
even allowed, you know, sauerkraut or something like very extreme or
pure plant based, pure vegan or pure. So essentially pure carbohydrate
or pure animal protein, very extreme. I'm an omnivore, I like to eat a
mixture of different things at different times of days, but very
extreme, but this is interesting because what this, what these data
show is that perhaps ingesting a high carbohydrate high fiber diet,
which is really what these, the high-fiber condition really was
actually makes people better at digesting carbohydrates. This may
explain why people who are used to a, kind of a more paleo type or
carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates and say, oh, that doesn't
work for me, I don't feel good. It might also explain why people who
predominantly eat plant-based foods and carbohydrate foods will try
eating meat as an experiment, or because they lost a bet or whatever
it is and they'll do or desperation, or they'll do that. And then
they'll say, oh, I don't feel good when I eat meat. How good you feel,
it seems how well you can utilize that food, and how much of that food
you crave may be determined in fact, it appears is determined by your
food eating history, the types of food you eat. And I think this might
explain some of the divide and hopefully might bridge some of the
chasm between these different groups that are saying it should be one
way, or it should be another. But at the core of the study was the
bigger message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=4275"&gt;Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation &amp;amp; Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented Foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger message is that all of us should be ingesting on a regular
basis, daily basis, two to four servings of fermented foods of
different kinds. And why I say that is because the inflammatory
markers went down, the markers of auto-immune disruption went down,
and the chemistry of the gut therefore was adjusted in the appropriate
ways. Now it's not to say that high fiber is bad or that fiber is bad,
I don't want people to confuse this, but even though this is a
discussion about interoception, about sensing the self. This is a
subconscious mechanism by which the gut communicates to many organs,
including the brain. And it's been shown in other studies also in
quality peer review journals that when the correct gut microbiota are
present and these inflammatory markers are reduced, cognition improves
so ability to focus, ability to sleep ability to ward off infection
and wound healing all enhanced, in fact, even in autism spectrum
disorder, in people that struggle with various mental conditions or
disorders of the mind improving the gut microbiome seems to have
powerful effects on improving brain symptoms. Along the lines of auto-
immunity, there are a number of conditions that we call auto-immune
conditions, and we will do entire episodes about these going forward.
But for people with so-called irritable bowel syndrome, for people
with Crohn's disease, for people with leaky gut, Hashimoto's, which is
a kind of an immune system self-attack on one's thyroid gland and
things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting the gut microbiome has
been shown to be useful in positively adjusting the symptoms of all of
those, will it fix those conditions entirely? Probably not. But can it
have a significant positive impact on them? Probably, yes. There is
one thing that's worth mentioning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=4390"&gt;Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function &amp;amp; Glutamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in that list, which is leaky gut, what is leaky gut. Here, we're
talking about the guts, what is it to have a leaky gut, it sounds
awful. It sounds like something sort of like leaking out the end of
the tube, and it maybe that too, I don't know. But leaky gut is
actually because, your gut is not a tube that's continuous, one cell
it's actually made up of many cells and those cells form a barrier and
they form what are called tight junctions. If you have two cells and
you want to create a fence out of those cells, you bind them together.
The way that the body does this is to bind them together with what are
called tight junctions, these are, they go by names like claudins and
things like that, if you want to look them up. These tight junctions
form a nice barrier, like a cyclone fence, that things can't get past,
but like a cyclone fence only molecules of a certain size can go
through those holes. So you're not going to pass a soccer ball through
an intact cyclone fence, but you could pass for instance, a feather
through that fence. So leaky gut is when the conditions in the gut are
too alkaline or the gut microbiota are off in the gut, meaning
microbiota that like alkaline guts are living there. And those tight
junctions can't function at that particular pH and you create little
holes in that fence. And then what happens is when you ingest foods,
some of those foods literally leak out of the gut and into the
extracellular space and into the bloodstream. And because foods
include proteins and antibodies react to proteins, what ends up
happening in leaky gut, and the reason we talk about in auto-immune
conditions is that you start developing antibodies to particular food
proteins. And then people start feeling like they have food allergies
and they do, they actually create particular food allergies. Now, one
way to prevent leaky gut is to get the rest of the gut situation happy
by ingesting the proper foods that we talked about before, ingesting
fermented foods on a regular basis. The other is our old friend
glutamine, again. There are some data and I should say it's a limited
number of studies showing that ingesting glutamine anywhere from one
to three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut.
Now, the mechanism for that still isn't clear whether or not it's
adjusting pH or whether or not it's creating more favorable
environment for the microbiota, but it is clear that supplementing
with glutamine can, in some people enhance where I should say improve
conditions of leaky gut, so that might be useful as well. And then the
final thing about this, I want to talk about is we're talking about
chemical sensing in the gut and how that impacts wellbeing is about
gut acidity, and this I confess is a little bit controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=4550"&gt;Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are on board, this other people are not. And so I'd love
your feedback on this, if you, if you agree, please tell me if you
disagree, please tell me, but please tell me why you disagree in
particular, experience or data, although it's always better if you can
point me towards peer reviewed studies. There is a practice that some
people embrace. I'm not recommending people necessarily do this. And
you would definitely want to talk to your doctor, but where people
have food allergies or they're having mood or auto-immune issues, and
they treat this, some people recommend treating this through the
ingestion of HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now hydrochloric acid can
burn you, right? Acids can burn you, they literally can melt away
skin. You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly, but
hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form in capsule or pill
form. And there is a practice of starting to ingest one or two
hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal and then what people
will generally do is examine to see whether or not that improves their
symptoms of indigestion, how it relates to mood, how it relates to
well-being, how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera. By
changing the acidity, you also changed the way that the gut
communicates with the brain through the mechanisms we talked about
before. And there are a growing number of people embracing these
practices of taking HCL. It's often combined with other things, it's
usually combined with an enzyme and that enzyme is pepsin. So most of
these supplements come in the form betaine HCL pepsin and while
they're not a cure-all, and certainly don't want to suggest that
they're a cure-all, many people that have a hard time adjusting the pH
of their gut and have a hard time adjusting the microbiota of their
gut in the appropriate ways have benefited from taking these betaine
HCL pepsin tablets or capsules during meals. And the general
instruction is to start slow, to start with one or two, and then to
find a level that you're comfortable with that doesn't create an
excessive feeling of warmth in the stomach, it doesn't throw off your
digestion. So it takes a little bit of experimentation, again,
definitely talk to your healthcare provider before exploring this, but
this has become a very common practice for people with auto-immune
disorders and accessing the gut because it is accessible by taking
things has also become way in which people with various mental
conditions are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing.
Along these lines,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=4710"&gt;Probiotics &amp;amp; Brain Fog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to mention that there are studies that show that people that
supplement with a lot of probiotics or even prebiotics can sometimes
experience brain fog. This isn't discussed a lot and the data are a
little all over the place, but it is that we're thinking about. The
goal here is not to create as many microbiota as possible, what you
want is microbiota diversity. And I should mention this again in
reference to the Sonnenberg study, which was what the high fiber diet
does is it increases certain microbiota, but it limits their diversity
and what the fermented food diet does, or I should say the diet that
includes regular ingestion of fermented foods a few servings a day is
it increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack of microbiota diversity
has a name in the medical profession. It's called dysbiosis and
dysbiosis is bad. Dysbiosis is what you see when people are spending
long periods of time on bedrest or when they've been chronically ill,
and so here again, we're talking about creating a positive environment
in the gut, either by adjusting acidity, maybe you explore the betaine
HCL pepsin thing. I think if you have healthy digestion, if you feel
like you have a good relationship to your gut, and it has a good
relationship to you, sort of a silly phrase, because it is you and you
are it, then I don't think there's any need to pursue this, but if you
don't, that might be one avenue to pursue. However I think primary in
all of this is the fermented food findings, and it's not just one
study, it's many many findings that now bring us to a place where a
huge center of massive data are pointing us in the direction of saying
ingest fermented foods on a regular basis. I should also mention that
conditions like sarcopenia, which is the loss of muscle tissue as we
age, has been shown to be offset by improving the gut microbiota. So
while today is about interoception, we're talking about sensing, we're
also talking about subconscious sensing. What are we talking about,
subconscious sensing, we're talking about subconscious sensing of the
milieu of the body. When the milieu of the gut and the body is right,
than the brain and the immune system function very well. And so this
isn't something where you can sit back and say, oh, you know, I feel
all those good microbiota in my gut, or, oh, no, those are bad
microbiota. You can't do that unless you're going to take fecal
samples and blood samples and analyze them in the, with the extreme
exhaustive nature that the Sonnenberg and other labs do, you're not
going to get that kind of information. I know there are companies out
there that do this, and I don't want to knock on any of them, but I do
want to emphasize that to do this right, to really analyze which
cytokines you're making, which ones you're not, you really need to
look at a huge number of them. And that requires large-scale proteomic
and genomic and inflammatory markers screens. It's just not the kind
of thing that most commercial enterprises can really provide to people
in a way that they can interpret, rather, this is a case where you can
simply go to the effector, to the thing that can actually move the
needle in the right direction for you. It's very clear that's
fermented foods and that's keeping the stomach slightly more acid than
one might think you would want to. So let's talk about barfing first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=4905"&gt;Nausea: Happens in Your Brain; Area Postrema&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barfing, AKA vomiting, is when the contents of your guts run in
reverse, meaning when they go up from your stomach. Sometimes even up
from the intestines, even though that sounds horrible, it sometimes
happens up, out the esophagus and mouth and onto whatever surface
happens to be in front of you. It's a terrible thing, nobody likes to
do it, but it's a very interesting aspect of our biology because it
reveals a beautiful and absolutely fundamental relationship between
our chemistry and our brain. So your brain is actually locked behind a
gate and that gate is not your skull. That gate is the so-called
blood-brain barrier. So just like your gut has these epithelial tight
junctions, the things I talked about before that provide a fence, so
things can't get through and get through in leaky gut, your brain has
tight junctions that are very tight. It's absolutely fundamental that
only certain molecules get across the blood brain barrier and that
others don't. And the reason for that is that most all 99.99999% of
your neurons do not regenerate, I don't care what you've read,
especially in the news recently about how psychedelics cause
neurogenesis, because they don't, it's absolutely wrong. Psychedelics
have effects on brain plasticity, but they have nothing to do with
neurogenesis, at least no data to support it, but because you can't
make new neurons, you also can't damage the ones you've got, or you
shouldn't as much as possible. And that's why you have a blood brain
barrier or a BBB. So the BBB as it's called prevents substances from
getting to the brain, however, like any fence, it is not always
uniform along its length. And there are little spots within that fence
where chemicals can sneak across to the brain and through a beautiful
design, I don't know anything about the design. As I always say, I
wasn't consulted the design phase. I'm not talking about any kind of
intelligent design or anything that is not the topic of this podcast.
This is not a philosophy podcast, nor is it a religion podcast, it's a
science podcast, but through a beautiful design of some sort, there
are little holes in that fence. And they're little neurons that sit
right behind those holes and those neurons sense what the chemistry of
the blood is. So I'm guessing you probably didn't imagine that today's
discussion about sensing the self would be sensing your own blood, but
you do. There's a little area of your brain, that's little indeed, but
is very important called area postrema P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. And area
postrema is an area of the brainstem that sits right next to another
brain area called the chemo receptor trigger zone. And when the
contents in your bloodstream are of a particular kind, meaning when
there are pathogens or it's too acidic, the neurons and area postrema
the neurons in the chemo receptor trigger zone, the CTZ as it's
called, trigger a bunch of motor reflexes in the abdominal wall that
make you barf. Okay, the feeling that you need to throw up is
triggered by these neurons in the brain stem. And those neurons in the
brainstem are triggered by the presence of certain chemicals. And the
reason why you don't have any blood brain barrier at that location is
because post-trauma has to be there like a crossing guard, making sure
that everything that's coming through the blood is okay, and if it
even senses just the tiniest bit, that things are off, it's going to
trigger that reflex. Now, the really interesting thing is that the
neurons and area postrema respond to the chemistry of the blood, but
they also will respond to our consciousness, to things that we think
and things that we believe and even particular memories. This is why
when certain people see vomit or see someone else vomit, or even
somebody else heaving, as if they're going to vomit, they themselves
feel as if they're going to vomit. I'm guessing they're probably even
a few of you right now that feel like you might vomit. You might feel
salivation in your throat, which is always a precursor to vomiting.
Some people, the memory of, or the thought of something like blood or
vomit or, use your imagination, can actually trigger the vomit reflex.
And that's because these neurons in area are very sensitive to prior
experience of interactions with negative things. So and actually, as
I'm saying this, I feel my gut kind of cramping up again, I'm not, I
don't vomit very easily, I'm not one of those, nor am I somebody who's
never vomited. And here we are talking about my vomit history, but I
think it's appropriate in this, in this context, the neurons of area,
or they're basically to keep your whole system safe and thank goodness
they are, because for instance, some people, unfortunately, they drink
so much alcohol that they throw up. Have you ever wondered why that
is? Well it's because alcohol fundamentally is a poison. I'm not
saying for, you know, age appropriate folks that ingesting alcohol is
bad. This isn't a judgment call, but alcohol itself at excessive
levels in the bloodstream triggers post-trauma to cause vomiting. So
this is an example, whereby memories, context, but also just the
chemistry of our internal state is triggering behaviors that are very
hardwired. They're very reflux driven. And why would it be that some
people get more nauseous than others at a given level, well, they'll
have to do with alcohol tolerance. Some people have what's called a,
you know, we refer to as a stronger stomach or a stomach of steel.
Other people they throw out very easily if they don't feel well, or if
they ingest anything that's just a little bit off. From a purely
adaptive standpoint, it's probably better to vomit up things that
aren't good for you rather than to have them pass through your system.
Especially if those things are contained in lipids. For instance if
you ingest something that's in liquid form because cells, literally
every cell in your body is surrounded by a little thin layer of fatty
tissue, we call the bilayer membrane, it's a little membrane. Fat can
move through fat very easily. And so any bad stuff you ingest can get
stuck in your system. So let's talk for a second about how to reduce
nausea, because nausea is that salivation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=5305"&gt;Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that feeling that you're going to vomit, can be very beneficial in an,
in an adaptive circumstance. Like you've ingested something bad, but
some people experience nausea, for other reasons, there are good ways
to regulate nausea and the ways they regulate nausea, very
interesting. They actually adjust the activity of these neurons in
area postrema or they change the chemistry of the blood directly. And
many of you have heard this before, perhaps, but it turns out that
there are good data, 11 research studies where the ones that I could
find peer reviewed research studies with no bias, so independent
studies showing that ginger can cause a notable reduction in nausea,
how much ginger, one to three grams, what's one to three grams where
you have to measure it out on a scale, unless you're taking it in pill
or capsule form. It doesn't seem to matter if you take it in pill or
capsule form, so this thing that you've heard before that ginger can
reduce nausea, indeed is true. Peppermint, apparently can also do
that. And some of you will not be surprised to learn that cannabis can
reduce nausea, not surprise because cannabis, which has different
legality in different places, and I understand that, so please take
that into consideration. But cannabis, THC and, or it turns out CBD
can reduce nausea, that's been shown in at least one study. And it
probably does that, not by changing the chemistry of your blood, but
by changing the threshold for firing of these neurons in area post-
trauma. And there are conditions such as in chemotherapy and radiation
therapy and others where people are feeling very nauseous, I'm not
recommending people go use cannabis, unless they've decided with their
selves and their family and their doctor that they should. But what's
interesting is this thing about CBD and we'll do a whole episode on
THC and CBD doesn't have, or isn't supposed to have these psychoactive
properties that THC does. Although CBD can have a mild to major
anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, but it does appear that the data
are what the data support. I should say, the anecdotal reports, which
are that cannabis can reduce nausea. So to barf less, ginger,
peppermint, and if appropriate and legal for you, possibly cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=5440"&gt;Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk about fever. In previous episodes, and in future
episodes, we deal with thermal regulation, which is the body's ability
to regulate its temperature. Talk about cold and heat and saunas and
ice baths and physical performance. We're not going to deal with all
that right now, but I promise we will going forward. Today, I only
want to talk about fever because fever directly relates to
interoception. What do I mean by that? Well, a fever is simply an
increase in body temperature, that increase in body temperature is
triggered by neurons in the brain. And those neurons in the brain are
triggered by the presence of particular things in the bloodstream.
What sorts of things? Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, when something
bad gets in our system, the body doesn't know it's bad, it just knows
it's foreign, and it hasn't seen it before. Or that it's in the wrong
compartment of the body. So earlier we were talking about proteins
that leak out of the gut and get elsewhere, you know, you don't want a
piece of steak sitting in your bicep. That would be bad, you would
actually develop antibodies, you would have a horrible infection. But
your body has this intelligence, and that intelligence is to know,
Hmm, these proteins are normally not seen in this region and then your
body or the cells there, I should say, we'll release something that
then will travel to the brain and will trigger an increase in body
temperature so that your body cooks the bad thing or the cause of the
bad thing. It's really a beautiful adaptive mechanism. We always think
fever is so terrible, but fever is there to cook the bad thing that's
inside you, or that has left the correct compartment inside you and is
in the wrong compartment inside you. So what's beautiful about the
fever mechanism is that it looks a lot like the barfing mechanism.
Basically you have a set of neurons that sit near the ventricles,
remember the ventrals is hole in the tube, that is you, the tube that
is, you are a tube, a series of tubes. And your brain has a hole down
the middle. And it extends down to the bottom of your spinal cord, at
the front, it's called the ventricles, they start with what are called
the lateral ventricles and the excuse me, starts with the third and
the lateral ventricles, and then it goes to the fourth ventricle and
then to what's called the central canal. But basically is just a big
space in the middle of your nervous system in the middle of your
brain. And you have one ventricle that I already mentioned called the
third ventricle. And it's shaped kind of like a thin oval up upright,
if you're listening to this, just think an I, the shape of an I, but
it's kind of rotated 90 degrees. So it's up and down as opposed to
across. And along that third ventricle, there's there a little neurons
that can sense what's in the cerebral spinal fluid that fills the
ventricle. So in other words, you have neurons that are sensing the
chemistry of your cerebral spinal fluid, and that have access
therefore to the chemistry of your body. Because that cerebral spinal
fluid is going up and down the brain and spinal cord. But into that
cerebral spinal fluid are signals about the various chemicals within
the body. So this is not a mechanical system. This is a chemical
system. Remember we're talking about mechanical information and
chemical information accessing the brain. So if you have something bad
in your system, you've ingested a, you breathe in a virus or you
inhaled some bacteria, or you got a cut on your leg and some bacteria
are growing there. Of course, locally, there will be effects, little
things called the mast cell. This M-A-S-T little packets of histamine
literally will go there and explode [poofs] and cause inflammation,
which is actually a good inflammation. And we'll release little things
called macrophages to gobble up the infection. The other day, it was
in Texas, it was some mean little mosquitoes in Texas, and a lot of
them, and I would stand outside and I'd get bitten, I didn't feel a
thing, but then later that night, they started swelling up and itching
and then I'd itch them, and then they'd swell even more. That was
because of the release of mass cells, of histamines inside those mass
cells that would literally causing inflammation of the tissue. It
wasn't the poison from the mosquito itself. It was the immune response
to those. Well, you also have this systemic or body-wide attempt to
kill stuff, and that's the fever. So the neurons that these ventricles
with cerebral spinal fluid go by a particular name, they're called
circumventricular organs, meaning near circum, ventricular near the
ventricles. And you have these organs and there are a set of neurons,
has a really cool name called the OVLT. I don't know why I like that,
but I just like it, it's the organum vasculosum of the lateral
terminalis organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis, OVLT are the
neurons that respond to toxins and bad stuff in your bloodstream,
however minor or major. And they release things like ILK-1, which are
inflammatory cytokines inflammatory in this case is good, you want
inflammation at the site of an infection. It's a good thing. It's
going to help with healing. And it's going to change the conditions in
your body, what's going to happen is when those OVLT neurons are
activated, because you have something bad in your body or something
bad is happening in your body, they communicate with an area of the
brain called the preoptic area of your hypothalamus and the preoptic
area cranks up your temperature and tries to cook that bad thing. Now
it's worth talking about fever for a moment and talking about thermal
regulation, because I think this actually could save some lives. So if
you are overheated to a point where, you know, you're getting up past
102 or 103, it's going to vary depending on person to person and
certainly age, you know, kids, some people think can tolerate higher
levels of fever than adults, but look, you always want to be cautious
about heating up the brain too much, because once those neurons are
gone, they do not come back and neurons do not do well in very high
temperatures. Once your body temperature starts getting up to 102,
103, certainly 104, you are starting to enter serious danger zone.
This can happen through exercise in hot environments or an inability
to escape heat because you don't have covering or adequate ventilation
or cooling. It can also be because of excessive fever, for whatever
reason. A lot of people think the way to deal with this is to put a
cool compress on the back of the neck or to cool the torso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=5820"&gt;Protocol 10: Cooling the Blood Properly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussing this with my colleague, Craig Heller who's at Stanford
School of Medicine, and he's on the undergraduate side of the campus
as well, runs a biology lab. He's a world expert in thermal
regulation. It's very clear that that's the wrong response to try and
cool off the body. If you put a cold towel or you put an ice pack on
the back of the neck, what you effectively do is cool the blood that's
going to the brain. And if you do that, then your brain will react by
turning up the crank in so to speak on the neurons in the pre optic
area, and will heat you up further and can cook your brain and organs
further. So what you want to do is, as I've talked about before, you
want to cool the bottoms of the feet, the palms of the hands and the
upper part of the face. And I'm not going to go into all the details
as to why you want to do that right now, but those are the locations
you want to cool. Now you can also cool the rest of the body, but it's
not okay to just stay under the covers and just cool, you know, the
neck or something like that. You really want to try and create a
systemic or whole body cooling, if the goal is to bring fever down,
but in many cases, fever is adaptive. And so taking a non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil and Tylenol sometimes can be good,
if that's recommended, but other times, because it reduces your fever,
it's allowing that pathogen, that pyrogen, it's sometimes called, a
pyrogen is a substance that causes fever, think pyro, think fire,
think pyromaniacs, think pyro, those pyrogens can survive at moderate
to low temperatures, and they can't survive at high temperatures. So
the fever is an adaptive mechanism and the OVLT, and the sensing of
your chemistry is how the OVLT, organum vasculosum of the lateral
terminalis does that. So we've talked about sensing lung volume,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=5933"&gt;Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;speed of our heartbeat, we talked about sensing the gut volume, the
intestinal volume, or the absence of volume. We talked about chemistry
of the gut and the gut microbiota and auto immune functions. And we've
now talked about vomiting, and we've talked about fever, lots of
aspects of sensing our internal self. Now I want to turn our attention
to interoception as it relates to feelings, the way that interoception
is most commonly described. And I want to highlight a term that many
of you have probably heard, which is the vagus nerve. We talked about
vagus a little bit earlier, but the vagus nerve, this vagabonding
wandering nerve is involved in everything I've talked about up until
now. And the reason I saved it till now, rather than mentioning all
along is to highlight a specific point, which is that whenever we hear
about the vagus in popular culture, it's like the vagus calms you
down, you want to stimulate the vagus by rubbing in front of the ear,
and it's a parasympathetic nerve, and it will calm you down, he'll
mellow you out. Actually, most of the time, the vagus is stimulatory.
When you ingest foods with amino acids, sugars, or fatty acids, the
vagus nerve gets activated and triggers the release of dopamine, it
makes you more alert and go seek more of those foods or what led to
those conditions. When you feel nauseous it's rarely calming, when you
feel like you have a fever, it's rarely calming. So you're starting to
get the picture that even though the vagus nerve is in the
parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. And if that
doesn't mean anything to you, because you're not in aficionado, don't
worry about it. But it's not a calming system, it's a communication
system, and it's a motor system. It communicates brain to body and
body to brain, and it changes the function of different organs, now,
one thing that's important to highlight is that stress itself will
alter the chemistry of your gut because of the ways that it down the
vagus nerve and quiets the neurons that communicate from gut to brain.
I want to say that again, stress will disrupt your gut and make you
feel not good, poor digestion, and just lousy, because of the way that
it shuts down the vagus nerve and the neurons of your gut. So what
stress does is it blocks the communication between gut and brain, it
doesn't mess up your gut. It just doesn't let your gut get the signals
up to your brain, and it also then throws off the chemistry. And then
there's a whole cascade of effects. If you want to learn more about
stress, I did a whole episode called "Master Stress," or I think maybe
it was called "Conquer Stress" and it was "Master Stress," either one.
The whole point of that episode is to give you tools and practices to
deal with short term, acute stress, moderate term stress, and long-
term chronic stress through behavioral mechanisms, nutrition,
supplementation, and many other things as well. It's chockablock full
of protocols and tools for stress. The vagus nerve, however,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=6110"&gt;Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is responsible for emotion and the way it does that is to pool, to
aggregate the conditions of your gut, the conditions of your heart and
the conditions of your breathing, which includes your diaphragm and
lungs and takes that kind of as a collection of information and sends
it to the brain and controls what we call your emotions. Now that
might seem obvious to some people, but to other people that might seem
totally crazy. You thought your emotions were because the market was
down and you had invested, or because something that you thought was
going to happen is not going to happen, or because you thought that
school was open and then it's not, or maybe thought it wasn't, and it
is whatever it is that bothers you, you think of generally as a purely
cognitive event. But the brain doesn't really know what to do with
that information. It doesn't act directly on that information to
create moods. Moods are created through the heart's response to
reading that headline, to the change in your breathing, that's caused
by someone that you love telling you that actually they're not
interested in spending time with you anymore, or that you screwed up
or that they're interested in spending a lot of time with you and you
like that, right? Emotions can be good or bad or neutral. So this
thing that we call interoception, the sense of self I've been building
up from very fundamental layers, gut chemistry, spleens, immune
systems, auto-immune and you might've been thinking, wait, I thought
this was going to be about a sense of self, a noticing or a feeling.
And indeed all of those things are plugging in like a series of
ingredients in a recipe that gives rise to your mood and how you feel,
and that mood and how you feel is shown in one location in your body
that other people can see. And that's in your facial expressions. And
indeed there are now beautiful data showing that your face, including
the size of your pupils, the tonality of your face, how flushed you
are, or how pale you are, even the degree to which you're frowning or
smiling relative to other periods of time, that is all an aggregate
of, or a reflection rather of your gut, your heart and your breathing
and the chemistry of your body. And so this is why I sort of backed
into this conversation about interoception I kind of Trojan horse this
on you on purpose which is that when we talk about the vagus and you
hear, oh, you know, you can get vagal tone by breathing or rubbing on
the front of the or short that's probably true, but another
fundamental layer is the acidity of your gut, how fast your breathing
are you inhale-emphasized, or exhale-emphasized breathing. When we are
relaxed our pupils tend to constrict. When we are very alert, our
pupils tend to be dilated, whether or not that alertness has to do
with being happy or being sad. And what's remarkable, and this is
where interoception really takes a leap into the incredible is that
there are beautiful studies that show&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=6300"&gt;Sensing Other People’s Emotions via the Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that for instance, when we know somebody pretty well and they are
going through some sort of experience of any kind, our heart rate
actually starts to mimic their heart rate. Our breathing starts to
mimic their breathing, even if we aren't conscious of their breathing.
It's not like we see their chest heaving, and we think, oh my
goodness, and then we breathe that way. There's a mirroring and no
it's not carried out through mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are more
of a myth and a reality, sorry to burst people's bubbles. But that
bubble around mirror neurons is definitely made of myths and a topic
for another time, but we start to mirror. Somehow human beings are
able to register the internal state of other beings, and I think
probably for animals too, but certainly for other humans, even at a
distance. And these studies are many now, and they're really wonderful
studies. And so your sense of your internal landscape is linked to
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9QKc-iFoY&amp;amp;t=6360"&gt;Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can enhance this interoceptive capacity for how you feel and
how others feel, in other words, you can start getting a better
readout of your internal state by doing a simple exercise, what is
really a tool. And that is to learn to sense your heartbeats. So some
people are very good at this, other people are not, some people can do
this more easily when they have all their air exhaled and some people
can do it better when they are holding a breath hold. But one thing
that's kind of cool about this whole interoceptive capacity is that
you can enhance it very quickly. You can learn or teach yourself to
have heightened levels of interoception in a way that you can't really
just give yourself heightened levels of vision by snapping your
fingers, in one of one tool or exercise, there are things you can do
to improve vision. That's the topic of a previous episode. I encourage
you to look it up. There are things you can do to improve your hearing
and your taste and your smell, we talked about all those, but with
interoception you can get very good at this very fast. And I think
this is one of the reasons why meditation is powerful. Think there are
a lot of reasons why meditation is powerful, but one of the reasons is
when you stop taking in exteroceptive information from the outside
world, by closing your eyes and focusing inward, as they say, you
start paying attention to your breathing cadence, you start directing
your mind's attention to your heart rate, and if you can start to
perceive your heart beating. You actually are very quickly strengthen
the vagal connections between the body and the brain. And so there's
no real practice here. There's no breathe this way or do this thing
except to direct your awareness toward your heartbeat. And some people
can get very good at this very fast. Most people find that just by
doing this for a minute or so, every once in a while, they start to
tap into this sixth sense. They start to notice when they don't feel
quite right about something or somebody or some situation, or they
start to notice when they feel quite right about somebody or something
or some situation. So this interoceptive awareness can be tuned up. It
used to be called vagal tone, but I think that term doesn't take into
account all the other things that are going on with the vagus. So I
don't really like that term. It's more of an interoceptive awareness.
And again, there are many studies now showing that for sake of
bettering one's mood overall, for sake of moving through a challenging
phase in life, for sake of just enhancing one's experience of life
overall, whether or not it's the taste of foods, interactions with
other people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning up one's
interoceptive awareness is both easy again by just taking a minute or
two and trying to count heartbeats. And then this works best, of
course, if you have some independent readout of heartbeats and you can
compare, you can see how accurate you are, but even if you don't use a
device or have a device to do that, without taking your pulse, using
your thumb on your wrist or something, or your fingers on your neck,
as you typically would for taking your pulse, trying to sit still for
a minute or two every once in a while, maybe once a week, maybe twice
a week, maybe while you're meditating, maybe while breathwork, maybe
during the breath holds of breathwork, you don't really have to do
this in any kind of extended way, you can very quickly increase your
interoceptive tone. And that has a huge and outsized effect on the
brain, body relationship and your brain's ability to tap into both the
subconscious and the conscious aspects of this chemical and mechanical
signaling that's happening all the time. And it can have real and out-
sized positive effects on your ability to engage with other people and
your ability to focus at work and your ability to notice, ah, I'm
finding myself kind of feeling like I'm losing focus, but really it
was my heart rate was just increasing. Maybe I just exhale a little
bit and bring my heart rate down. So whatever effectually tried to do
today is to give you a window into this incredible relationship
between your viscera and your brain and your brain and your viscera,
all these organs of your body, and what I hope is that you'll
appreciate that it's a system, that you aren't just a system of tubes.
I said that in a sort of in jest, I mean, you have a lot of tubes and
you are a system of tubes, but that system of tubes is linked through
the nervous system, and those links work in very specific ways. So
whether or not you remember about pesos and all the GLPRs and all that
stuff, it doesn't really matter. What I encourage you to do is start
sort of pushing and pulling on the various leavers within this
beautiful system that we call the interoceptive system, this sense of
self.&lt;/p&gt;

course of today's episode, and on previous episodes, I mentioned
supplements. I realized supplements aren't for everybody, but for
those of you that are interested in supplements, it is important that
the supplements that you take have a high level of stringency with
respect to the amounts of the contents that are listed on the bottle
matching what's actually in the bottle, in the capsules and tablets,
and that the quality of those ingredients be extremely high. For that
reason we partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E because Thorne
supplements have the highest levels of stringency for both the content
and the amount of content in those bottles and supplements. If you
want to try Thorne supplements, and you want to see the supplements
that I take, you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman. And you can see all

&lt;p&gt;[bright music] Welcome to the "Huberman Lab Podcast," where we discuss
science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. Today I have the pleasure of introducing
Dr. Lex Fridman as our guest on the "Huberman Lab Podcast." Dr.
Fridman is a researcher at MIT specializing in machine learning,
artificial intelligence and human robot interactions. I must say that
the conversation with Lex was without question, one of the most
fascinating conversations that I've ever had, not just in my career,
but in my lifetime. I knew that Lex worked on these topics. And I
think many of you are probably familiar with Lex and his interest in
these topics from his incredible podcast, the "Lex Fridman Podcast."
If you're not already watching that podcast, please subscribe to it.
It is absolutely fantastic. But in holding this conversation with Lex,
I realized something far more important. He revealed to us a bit of
his dream. His dream about humans and robots, about humans and
machines, and about how those interactions can change the way that we
perceive ourselves and that we interact with the world. We discuss
relationships of all kinds, relationships with animals, relationships
with friends, relationships with family and romantic relationships.
And we discuss relationships with the machines. Machines that move and
machines that don't move, and machines that come to understand us in
ways that we could never understand for ourselves, and how those
machines can educate us about ourselves. Before this conversation, I
had no concept of the ways in which machines could inform me or anyone
about themselves. By the end, I was absolutely taken with the idea,
and I'm still taken with the idea that interactions with machines have
a very particular kind, a kind that Lex understands and wants to bring
to the world, can not only transform the self, but may very well
transform humanity. So whether or not you're familiar with Dr. Lex
Fridman or not, I'm certain you're going to learn a tremendous amount
from him during the course of our discussion, and that it will
transform the way that you think about yourself and about the world.
Before we begin, I want to mention that this podcast is separate from
my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my
desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about
science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping
with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that
are of absolutely phenomenal quality. The company was founded by two
All-American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about the
sunglasses and eyeglasses they've designed had performance in mind.
I've spent a career working on the visual system. And one of the
fundamental issues that your visual system has to deal with is how to
adjust what you see when it gets darker or brighter in your
environment. With ROKA Sunglasses and Eyeglasses, whether or not it's
dim in the room or outside, or not there's cloud cover, or whether or
not you walk into a shadow, you can always see the world with absolute
clarity. And that just tells me that they really understand the way
that the visual system works. Processes like habituation and
attenuation. All these things that work at a real mechanistic level
have been built into these glasses. In addition, the glasses are very
lightweight. You don't even notice really that they're on your face.
And the quality of the lenses is terrific. Now, the glasses were also
designed so that you could use them, not just while working or at
dinner, et cetera, but while exercising. They don't fall off your face
or slip off your face if you're sweating. And as I mentioned, they're
extremely lightweight. So you can use them while running, you can use
them while cycling and so forth. Also the aesthetic of ROKA glasses is
terrific. Unlike a lot of performance glasses out there, which frankly
make people look like cyborgs, these glasses look great. You can wear
them out to dinner, you can wear them for essentially any occasion. If
you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to roka.com. That's R-O-K-A

Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker
is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your
blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you
reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood
work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact
our immediate and long-term health can only be assessed from a quality
blood test. And now with the advent of quality DNA tests, we can also
get insight into some of our genetic underpinnings of our current and
long-term health. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out
there, however, is you get the data back and you don't know what to do
with those data. You see that certain things are high or certain
things are low, but you really don't know what the actionable items
are, what to do with all that information. With InsideTracker, they
make it very easy to act in the appropriate ways on the information
that you get back from those blood and DNA tests. And that's through
the use of their online platform. They have a really easy to use
dashboard that tells you what sorts of things can bring the numbers
for your metabolic factors, endocrine factors, et cetera, into the
ranges that you want and need for immediate and long-term health. In
fact, I know one individual just by way of example, that was feeling
good, but decided to go with an InsideTracker test and discovered that
they had high levels of what's called C-reactive protein. They would
have never detected that otherwise. C-reactive protein is associated
with a number of deleterious health conditions, some heart issues, eye
issues, et cetera. And so they were able to take immediate action to
try and resolve those CRP levels. And so with InsideTracker, you get
that sort of insight. And as I mentioned before, without a blood or
DNA test, there's no way you're going to get that sort of insight
until symptoms start to show up. If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans. You just use the code Huberman at checkout.
That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans. Today's podcast is brought to us by Athletic
Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic
drink. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. And so I'm
delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is
that it covers all of my vitamin mineral probiotic basis. In fact,
when people ask me, what should I take? I always suggest that the
first supplement people take is Athletic Greens, for the simple
reason, is that the things that contains covers your bases for
metabolic health, endocrine health, and all sorts of other systems in
the body. And the inclusion of probiotics are essential for a healthy
gut microbiome. There are now tons of data showing that we have
neurons in our gut, and keeping those neurons healthy requires that
they are exposed to what are called the correct microbiota, little
microorganisms that live in our gut and keep us healthy. And those
neurons in turn help keep our brain healthy. They influence things
like mood, our ability to focus, and many, many other factors related
to health. With Athletic Greens, it's terrific, because it also tastes
really good. I drink it once or twice a day. I mix mine with water and
I add a little lemon juice, or sometimes a little bit of lime juice.
If you want to try athletic greens, you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you can claim their
special offer. They're giving away five free travel packs, little
packs that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the
road. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3 and K2. Again,
go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim that special offer. And
now, my conversation with Dr. Lex Fridman. We meet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=455"&gt;What is Artificial Intelligence?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet again. Thanks so much for sitting down with me. I have a
question that I think is on a lot of people's minds or ought to be on
a lot of people's minds, because we hear these terms a lot these days,
but I think most people, including most scientists and including me
don't know really what is artificial intelligence, and how is it
different from things like machine learning and robotics? So, if you
would be so kind as to explain to us, what is artificial intelligence,
and what is machine learning? Well, I think that question is as
complicated and as fascinating as the question of, what is
intelligence? So, I think of artificial intelligence, first, as a big
philosophical thing. Pamela McCormick said AI was the ancient wish to
forge the gods, or was born as an ancient wish to forge the gods. So I
think at the big philosophical level, it's our longing to create other
intelligence systems. Perhaps systems more powerful than us. At the
more narrow level, I think it's also set of tools that are
computational mathematical tools to automate different tasks. And then
also it's our attempt to understand our own mind. So, build systems
that exhibit some intelligent behavior in order to understand what is
intelligence in our own selves. So all of those things are true. Of
course, what AI really means as a community, as a set of researchers
and engineers, it's a set of tools, a set of computational techniques
that allow you to solve various problems. There's a long history that
approaches the problem from different perspectives. What's always been
throughout one of the threads, one of the communities goes under the
flag of machine learning, which is emphasizing in the AI space, the
task of learning. How do you make a machine that knows very little in
the beginning, follow some kind of process and learns to become better
and better at a particular task? What's been most very effective in
the recent about 15 years is a set of techniques that fall under the
flag of deep learning that utilize neural networks. When your networks
are these fascinating things inspired by the structure of the human
brain, very loosely, but they have a, it's a network of these little
basic computational units called neurons, artificial neurons. And they
have, these architectures have an input and output. They know nothing
in the beginning, and their task with learning something interesting.
What that's something interesting is, usually involves a particular
task. There's a lot of ways to talk about this and break this down.
Like one of them is how much human supervision is required to teach
this thing. So supervised learning is broad category, is the neural
network knows nothing in the beginning and then it's given a bunch of
examples in computer vision that will be examples of cats, dogs, cars,
traffic signs, and then you're given the image and you're given the
ground truth of what's in that image. And when you get a large
database of such image examples where you know the truth, the neural
network is able to learn by example, that's called supervised
learning. There's a lot of fascinating questions within that, which
is, how do you provide the truth? When you given an image of a cat,
how do you provide to the computer that this image contains a cat? Do
you just say the entire image is a picture of a cat? Do you do what's
very commonly been done, which is a bounding box, you have a very
crude box around the cat's face saying, this is a cat? Do you do
semantic segmentation? Mind you, this is a 2D image of a cat. So it's
not, the computer knows nothing about our three-dimensional world, is
just looking at a set of pixels. So, semantic segmentation is drawing
a nice, very crisp outline around the cat and saying, that's a cat.
That's really difficult to provide that truth. And one of the
fundamental open questions in computer vision is, is that even a good
representation of the truth? Now, there's another contrasting set of
ideas that our attention they're overlapping is, well, it's used to be
called unsupervised learning. What's commonly now called self-
supervised learning. Which is trying to get less and less and less
human supervision into the task. So self-supervised learning is more,
it's been very successful in the domain of language model, natural
English processing, and now more and more as being successful in
computer vision task. And the idea there is, let the machine without
any ground-truth annotation just look at pictures on the internet, or
look at texts on the internet and try to learn something generalizable
about the ideas that are at the core of language or at the core of
vision. And based on that, we humans at its best like to call that
common sense. So with this, we have this giant base of knowledge on
top of which we build more sophisticated knowledge. We have this kind
of commonsense knowledge. And so the idea with self-supervised
learning is to build this commonsense knowledge about, what are the
fundamental visual ideas that make up a cat and a dog and all those
kinds of things without ever having human supervision? The dream there
is the, you just let an AI system that's self supervised run around
the internet for awhile, watch YouTube videos for millions and
millions of hours, and without any supervision be primed and ready to
actually learn with very few examples once the human is able to show
up. We think of children in this way, human children, is your parents
only give one or two examples to teach a concept. The dream with self-
supervised learning is that will be the same with machines. That they
would watch millions of hours of YouTube videos, and then come to a
human and be able to understand when the human shows them, this is a
cat. Like, remember this' a cat. They will understand that a cat is
not just the thing with pointy ears, or a cat is a thing that's
orange, or is furry, they'll see something more fundamental that we
humans might not actually be able to introspect and understand. Like,
if I asked you, what makes a cat versus a dog, you wouldn't probably
not be able to answer that, but if I showed you, brought to you a cat
and a dog, you'll be able to tell the difference. What are the ideas
that your brain uses to make that difference? That's the whole dream
with self-supervised learning, is it would be able to learn that on
its own. That set of commonsense knowledge, that's able to tell the
difference. And then there's like a lot of incredible uses of self-
supervised learning, very weirdly called self-play mechanism. That's
the mechanism behind the reinforcement learning successes of the
systems that won at Go, at, AlphaZero that won a chess. Oh, I see.
That play games? [Lex] That play games. Got it. So the idea of self-
play is probably, applies to other domains than just games. Is a
system that just plays against itself. And this is fascinating in all
kinds of domains, but it knows nothing in the beginning. And the whole
idea is it creates a bunch of mutations of itself and plays against
those versions of itself. And the fascinating thing is when you play
against systems that are a little bit better than you, you start to
get better yourself. Like learning, that's how learning happens.
That's true for martial arts. It's true in a lot of cases. Where you
want to be interacting with systems that are just a little better than
you. And then through this process of interacting with systems just a
little better than you, you start following this process where
everybody starts getting better and better and better and better until
you are several orders of magnitude better than the world champion in
chess, for example. And it's fascinating because it's like a runaway
system. One of the most terrifying and exciting things that David
Silver, the creator of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, one of the leaders of
the team said, to me is a, they haven't found the ceiling for
AlphaZero. Meaning it could just arbitrarily keep improving. Now, in
the realm of chess, that doesn't matter to us. That it's like, it just
ran away with the game of chess. Like it's like just so much better
than humans. But the question is what, if you can create that in the
realm that does have a bigger, deeper effect on human beings and
societies, that can be a terrifying process. To me, it's an exciting
process if you supervise it correctly, if you inject, if what's called
value alignment, you make sure that the goals that the AI is
optimizing is aligned with human beings and human societies. There's a
lot of fascinating things to talk about within the specifics of neural
networks and all the problems that people are working on. But I would
say the really big, exciting one is self-supervised learning. We're
trying to get less and less human supervision, less and less human
supervision of neural networks. And also just a comment and I'll shut
up. No, please keep going. I'm learning. I have questions, but I'm
learning. So please keep going. So, to me what's exciting is not the
theory, it's always the application. One of the most exciting
applications of artificial intelligence, specifically neural networks
and machine learning is Tesla Autopilot. So these are systems that are
working in the real world. This isn't an academic exercise. This is
human lives at stake. This is safety-critical. These are automated
vehicles. Autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. We want to be. Okay.
We've gone through wars on these topics, Semi-autonomous vehicles.
Semi-autonomous. So, even though it's called a FSD, Full Self-Driving,
it is currently not fully autonomous, meaning human supervision is
required. So, human is tasked with overseeing the systems. In fact,
liability-wise, the human is always responsible. This is a human
factor psychology question, which is fascinating. I'm fascinated by
the whole space, which is a whole 'nother space of human robot
interaction when AI systems and humans work together to accomplish
tasks. That dance to me is one of the smaller communities, but I think
it will be one of the most important open problems once they're
solved, is how the humans and robots dance together. To me, semi-
autonomous driving is one of those spaces. So for Elon, for example,
he doesn't see it that way, he sees semi-autonomous driving as a
stepping stone towards fully autonomous driving. Like, humans and
robots can't dance well together. Like, humans and humans dance and
robots and robots dance. Like, we need to, this is an engineering
problem, we need to design a perfect robot that solves this problem.
To me forever, maybe this is not the case with driving, but the world
is going to be full of problems with always humans and robots have to
interact, because I think robots will always be flawed, just like
humans are going to be flawed, are flawed. And that's what makes life
beautiful, that they're flawed. That's where learning happens at the
edge of your capabilities. So you always have to figure out, how can
flawed robots and flawed humans interact together such that they, like
the sum is bigger than the whole, as opposed to focusing on just
building the perfect robot? Mm-hmm. So that's one of the most exciting
applications I would say of artificial intelligence to me is
autonomous driving, the semi-autonomous driving. And that's a really
good example of machine learning because those systems are constantly
learning. And there's a process there that maybe I can comment on,
the, Andrej Karpathy who's the head of autopilot calls it the data
engine. And this process applies for a lot of machine learning, which
is you build a system that's pretty good at doing stuff, you send it
out into the real world, it starts doing the stuff and then it runs
into what are called edge cases, like failure cases, where it screws
up. We do this as kids. That you have You do this as adults. We do
this as adults. Exactly. But we learn really quickly. But the whole
point, and this is the fascinating thing about driving, is you realize
there's millions of edge cases. There's just like weird situations
that you did not expect. And so the data engine process is you collect
those edge cases, and then you go back to the drawing board and learn
from them. And so you have to create this data pipeline where all
these cars, hundreds of thousands of cars are driving around and
something weird happens. And so whenever this weird detector fires,
it's another important concept, that piece of data goes back to the
mothership for the training, for the retraining of the system. And
through this data engine process, it keeps improving and getting
better and better and better and better. So basically you send out a
pretty clever AI systems out into the world and let it find the edge
cases, let it screw up just enough to figure out where the edge cases
are, and then go back and learn from them, and then send out that new
version and keep updating that version. Is the updating done by
humans? The annotation is done by humans. The, so you have to, the
weird examples come back, the edge cases, and you have to label what
actually happened in there. There's also some mechanisms for
automatically labeling, but mostly, I think you always have to rely on
humans to improve, to understand what's happening in the weird cases.
And then there's a lot of debate. And this, the other thing, what is
artificial intelligence? Which is a bunch of smart people having very
different opinions about what is intelligence. So AI is basically a
community of people who don't agree on anything. And it seems to be
the case. First of all, this is a beautiful description of terms that
I've heard many times among my colleagues at Stanford, at meetings in
the outside world. And there are so many fascinating things. I have so
many questions, but I do want to ask one question about the culture of
AI, because it does seem to be a community where at least as an
outsider, where it seems like there's very little consensus about what
the terms and the operational definitions even mean. And there seems
to be a lot of splitting happening now of not just supervised and
unsupervised learning, but these sort of intermediate conditions where
machines are autonomous, but then go back for more instruction like
kids go home from college during the summer and get a little, moms
still feeds them then eventually they leave the nest kind of thing. Is
there something in particular about engineers, or about people in this
realm of engineering that you think lends itself to disagreement?
Yeah, I think, so, first of all, the more specific you get, the less
disagreement there is. So there's lot of disagreement about what is
artificial intelligence, but there's less disagreement about what is
machine learning and even less when you talk about active learning or
machine teaching or self-supervised learning. And then when you get
into like NLP language models or transformers, when you get into
specific neural network architectures, there's less and less and less
disagreement about those terms. So you might be hearing the
disagreement from the high-level terms, and that has to do with the
fact that engineering, especially when you're talking about
intelligence systems is a little bit of an art and a science. So the
art part is the thing that creates disagreements, because then you
start having disagreements about how easy or difficult the particular
problem is. For example, a lot of people disagree with Elon how
difficult the problem of autonomous driving is. And so, but nobody
knows. So there's a lot of disagreement about, what are the limits of
these techniques? And through that, the terminology also contains
within it the disagreements. But overall, I think it's also a young
science that also has to do with that. So like it's not just
engineering, it's that artificial intelligence truly is a large-scale
discipline, where it's thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of
thousands of people working on it, huge amounts of money being made as
a very recent thing. So we're trying to figure out those terms. And,
of course, there's egos and personalities and a lot of fame to be
made. Like the term deep learning, for example, neural networks have
been around for many, many decades since the '60s, you can argue since
the '40s. So there was a rebranding of neural networks into the word,
deep learning, term, deep learning, that was part of the re-
invigoration of the field, but it's really the same exact thing. I
didn't know that. I mean, I grew up in the age of neuroscience when
neural networks were discussed, computational neuroscience and
theoretical neuroscience, they had their own journals. It wasn't
actually taken terribly seriously by experimentalists until a few
years ago. I would say about five to seven years ago. Excellent
theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott and other colleagues,
certainly at Stanford as well that people started paying attention to
computational methods. But these terms, neural networks, computational
methods, I actually didn't know that neural network works in deep
learning where those have now become kind of synonymous. No, they're
always the same thing. Interesting. It was, so. I'm a neuroscientist
and I didn't know that. So, well, because neural networks probably
means something else and neural science not something else, but a
little different flavor depending on the field. And that's fascinating
too, because neuroscience and AI people have started working together
and dancing a lot more in the recent, I would say probably decade. Oh,
machines are going into the brain. I have a couple of questions,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=1606"&gt;Machine &amp;amp; Human Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but one thing that I'm sort of fixated on that I find incredibly
interesting is this example you gave of playing a game with a mutated
version of yourself as a competitor. Yeah. I find that incredibly
interesting as a kind of a parallel or a mirror for what happens when
we try and learn as humans, which is we generate repetitions of
whatever it is we're trying to learn, and we make errors. Occasionally
we succeed. In a simple example, for instance, of trying to throw
bulls eyes on a dartboard. Yeah. I'm going to have errors, errors,
errors. I'll probably miss the dartboard. And maybe occasionally, hit
a bullseye. And I don't know exactly what I just did, right? But then
let's say I was playing darts against a version of myself where I was
wearing a visual prism, like my visual, I had a visual defect, you
learn certain things in that mode as well. You're saying that a
machine can sort of mutate itself, does the mutation always cause a
deficiency that it needs to overcome? Because of mutations in biology
sometimes give us super powers, right? Occasionally, you'll get
somebody who has better than 2020 vision, and they can see better than
99.9% of people out there. So, when you talk about a machine playing a
game against a mutated version of itself, is the mutation always say
what we call a negative mutation, or an adaptive or a maladaptive
mutation? No, you don't know until you get, so, you mutate first and
then figure out and they compete against each other. So, you're
evolving, the machine gets to evolve itself in real time. Yeah. And I
think of it, which would be exciting if you could actually do with
humans. It's not just. So, usually you freeze a version of the system.
So, really you take on Andrew of yesterday and you make 10 clones of
them. And then maybe you mutate, maybe not. And then you do a bunch of
competitions of the Andrew of today, like you fight to the death, and
who wins last. So, I love that idea of like creating a bunch of clones
of myself from like from each of the day for the past year, and just
seeing who's going to be better at like podcasting or science, or
picking up chicks at a bar or I don't know, or competing in Jujitsu.
That's the one way to do it, I mean, a lot of Lexes would have to die
for that process, but that's essentially what happens, is in
reinforcement learning through the self-play mechanisms, it's a
graveyard of systems that didn't do that well. And the surviving, the
good ones survive. Do you think that, I mean, Darwin's Theory of
Evolution might have worked in some sense in this way, but at the
population level. I mean, you get a bunch of birds with different
shaped beaks and some birds have the shaped beak that allows them to
get the seeds. I mean, is a trivially simple example of Darwinian in
evolution, but I think it's correct even though it's not exhaustive.
Is what you're referring to? You essentially that normally this is
done between members of a different species, lots of different members
of species have different traits and some get selected for, but you
could actually create multiple versions of yourself with different
traits. So, with, I should probably have said this, but perhaps it's
implied with machine learning, with reinforcement learning through
these processes. One of the big requirements, is to have an objective
function, a loss function, a utility function, those are all different
terms for the same thing, is there's a like any equation that says
what's good, and then you're trying to optimize that equation. So,
there's a clear goal for these systems. Because it's a game, like with
chess, there's a goal. But for anything. Anything you want machine
learning to solve, there needs to be an objective function. In machine
learning, it's usually called Loss Function, that you're optimizing.
The interesting thing about evolution, it's complicated of course, but
the goal also seems to be evolving. Like it's a, I guess, adaptation
to the environment, is the goal, but it's unclear that you can convert
that always. It's like survival of the fittest. It's unclear what the
fittest is. In machine learning, the starting point, and this is like
what human ingenuity provides, is that fitness function of what's good
and what's bad, which it lets you know which of the systems is going
to win. So, you need to have a equation like that. One of the
fascinating things about humans, is we figure out objective functions
for ourselves. Like it's the meaning of life, like why the hell are we
here? And a machine currently has to have a hard-coded statement about
why. It has to have a meaning of Yeah. Artificial intelligence-based
life. Right. It can't. So, like there's a lot of interesting
explorations about that function being more about curiosity, about
learning new things and all that kind of stuff, but it's still hard
coded. If you want a machine to be able to be good at stuff, it has to
be given very clear statements of what good at stuff means. That's one
of the challenges of artificial intelligence, is you have to formalize
the, in order to solve a problem, you have to formalize it and you
have to provide both like the full sensory information, you have to be
very clear about what is the data that's being collected, and you have
to also be clear about the objective function. What is the goal that
you're trying to reach? And that's a very difficult thing for
artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=1941"&gt;Curiosity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that you mentioned curiosity, I am sure this definition falls
short in many ways, but I define curiosity as a strong interest in
knowing something, but without an attachment to the outcome. It's sort
of a, it could be a random search, but there's not really an emotional
attachment, it's really just a desire to discover and unveil what's
there without hoping it's a gold coin under a rock, you're just
looking under rocks. Is that more or less how the, within machine
learning, it sounds like there are elements of reward prediction and
rewards. The machine has to know when it's done the right thing. So,
can you make machines that are curious, or are the sorts of machines
that you are describing, curious by design? Yeah, curiosity is a kind
of a symptom, not the goal. So, what happens, is one of the big trade-
offs in reinforcement learning, is this exploration versus
exploitation. So, when you know very little, it pays off to explore a
lot, even suboptimal, like even trajectories that seem like they're
not going to lead anywhere, that's called exploration. The smarter and
smarter and smarter you get, the more emphasis you put on
exploitation, meaning you take the best solution, you take the best
path. Now, through that process, the exploration can look like
curiosity by us humans, but it's really just trying to get out of the
local optimal, the thing it's already discovered. From an AI
perspective, it's always looking to optimize the objective function,
it derives, and we can talk about the slot more, but in terms of the
tools of machine learning today, it derives no pleasure from just the
curiosity of like, I don't know, discovery. So, there's no dopamine
for machine learning. - There's no dopamine. There's no reward, system
chemical, or I guess electronic-reward system. That said, if you look
at machine learning literature and reinforcement learning literature,
that will use, like deep mind, we use terms like dopamine, we're
constantly trying to use the human brain to inspire totally new
solutions to these problems. So, they'll think like, how does dopamine
function in the human brain, and how can it lead to more interesting
ways to discover optimal solutions? But ultimately currently, there
has to be a formal objective function. Now, you could argue the humans
also has a set of objective functions we try and optimize, we're just
not able to introspect them. Yeah, we don't actually know what we're
looking for and seeking and doing. Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett who
we spoken with at least on Instagram, I hope you I met her through
you, yeah. Yeah, I hope you actually have are on this podcast. Yes,
she's terrific. So, she has a very, it has to do with homeostasis like
that. Basically, there's a very dumb objective function that the brain
is trying to optimize, like to keep like body temperature the same.
Like there's a very dom kind of optimization function happening. And
then what we humans do with our fancy consciousness and cognitive
abilities, is we tell stories to ourselves so we can have nice
podcasts, but really it's the brain trying to maintain a, just like
healthy state, I guess. That's fascinating. I also see the human
brain, and I hope artificial intelligence systems, as not just systems
that solve problems, or optimize a goal, but are also storytellers. I
think there's a power to telling stories. We tell stories to each
other, that's what communication is. Like when you're alone, that's
when you solve problems, that's when it makes sense to talk about
solving problems. But when you're a community, the capability to
communicate, tell stories, share ideas in such a way that those ideas
are stable over a long period of time, that's like, that's being a
charismatic storyteller. And I think both humans are very good at
this. Arguably, I would argue that's why we are who we are, is we're
great storytellers. And then AI I hope will also become that. So, it's
not just about being able to solve problems with a clear objective
function, it's afterwards, be able to tell like a way better, like
make up a way better story about why you did something, or why you
failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=2215"&gt;Story Telling Robots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you think that robots or, and/or machines of some sort are going
to start telling human stories? Well, definitely. So, the technical
field for that is called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial
Intelligence, is trying to figure out how you get the AI system to
explain to us humans why the hell it failed, or why it succeeded, or
there's a lot of different sort of versions of this, or to visualize
how it understands the world. That's a really difficult problem,
especially with neural networks that are famously opaque, that we
don't understand in many cases, why a particular neural network does
what it does so well, and to try to figure out where it's going to
fail, that requires the AI to explain itself. There's a huge amount of
money, like there's a huge amount of money in this, especially from
government funding and so on. Because if you want to deploy AI systems
in the real world, we humans at least, want to ask it a question like,
why the hell did you do that? Like in a dark way, why did you just
kill that person, right? Like if a car ran over a person, we want to
understand why that happened. And now again, we're sometimes very
unfair to AI systems because we humans can often not explain why very
well. But that's the field of Explainable AI that people are very
interested in because the more and more we rely on AI systems, like
the Twitter recommender system, that AI algorithm that's, I would say
impacting elections, perhaps starting wars, or at least military
conflict, that algorithm, we want to ask that algorithm, first of all,
do you know what the hell you're doing? Do you understand the society-
level effects you're having? And can you explain the possible other
trajectories? Like we would have that kind of conversation with a
human, we want to be able to do that with an AI. And in my own
personal level, I think it would be nice to talk to AI systems for
stupid stuff, like robots when they fail to Why'd you fall down the
stairs? Yeah. But not an engineering question, but almost like an
endearing question, like I'm looking for, if I fell and you and I were
hanging out, I don't think you need an explanation exactly what were
the dynamics, like what was the under actuated system problem here?
Like what was the texture of the floor? Or so on. Or like, what was
the No, I want to know what you're thinking. That, or you might joke
about like, you're drunk again, go home, or something, like there
could be humor in it, that's an opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't
just explanation of what happened, it's something that makes people
laugh, it makes people fall in love, it makes people dream, and
understand things in a way that poetry makes people understand things
as opposed to a rigorous log of where every sensor was, where every
actuator was. I mean, I find this incredible because one of the
hallmarks of severe autism spectrum disorders is, a report of
experience from the autistic person that is very much a catalog of
action steps. It's like, how do you feel today? And they'll say, well,
I got up and I did this, and then I did this, and I did this. And it's
not at all the way that a person who doesn't have autism spectrum
disorder would respond. And the way you describe these machines has so
much humanism, or so much of a human and biological element, but I
realized that we were talking about machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=2448"&gt;What Defines a Robot?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make sure that I understand if there's a distinction between
a machine that learns, a machine with artificial intelligence and a
robot. Like at what point does a machine become a robot? So, if I have
a ballpoint pen, I'm assuming I wouldn't call that a robot, but if my
ballpoint pen can come to me when I moved to the opposite side of the
table, if it moves by whatever mechanism, at that point, does it
become a robot? Okay, there's 1 million ways to explore this question.
It's a fascinating one. So, first of all, there's a question of what
is life? Like how do you know something as a living form and not? And
it's to the question of when does sort of a, maybe a cold
computational system becomes a, or already loading these words with a
lot of meaning, robot and machine, So, one, I think movement is
important, but that's a kind of a boring idea that a robot is just a
machine that's able to act in the world. So, one artificial
intelligence could be both just the thinking thing, which I think is
what machine learning is, and also the acting thing, which is what we
usually think about robots. So, robots are the things that have a
perception system that's able to take in the world however you define
the world, is able to think and learn and do whatever the hell it does
inside, and then act on the world. So, that's the difference between
maybe an AI system learning machine and a robot, it's something that's
able, a robot is something that's able to perceive the world and act
in the world. So, it could be through language or sound, or it could
be through movement or both. Yeah. And I think it could also be in the
digital space as long as there's a aspect of entity that's inside the
machine and a world that's outside the machine. And there's a sense in
which the machine is sensing that world and acting in it. So, we
could, for instance, there could be a version of a robot, according to
the definition that I think you're providing, where the robot, where I
go to sleep at night and this robot goes and forges for information
that it thinks I want to see loaded onto my desktop in the morning.
There was no movement of that machine, there was no language, but it
essentially, has movement in cyberspace. Yeah, there's a distinction
that I think is important in that there's an element of it being an
entity, whether it's in the digital or the physical space. So, when
you have something like Alexa in your home, most of the speech
recognition, most of what Alexa is doing, is constantly being sent
back to the mothership. When Alexa is there on its own, that's to me,
a robot, when it's there interacting with the world. When it's simply
a finger of the main mothership, then the Alexa is not a robot, then
it's just an interaction device, then may be the main Amazon Alexa AI,
big, big system is the robot. So, that's important because there's
some element, to us humans, I think, where we want there to be an
entity, whether in the digital or the physical space, that's where
ideas of consciousness come in and all those kinds of things that we
project our understanding of what it means to be a being. And so, to
take that further, when does a machine become a robot, I think there's
a special moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=2670"&gt;Magic &amp;amp; Surprise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a special moment in a person's life and in a robot's life
where it surprises you. I think surprise is a really powerful thing,
where you know how the thing works and yet it surprises you, that's a
magical moment for us humans. So, whether it's a chess-playing program
that does something that you haven't seen before, that makes people
smile like, huh, those moments happen with AlphaZero for the first
time in chess playing, where grand masters were really surprised by a
move. They didn't understand the move and then they studied and
studied and then they understood it. But that moment of surprise,
that's for grandmasters in chess. I find that moment of surprise
really powerful, really magical in just everyday life. Because it
supersedes the human brain in that moment? So, it's not supersedes,
like outperforms, but surprises you in a positive sense. Like I didn't
think he could do that, I didn't think that you had that in you. And I
think that moment is a big transition for a robot from a moment of
being a servant that accomplishes a particular task with some level of
accuracy, with some rate of failure, to an entity, a being that's
struggling just like you are in this world. And that's a really
important moment that I think you're not going to find many people in
the AI community that talk like I just did. I'm not speaking like some
philosopher or some hippie, I'm speaking from purely engineering
perspective. I think it's really important for robots to become
entities and explore that as a real engineering problem, as opposed to
everybody treats robots in the robotics community, they don't even
call them or he or she, they don't give them, try to avoid giving them
names, they've really want to see like a system, like a servant. They
see it as a servant that's trying to accomplish a task. To me, and
don't think I'm just romanticizing the notion, I think it's a being,
it's a currently perhaps a dumb being, but in the long arc of history,
humans are pretty dumb beings too, so I would agree with that
statement. [Andrew laughing] So, I tend to really want to explore this
treating robots really as entities, yeah. So, like
anthropomorphization, which is the sort of the act of looking at a
inanimate object and projecting onto it life-like features, I think
robotics generally sees that as a negative, I see it as a superpower.
Like that, we need to use that. Well, I'm struck by how that really
grabs onto the relationship between human and machine, or human and
robot. So, I guess the simple question is, and I think you've already
told us the answer, but does interacting with a robot change you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=2857"&gt;How Robots Change Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, do we develop relationships to robots? Yeah, I
definitely think so. I think the moment you see a robot or AI systems
as more than just servants but entities, they begin to change you, in
just like good friends do, just like relationships just to other
humans. I think for that, you have to have certain aspects of that
interaction. Like the robot's ability to say no, to have its own sense
of identity, to have its own set of goals, that's not constantly
serving you, but instead, trying to understand the world and do that
dance of understanding through communication with you. So, I
definitely think there's a, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts about
this as you may know, and that's at the core of my life-long dream
actually of what I want to do, which is I believe that most people
have a notion of loneliness in them that we haven't discovered, that
we haven't explored, I should say. And I see AI systems as helping us
explore that so that we can become better humans, better people
towards each other. So, I think that connection between human and AI,
human and robot, is not only possible, but will help us understand
ourselves in ways that are like several orders of magnitude deeper
than we ever could have imagined. I tend to believe that [sighing]
well, I have very wild levels of belief in terms of how impactful that
will be, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=2975"&gt;Relationships Defined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I think about human relationships, I don't always break them
down into variables, but we could explore a few of those variables and
see how they map to human-robot relationships. One is just time,
right? If you spend zero time with another person at all in cyberspace
or on the phone or in person, you essentially have no relationship to
them. If you spend a lot of time, you have a relationship, this is
obvious. But I guess one variable would be time, how much time you
spend with the other entity, robot or human. The other would be wins
and successes. You enjoy successes together. I'll give a absolutely
trivial example this in a moment, but the other would be failures.
When you struggle with somebody, whether or not you struggle between
one another, you disagree, like I was really struck by the fact that
you said that robot saying no, I've never thought about a robot saying
no to me, but there it is. I look forward to you being one of the
first people I send this robots to. So do I. So, there's struggle.
When you struggle with somebody, you grow closer. Sometimes the
struggles are imposed between those two people, so called trauma
bonding, they call it in the whole psychology literature and pop
psychology literature. But in any case, I can imagine. So, time
successes together, struggle together, and then just peaceful time,
hanging out at home, watching movies, waking up near one another,
here, we're breaking down the elements of relationships of any kind.
So, do you think that these elements apply to robot-human
relationships? And if so, then I could see how, if the robot has its
own entity and has some autonomy in terms of how it reacts you, it's
not just there just to serve you, it's not just a servant, it actually
has opinions, and can tell you when maybe your thinking is flawed, or
your actions are flawed. It can also leave. It could also leave. So,
I've never conceptualized robot-human interactions this way. So, tell
me more about how this might look. Are we thinking about a human-
appearing robot? I know you and I have both had intense relationships
to our, we have separate dogs obviously, but to animals, it sounds a
lot like human-animal interaction. So, what is the ideal human-robot
relationship? So, there's a lot to be said here, but you actually
pinpointed one of the big, big first steps, which is this idea of
time. And it's a huge limitation in machine-learning community
currently. Now we're back to like the actual details. Life-long
learning is a problem space that focuses on how AI systems can learn
over a long period of time. What's currently most machine learning
systems are not able to do, is to all of the things you've listed
under time, the successes, the failures, or just chilling together
watching movies, AI systems are not able to do that, which is all the
beautiful, magical moments that I believe are the days filled with,
they're not able to keep track of those together with you. 'Cause they
can't move with you and be with you. No, no, like literally we don't
have the techniques to do the learning, the actual learning of
containing those moments. Current machine-learning systems are really
focused on understanding the world in the following way, it's more
like the perception system, like looking around, understand like
what's in the scene. That there's a bunch of people sitting down, that
there is cameras and microphones, that there's a table, understand
that. But the fact that we shared this moment of talking today, and
still remember that for like next time you're doing something,
remember that this moment happened. We don't know how to do that
technique-wise. This is what I'm hoping to innovate on as I think it's
a very, very important component of what it means to create a deeper
relationship, that sharing of moments together. Could you post a photo
of you in the robot, like selfie with robot and the robot sees that
image and recognizes that was time spent, there were smiles, or there
were tears Yeah. And create some sort of metric of emotional depth in
the relationship and update its behavior? So. Could it... It texts you
in the middle of the night and say, why haven't you texted me back?
Well, yes, all of those things, but we can dig into that. But I think
that time element, forget everything else, just sharing moments
together, that changes everything. I believe that changes everything.
Now, there's specific things that are more in terms of systems that I
can explain you. It's more technical and probably a little bit
offline, 'cause I have kind of wild ideas how that can revolutionize
social networks and operating systems. But the point is that element
alone, forget all the other things we're talking about like emotions,
saying no, all that, just remembering sharing moments together would
change everything. We don't currently have systems that share moments
together. Like even just you and your fridge, just all those times,
you went late at night and ate thing you shouldn't have eaten, that
was a secret moment you have with your refrigerator. You shared that
moment, that darkness or that beautiful moment where you were just
like heartbroken for some reason, you're eating that ice cream or
whatever, that's a special moment. And that refrigerator was there for
you, and the fact that it missed the opportunity to remember that is
tragic. And once it does remember that, I think you're going to be
very attached to the refrigerator. You're going to go through some
hell with that refrigerator. Most of us have, like in the developed
world, have weird relationships with food, right? So, you can go
through some deep moments of trauma and triumph with food, and at the
core of that, is the refrigerator. So, a smart refrigerator, I believe
would change society. Not just the refrigerator, but these ideas in
the systems all around us. So, I just want to comment on how powerful
that idea of time is. And then there's a bunch of elements of actual
interaction of allowing you as a human to feel like you're being
heard. Truly heard, truly understood, that we human, like deep
friendship is like that, I think, but there's still an element of
selfishness, there's still an element of not really being able to
understand another human. And a lot of the times when you're going
through trauma together, through difficult times and through
successes, you actually starting to get that inkling of understanding
of each other, but I think that could be done more aggressively, more
efficiently. Like if you think of a great therapist, I think I've
never actually been to a therapist, but I'm a believer I used to want
to be a psychiatrist. Do Russians go to therapists? No, they don't.
They don't. And if they do, the therapist don't live to tell the
story. I do believe in talk therapy, which friendship is to me, is
it's talk therapy, or like you don't even necessarily need to talk
[laughing] it's like just connecting through in the space of ideas and
the space of experiences. And I think there's a lot of ideas of how to
make AI systems to be able to ask the right questions and truly hear
another human. This is what we try to do with podcasting, right? I
think there's ways to do that with AI. But above all else, just
remembering the collection of moments that make up the day, the week,
the months, I think you maybe have some of this as well. Some of my
closest friends still are the friends from high school. That's time,
we've been through a bunch of together, and that like we're very
different people. But just the fact that we've been through that, and
we remember those moments, and those moments somehow create a depth of
connection like nothing else, like you and your refrigerator. I love
that because my graduate advisor, she unfortunately, she passed away,
but when she passed away, somebody said at her at her memorial all
these amazing things she had done, et cetera. And then her kids got up
there, and she had young children and that I knew as when she was
pregnant with them. And so, it was really, you're even now I can feel
like your heart gets heavy, thinking about this, they're going to grow
up without their mother. And it was really amazing, very strong young
girls, and now the young women. And what they said was incredible,
they said what they really appreciated most about their mother, who
was an amazing person, is all the unstructured time they spent
together. Mm-hmm. So, it wasn't the trips to the zoo, it wasn't she
woke up at five in the morning and drove us to school. She did all
those things too. She had two hour commute in each direction, it was
incredible, ran a lab, et cetera, but it was the unstructured time.
So, on the passing of their mother, that's what they remembered was
that the biggest give and what bonded them to her, was all the time
where they just kind of hung out. And the way you describe the
relationship to a refrigerator is so, I want to say human-like, but
I'm almost reluctant to say that. Because what I'm realizing as we're
talking, is that what we think of as human-like might actually be the
lower form of relationship. There may be relationships that are far
better than the sorts of relationships that we can conceive in our
minds right now based on what these machine relationship interactions
could teach us. Do I have that right? Yeah, I think so. I think
there's no reason to see machines as somehow incapable of teaching us
something that's deeply human. I don't think humans have a monopoly on
that. I think we understand ourselves very poorly and we need to have
the kind of prompting from a machine. And definitely part of that, is
just remembering the moments. I think the unstructured time together,
I wonder if it's quite so unstructured. That's like calling this
podcast on structured time. Maybe what they meant, was it wasn't a big
outing, there was no specific goal, but a goal was created through the
lack of a goal. Like we would just hang out and then you start
playing, thumb war, and you end up playing thumb war for an hour. So,
it's the structure emerges from lack of structure. No, but the thing
is the moments, there's something about those times that creates
special moments, and I think those could be optimized for. I think we
think of like a big outing as, I don't know, going to Six Flags or
something, or some big, the Grand Canyon, or go into some, I don't
know, I think we would need to, we don't quite yet understand, as
humans, what creates magical moments. I think it's possible to
optimize a lot of those things. And perhaps like podcasting is helping
people discover that, like maybe the thing we want to optimize for
isn't necessarily like some sexy, like quick clips, maybe what we
want, is long-form authenticity. Depth. Depth. So, we were trying to
figure that out, certainly from a deep connection between humans and
humans and NAS systems, I think long conversations, or long periods of
communication over a series of moments like my new, perhaps, seemingly
insignificant to the big ones, the big successes, the big failures,
those are all just stitching those together and talking throughout. I
think that's the formula for a really, really deep connection. That
from like a very specific engineering perspective, is I think a
fascinating open problem that has been really worked on very much. And
for me, from a, if I have the guts and, I mean there's a lot of things
to say, but one of it is guts, is I'll build a startup around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=3749"&gt;Lex’s Dream for Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's talk about this startup and let's talk about the dream. You
mentioned this dream before in our previous conversations, always as
little hints dropped here and there. Just for anyone listening,
there's never been an offline conversation about this dream, I'm not
privy to anything, except what Lex says now. And I realized that
there's no way to capture the full essence of a dream in any kind of
verbal statement in a way that captures all of it. But what is this
dream that you've referred to now several times when we've sat down
together and talked on the phone? Maybe it's this company, maybe it's
something distinct. If you feel comfortable, it'd be great if you
could share a little bit about what that is. - Sure. So, the way
people express long-term vision, I've noticed is quite different. Like
Elon is an example of somebody who can very crisply say exactly what
the goal is. Also has to do with the fact that problems he's solving
have nothing to do with humans. So, my long-term vision is a little
bit more difficult to express in words, I've noticed, as I've tried,
it could be my brain's failure, but there's a way to sneak up to it.
So, let me just say a few things. Early on in life and also in the
recent years, I've interacted with a few robots where I understood
there's magic there. And that magic could be shared by millions if
it's brought to light. When I first met Spot from Boston Dynamics, I
realized there's magic there that nobody else is seeing. Is the dog.
The dog, sorry. The Spot is the four-legged robot from Boston
Dynamics. Some people might have seen it, it's this yellow dog. And
sometimes in life, you just notice something that just grabs you. And
I believe that this is something that this magic is something that
could be in every single device in the world. The way that I think
maybe Steve Jobs thought about the personal computer, laws didn't
think about the personal computer this way, but Steve did. Which is
like, he thought that the personal computer should be as thin as a
sheet of paper and everybody should have one, and this idea, I think
it is heartbreaking that we're getting, the world is being filled up
with machines that are soulless. And I think every one of them can
have that same magic. One of the things that also inspired me in terms
of a startup, is that magic can engineered much easier than I thought.
That's my intuition with everything I've ever built and worked on. So,
the dream is to add a bit of that magic in every single computing
system in the world. So, the way that Windows Operating System for a
long time was the primary operating system everybody interacted with,
they built apps on top of it. I think this is something that should be
as a layer, it's almost as an operating system in every device that
humans interacted with in the world. Now, what that actually looks
like, the actual dream when I was officially a kid, it didn't have
this concrete form of a business, it had more of a dream of exploring
your own loneliness by interacting with machines, robots. This deep
connection between humans and robots was always a dream. And so, for
me, I'd love to see a world where there's every home as a robot, and
not a robot that washes the dishes, or a sex robot, or I don't know,
think of any kind of activity the robot can do, but more like a
companion. A family member. A family member, the way a dog is. Mm-hmm.
But a dog that's able to speak your language too. So, not just connect
the way a dog does by looking at you and looking away and almost like
smiling with its soul in that kind of way, but also to actually
understand what the hell, like, why are you so excited about the
successes? Like understand the details, understand the traumas. And
that, I just think [sighing] that has always filled me with excitement
that I could, with artificial intelligence, bring joy to a lot of
people. More recently, I've been more and more heartbroken to see the
kind of division, derision, even hate that's boiling up on the
internet through social networks. And I thought this kind of mechanism
is exactly applicable in the context of social networks as well. So,
it's an operating system that serves as your guide on the internet.
One of the biggest problems with YouTube and social networks
currently, is they're optimizing for engagement. I think if you create
AI systems that know each individual person, you're able to optimize
for long-term growth for a long-term happiness. Of the individual, or
Of the individual, of the individual. And there's a lot of other
things to say, which is in order for AI systems to learn everything
about you, they need to collect, they need to just like you and I when
we talk offline, we're collecting data about each others secrets about
each other, the same way AI has to do that. And that allows you to,
and that requires you to rethink ideas of ownership of data. I think
each individual should own all of their data and very easily be able
to leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear and
delete all of their data in a moment's notice. Which is actually
better than we humans can do, is once we load the data into each
other, it's there. I think it's very important to be both, give people
complete control over their data in order to establish trust that they
can trust you. And the second part of trust is transparency. Whenever
the data is used to make it very clear what is being used for. And not
clear in a lawyerly legal sense, but clear in a way that people really
understand what it's used for. I believe when people have the ability
to delete all their data and walk away and know how the data is being
used, I think they'll stay. The possibility of a clean breakup, is
actually what will keep people together. Yeah, I think so. I think,
exactly. I think a happy marriage acquires the ability to divorce
easily without the divorce industrial complex or whatever. Things
currently going on and then there's so much money to be made from
lawyers and divorce. But yeah, the ability to leave is what enables
love, I think. It's interesting. I've heard the phrase from a semi-
cynical friend, that marriage is the leading cause of divorce, but now
we've heard that divorce, or the possibility of divorce could be the
leading cause of marriage. Of a happy marriage. Good point. Of a happy
marriage. So, yeah. So, there's a lot of details there, but the big
dream is that connection between AI system and a human. And I haven't.
There's so much fear about artificial intelligence systems and about
robots that I haven't quite found the right words to express that
vision because the vision I have, it's not like some naive, delusional
vision of like technology is going to save everybody, it's I really do
just have a positive view of ways AI systems can help humans explore
themselves. I love that positivity and I agree that the stance
everything is doomed is equally bad to say that everything's going to
turn out all right, there has to be a dedicated effort. And clearly,
you're thinking about what that dedicated effort would look like. You
mentioned two aspects to this dream [clears throat] and I want to make
sure that I understand where they connect if they do, or if they are
independent streams. One was this hypothetical robot family member, or
some other form of robot that would allow people to experience the
kind of delight that you experienced many times, and that you would
like the world to be able to have, and it's such a beautiful idea of
this give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=4293"&gt;Improving Social Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the other is social media or social network platforms that really
serve individuals and their best selves and their happiness and their
growth. Is there crossover between those, or are these two parallel
dreams? It's 100% of the same thing. It's difficult to kind of explain
without going through details, but maybe one easy way to explain the
way I think about social networks, is to create an AI system that's
yours. It's not like Amazon Alexa that's centralized, you own the
data, it's like your little friend that becomes your representative on
Twitter that helps you find things that will make you feel good, that
will also challenge your thinking to make you grow, but not get to
that, not let you get lost in the negative spiral of dopamine, that
gets you to be angry, or most just get you to be not open to learning.
And so, that little representative is optimizing your long-term
health. And I believe that that is not only good for human beings,
it's also good for business. I think longterm, you can make a lot of
money by challenging this idea that the only way to make money, is
maximizing engagement. And one of the things that people disagree with
me on, is they think Twitter's always going to win. Like maximizing
engagement is always going to win, I don't think so. I think people
have woken up now to understanding that, like they don't always feel
good, the ones who are on Twitter a lot, that they don't always feel
good at the end of the week. I would love feedback from whatever this
creature, whatever, I don't know what to call it, as to maybe at the
end of the week, it would automatically unfollow some of the people
that I follow because it realized through some really smart data about
how I was feeling inside, or how I was sleeping, or something that, I
don't know, that just wasn't good for me. But it might also put things
and people in front of me that I ought to see, is that kind of a
sliver of what this look like? The whole point, because of the
interaction, because of sharing the moments and learning a lot about
you, you're now able to understand what interactions led you to become
a better version of yourself. Like the person you yourself are happy
with. This isn't, if you're into flat earth and you feel very good
about it, that you believe that earth is flat, like the idea that you
should sensor that is ridiculous. If it makes you feel good and you
becoming the best version of yourself, I think you should be getting
as much flat earth as possible. Now, it's also good to challenge your
ideas, but not because the centralized committee decided, but because
you tell to the system that you like challenging your ideas, I think
all of us do. And then, which actually YouTube doesn't do that well,
once you go down the flat-earth rabbit hole, that's all you're going
to see. It's nice to get some really powerful communicators to argue
against flat earth. And it's nice to see that for you, and
potentially, at least long-term to expand your horizons, maybe the
earth is not flat. But if you continue to live your whole life
thinking the earth is flat, I think, and you're being a good father or
son or daughter, and like you're being the best version of yourself
and you're happy with yourself, I think the earth is flat. So, like I
think this kind of idea, and I'm just using that kind of silly,
ridiculous example because I don't like the idea of centralized forces
controlling what you can and can't see, but I also don't like this
idea of like not censoring anything. Because that's always the biggest
problem with that, is this there's a central decider, I think you
yourself can decide what you want to see and not, and it's good to
have a companion that reminds you that you felt last time you did
this, or you felt good last time you did this. Man, I feel like in
every good story, there's a guide or a companion that flies out, or
forges a little bit further, a little bit differently and brings back
information that helps us, or at least tries to steer us in the right
direction. So, yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking and what I've
been working on. I should mention as a bunch of difficulties here, you
see me up and down a little bit recently. So, there's technically a
lot of challenges here. Just like with a lot of technologies, and the
reason I'm talking about it on a podcast comfortably as opposed to
working in secret, is it's really hard and maybe it's time has not
come. And that's something you have to constantly struggle with in
terms of like entrepreneurially as a startup, like I've also mentioned
to you, maybe offline, I really don't care about money, I don't care
about business success, all those kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=4617"&gt;Challenges of Creativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's a difficult decision to make, how much of your time do you
want to go all in here and give everything to this? It's a big roll
the dice. Because I've also realized that's working on some of these
problems, both with the robotics and the technical side in terms of
the machine-learning system that I'm describing, it's lonely, it's
really lonely. Because both on a personal level and a technical level.
So, on the technical level, I'm surrounded by people that kind of
doubt me, which I think all entrepreneurs go through. And they doubt
you in the following sense, they know how difficult it is. Like the
people that the colleagues of mine, they know how difficult life-long
learning is, they also know how difficult it is to build a system like
this, to build the competitive social network. And in general, there's
a kind of a loneliness to just working on something on your own for
long periods of time. And you start to doubt whether, given that you
don't have a track record of success, like that's a big one. But when
you look in the mirror, especially when you're young, but I still have
that, I'm most things, you look in the mirror, it's like, and you have
these big dreams, how do you know you're actually as smart as you
think you are? Like how do you know you're going to be able to
accomplish this dream? You have this ambition. You sort of don't, but
you're kind of pulling on a string hoping that there's a bigger ball
of yarn. Yeah. [Andrew laughing] But you have this kind of intuition.
I think I pride myself in knowing what I'm good at, because the reason
I have that intuition, is 'cause I think I'm very good at knowing all
the things I suck at, which is basically everything. So, like whenever
I notice like, wait a minute, I'm kind of good at this, which is very
rare for me. I think like that, that might be a ball of yarn worth
pulling at. And the thing with in terms of engineering systems that
are able to interact with humans, I think I'm very good at that. And
because we talk about podcasting and so on, I don't know if I'm very
good at podcasts. You're very good at podcasting, right? But I
certainly don't, I think maybe it is compelling for people to watch a
kindhearted idiot struggle with this form, maybe that's what's
compelling. But in terms of like actual being a good engineer of
human-robot interaction systems, I think I'm good. But it's hard to
know until you do it, and then the world keeps telling you you're not,
and it's full of doll, it's really hard. And I've been struggling with
that recently, it's kind of a fascinating struggle. But then that's
where the Goggins thing comes in, is like, aside from the state-hard
motherfucker, is the, like whenever you're struggling, that's a good
sign that if you keep going, that you're going to be alone in the
success, right? Well, in your case, however, I agree. And actually
David had a post recently that I thought was among his many brilliant
posts, was one of the more brilliant about how he talked about this
myth of the light at the end of the tunnel. And instead, what he
replaced that myth with, was a concept that eventually, your eyes
adapt to the dark. That the tunnel, it's not about a light at the end,
that it's really about adapting to the dark of the tunnel. It's very
Goggins I love him so much. Yeah. You got share a lot in common
knowing you both a bit, share a lot in common. But in this loneliness
and the pursuit of this dream, it seems to me, it has a certain
component to it that is extremely valuable, which is that the
loneliness itself could serve as a driver to build the companion for
the journey. Well, I'm very deeply aware of that. So, like some people
can make, 'cause I talk about love a lot, I really love everything in
this world, but I also love humans, friendship and romantic, like even
the cheesy stuff, just You like romantic movies? Yeah, not those, not
necessarily. So, well, I got so much from Rogan about like, was it the
Tango scene from "Scent of a Woman," but I find like there's nothing
better than a woman in a red dress, just like the classy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=4909"&gt;Suits &amp;amp; Dresses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should move to Argentina my friend. My father's Argentine, and you
know what he said when I went on your podcast for the first time? He
said, he dresses well. Because in Argentina, the men go to a wedding
or a party or something, in the U.S., by halfway through the night, 10
minutes in the night, all the jackets are off. Yeah. It looks like
everyone's undressing for the party they just got dressed up for. And
he said, you know, I liked the way he dresses. And then when I
started, he was talking about you. And then when I started my podcast,
he said, why don't you wear a real suit like your friend Lex?
[laughing] I remember that. No, you can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=4942"&gt;Loneliness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's talk about this pursuit just a bit more, because I think
what you're talking about, is building a, not just a solution for
loneliness, but you've alluded to the loneliness as itself, an
important thing. And I think you're right. I think within people,
there is like caverns of faults and shame, but also just the desire to
have resonance, to be seen and heard. And I don't even know that it's
seen and heard through language. But these reservoirs of loneliness, I
think, well, they're interesting, maybe you could comment a little bit
about it. Because just as often as you talk about love, I haven't
quantified it, but it seems that you talk about this loneliness, and
maybe you just if you're willing, you'll share a little bit more about
that, and what that feels like now in the pursuit of building this
robot-human relationship. And you've been, let me be direct, you've
been spending a lot of time on building a robot-human relationship,
where's that at? Oh, in terms of business, in terms of systems? No,
I'm talking about a specific robot. Oh [laughing] so, okay, I should
mention a few things. So, one, is there's a startup with an idea where
I hope millions of people can use. And then there's my own personal
like almost like Frankenstein explorations with particular robots. So,
I'm very fascinated with the legged robots in my own, private sounds
like dark, but like in of one experiments to see if I can recreate the
magic. And that's been, I have a lot of really good already perception
systems and control systems that are able to communicate affection in
a dog-like fashion. So, I'm in a really good place there. The
stumbling blocks, which also have been part of my sadness recently, is
that I also have to work with robotics companies that I gave so much
of my heart, soul and love and appreciation towards Boston Dynamics,
but Boston Dynamics has also, as a company, it has to make a lot of
money and they have marketing teams. And they're like looking at this
silly Russian kid in a suit and tie, it's like, what's he trying to do
with all this love and robot interaction and dancing and so on? So,
there was a, I think let's say for now, it's like, when you break up
with a girlfriend or something, right now, we decided to part ways on
this particular thing. They're huge supporters of mine, they're huge
fans, but on this particular thing, Boston Dynamics is not focusing
on, or interested in human-robot interaction. In fact, their whole
business currently, is keep the robot as far away from humans as
possible because it's an in the industrial setting where it's doing
monitoring in dangerous environments. It's almost like a remote
security camera, essentially is its application. To me, I thought it's
still, even in those applications, exceptionally useful for the robot
to be able to perceive humans, like see humans and to be able to, in a
big map, localize where those humans are and have human intention. For
example, like this, I did this a lot of work with pedestrians, for a
robot to be able to anticipate what the how the human is doing, like
where it's walking. The humans are not ballistics object, just because
you're walking this way one moment, it doesn't mean you'll keep
walking that direction, you have to infer a lot of signals, especially
with the head movement and the eye movement. And so, I thought that's
super interesting to explore, but they didn't feel that. So, I'll be
working with a few other robotics companies that are much more open to
that kind of stuff, and they're super excited and fans of mine. And
hopefully, Boston Dynamics, my first love, like getting back with an
ex-girlfriend, will come around. But so, the algorithmically, it's
basically a done there. The rest, is actually getting some of these
companies to work with. And then there's, for people who'd worked with
robots know that one thing is to write software that works, and the
other is to have a real machine that actually works. And it breaks
down all kinds of different ways that are fascinating. And so, there's
a big challenge there. But that's almost, it may sound a little bit
confusing in the context of our previous discussion because the
previous discussion was more about the big dream, how I hoped to have
millions of people enjoy this moment of magic. This current discussion
about a robot, is something I personally really enjoy, just brings me
happiness, I really try to do now everything that just brings me joy,
I maximize that 'cause robots are awesome. But two, given my like
little bit growing platform, I want to use the opportunity to educate
people. Like robots are cool. And if I think they're cool, I hope be
able to communicate why they're cool to others. So, this little robot
experiment is a little bit of research project too, there's a couple
of publications with MIT folks around that. But the other is just to
make some cool videos and explain to people how they actually work.
And as opposed to people being scared of robots, they could still be
scared, but also excited, like see the dark side, the beautiful side,
the magic of what it means to bring, for a machine to become a robot.
I want to inspire people with that. But that's less, it's interesting
because I think the big impact in terms of the dream does not have to
do with embodied AI. So, it does not need to have a body. I think the
refrigerator's enough, that for an AI system just to have a voice and
to hear you, that's enough for loneliness. The embodiment is just By
embodiment, you mean the physical structure. Physical instantiation of
intelligence. So, it's a legged robot, or even just a thing. I have a
few other of humanoid robot, a little humanoid robot maybe I'll keep
them on the table, is like walks around, or even just like a mobile
platform they can just like, turn around and look at you, it's like we
mentioned with the pen. Something that moves and can look at you, it's
like that Butter Robot that asks, what is my purpose? That is really,
it's almost like art. There's something about a physical entity that
moves around, that's able to look at you and interact with you, that
makes you wonder what it means to be human. It like challenges you to
think, if that thing looks like he has consciousness, what the hell am
I? And I like that feeling, I think that's really useful for us, it's
humbling for us humans. But that's less about research, it certainly
less about business and more about exploring our own selves, and
challenging others to think like, to think about what makes them
human. I love this desire to share the delight of an interaction with
a robot. And as you describe it, I actually find myself starting to
crave that because we all have those elements from childhood where, or
from adulthood, where we experience something, we want other people to
feel that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=5409"&gt;Empathy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that you're right, I think a lot of people are scared of
AI, I think a lot of people are scared of robots. My only experience,
and of a robotic-like thing is my Roomba Vacuum, where it goes about,
actually, it was pretty good at picking up Costello's hair when he was
shed and I was grateful for it. But then when I was on a call or
something, and it would get caught on a wire or something, I would
find myself getting upset with the Roomba in that moment, I'm like,
what are you doing? And obviously it's just doing what it does. But
that's a kind of mostly positive, but slightly negative interaction.
But what you're describing, it has so much more richness and layers of
detail that I can only imagine what those relationships are like.
Well, there's a few, just a quick comment. So, I've had, they're
currently in Boston and I have a bunch of Roombas from iRobot. And I
did this experiment Wait, how many Roombas? [Lex laughing] It sounds
like a fleet of Roombas. Yeah. So, it's probably seven or eight, yeah.
Well, it's a lot of Roombas. This place is very clean. Well, so, this,
I'm kind of waiting, this is the place we're currently in Austin, is
way larger than I need. But I basically got it to make sure I have
room for robots. So, you have these seven or so Roombas, you deploy
all seven at once? Oh, no, I do different experience with them,
different experiments with them. So, one of the things I want to
mention, is this is a, I think there was a YouTube video that inspired
me to try this, is I got them to scream in pain and moan in pain
whenever they were kicked or contacted. And I did that experiment to
see how I would feel. I meant to do like a YouTube video on it, but
then it just seemed very cruel. Did any Roomba rights activists come
at you? Like I think if I released that video, I think it's going to
make me look insane, which I know people know I'm already insane Now,
you have to release the video. [Lex laughing] Sure. Well, I think
maybe if I contextualize it by showing other robots like to show why
this is fascinating, because ultimately, I felt like there were human
almost immediately. And that display of pain was what did that. Giving
them a voice. Giving them a voice, especially a voice of dislike, of
pain. I have to connect you to my friend Eddie Chang, he studied
speech and language, he's a neurosurgeon, and we're life-long friends.
He studied speech and language, but he describes some of these more
primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans of delight,
other sounds as well, use your imagination, as such powerful rudders
for the other, for the emotions of other people. And so, I find it
fascinating, I can't wait to see this video. So, is the video
available online? No, I haven't recorded it, I just hit a bunch of
Roombas that are able to scream in pain in my Boston place. [Andrew
laughing] So, like people already Next podcast episode with Lex, maybe
we'll have that one, who knows? So, the thing is like people, I've
noticed because I talk so much about love and it's really who I am, I
think they want to, to a lot of people, seems like there's there got
to be a dark person in there somewhere. And I thought if I release
videos of Roombas screaming and they're like, yep, yep, that guy's
definitely insane. What about like shouts of glee and delight, you
could do that too, right? Well, I don't know how to, to me, delight is
quiet, right? You're a Russian. Americans are much louder than
Russians. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. But like I don't, unless you're talking
about like, I don't know how you would have sexual relationships with
the Roomba. Well, I wasn't necessarily saying a sexual delight, but
Trust me, I tried. I'm just kidding, that's a joke, internet. Okay
[giggles] but I was fascinated in the psychology of how little it
took. 'Cause you mentioned you had a negative relationship with a
Roomba. Well, I'd find that mostly, I took it for granted. Yeah. It
just served me, it collected Costello's hair. And then when it would
do something I didn't like, I would get upset with it. So, that's not
a good relationship, it was taken for granted and I would get upset
and then I'd park it again, and I just like you're in the corner.
Yeah. But there's a way to frame it being quite dumb as almost cute.
You're almost connecting with it for its dumbness. And I think that's
artificial intelligence problem. [Andrew] It's interesting. I think
flaws should be feature, not a bug. So, along the lines of this, the
different sorts of relationships that one could have with robots, and
the fear, but also some of the positive relationships that one could
have, there's so much dimensionality, there's so much to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=5712"&gt;Power Dynamics In Relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But power dynamics in relationships are very interesting, because the
obvious ones, the unsophisticated view of this, is one, there's a
master and a servant, right? But there's also manipulation, there's
benevolent manipulation, children do this with parents, puppies do
this. Puppies turn their head and look cute and maybe give out a
little noise, kids coup and parents always think that they're doing
this because they love the parent, but in many ways, studies show that
those coups are ways to extract the sorts of behaviors and expressions
from the parent that they want. The child doesn't know it's doing
this, it's completely subconscious, but it's benevolent manipulation.
So, there's one version of fear of robots that I hear a lot about that
I think most people can relate to where the robots take over and they
become the masters and we become the servants. But there could be
another version that in certain communities that I'm certainly not a
part of, but they call topping from the bottom, where the robot is
actually manipulating you into doing things, but you are under the
belief that you are in charge, but actually they're in charge. And so,
I think that's one that if we could explore that for a second, you
could imagine it wouldn't necessarily be bad, although it could lead
to bad things. The reason I want to explore this, is I think people
always default to the extreme, like the robots take over and we're in
little jail cells and they're out having fun and ruling the universe.
What sorts of manipulation can a robot potentially carry out, good or
bad? Yeah. Just so, there's a lot of good and bad manipulation between
humans, right? Just like you said. [Lex sighing] To me [sighing]
especially like you said [giggles] topping from the bottom, is that
the term? I think someone from MIT told me that term. [Lex laughing]
It wasn't Lex. I think. So, first of all, there's power dynamics in
bed, and power dynamics in relationships, and power dynamics on the
street, and in the work environment, those are all very different. I
think power dynamics can make human relationships, especially romantic
relationships fascinating and rich and fulfilling and exciting and all
those kinds of things. So, I don't think in themselves they're bad,
and the same goes with robots. I really love the idea that a robot
will be at top or a bottom in terms of like power dynamics. And I
think everybody should be aware of that. And the manipulation is not
so much manipulation, but a dance of like pulling away, a push and
pull, and all those kinds of things. In terms of control, I think
we're very, very, very far away from AI systems that are able to lock
us up. To lock us up in, like to have so much control that we
basically cannot live our lives in the way that we want. I think
there's a, in terms of dangers of AI systems, there's much more
dangers that have to do with autonomous weapon systems and all those
kinds of things. So, the power dynamics as exercised in the struggle
between nations and war and all those kinds of things. But in terms of
personal relationships, I think power dynamics are a beautiful thing.
Now, there's of course, going to be all those kinds of discussions
about consent and rights and all those kinds of things. Well, here,
we're talking about, I always say in any discussion around this, if we
need to define a really the context, it always should be consensual,
age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate, but now
we're talking about human-robot interactions. And so, I guess that No,
I actually was trying to make a different point, which is I do believe
that robots will have rights down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=5951"&gt;Robot Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think in order for us to have deep, meaningful relationships
with robots, we would have to consider them as entities in themselves
that deserve respect. And that's a really interesting concept that I
think people are starting to talk about a little bit more, but it's
very difficult for us to understand how entities that are other than
human. I mean, the same as with dogs and other animals can have rights
on a level as humans. Well, yeah. We can't and nor should we do
whatever we want with animals, we have a USDA, we have Department of
Agriculture that deal with animal care and use committees for
research, for farming and ranching and all that. So, when you first
said it, I thought, wait, why would, there'll be a bill of robotic
rights, but it absolutely makes sense in the context of everything
we've been talking about up until now. If you're willing, I'd love to
talk about dogs, because you've mentioned dogs a couple of times, a
robot dog, you had a biological dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=6020"&gt;Dogs: Homer &amp;amp; Costello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. - Yeah. I had a Newfoundland named Homer for many years growing
up. In Russia or in the U.S.? In the United States. And he was about,
he's over 200 pounds, that's a big dog. That's a big dog. People know
Newfoundland. So, he's this black dog that's a really a long hair and
just a kind soul. I think perhaps that's true for a lot of large, but
he thought he was a small dog. So, he moved like that, and Was he your
dog? Yeah, yeah. So, you had him since he was fairly young? Since the
very, very beginning, till the very, very end. And one of the things,
I mean, he had this kind of a, we mentioned like the Roombas, he had
kind-hearted dumbness about him that was just overwhelming, it's part
of the reason I named him Homer, because it's after Homer Simpson, in
case people are wondering which Homer I'm referring to. [Andrew
laughing] And so, there's a. Yeah, exactly. There's a clumsiness that
was just something that immediately led to a deep love for each other.
And one of the, I mean, he was always, it's the shared moments, he was
always there for so many a nights together, that's a powerful thing
about a dog that he was there through all the loneliness, through all
the tough times, through the successes and all those kinds of things.
And I remember, I mean, that was a really moving moment for me, I
still miss him to this day. How long ago did he die? Maybe 15 years
ago. So, it's been awhile. But it was the first time I've really
experienced like the feeling of death. So, what happened, is he got a
cancer. And so, he was dying slowly. And then there's a certain point
he couldn't get up anymore. Now, there's a lot of things that could
say here that I struggle with. Maybe he suffered much longer than he
needed to, that's something I really think about a lot. But I remember
when I had to take him to the hospital and the nurses couldn't carry
him, right? So, you're talking about a 200 pound dog and I was really
into power lifting at the time. And I remember they tried to figure
out all these kinds of ways to. So, in order to put them to sleep,
they had to take them into a room. And so, I had to carry him
everywhere. And here's this dying friend of mine that I just had to,
first of all, that was really difficult to carry, somebody that heavy
when they're not helping you out. And, yeah. So, I remember it was the
first time seeing a friend laying there and seeing life drain from his
body. And that realization that we're here for a short time was made
so real, that here is friend that was there for me the week before,
the day before, and now he's gone. And that was, I don't know, that
spoke to the fact that he could be deeply connected with the dog. Also
spoke to the fact that the shared moments together that led to that
deep friendship will make life so amazing, but it also spoke to the
fact that death is a motherfucker. So, I know you've lost Costello
recently. Yeah. And you can- - And as you're saying this, I'm
definitely fighting back the tears. I thank you for sharing that. That
I guess we're about to both cry over, I don't want to say dogs
[laughing] that it was bound to happen just given when this is
happening. Yeah, it's How long did you know that Costello was not
doing well? We'll, let's see, a year ago during the start of, about
six months into the pandemic, he started getting abscesses and he was
not, his behavior change and something really changed. And then I put
him on testosterone which helped a lot of things. It certainly didn't
cure everything, but it helped a lot of things, he was dealing with
joint pain, sleep issues, and then it just became a very slow decline
to the point where two, three weeks ago, he had a closet full of
medication. I mean, this dog was, it was like a pharmacy. It's amazing
to me when I looked at it the other day, I still haven't cleaned up
and removed all those things, 'cause I can't quite bring myself to do
it, but Do you think he was suffering? Well, so, what happened, was
about a week ago, it was really just about a week ago, it's amazing.
He was going up the stairs, I saw him slip. And he was a big guy, he
wasn't 200 pounds, but he was about 90 pounds, he's a bulldog, he was
pretty big and he was fit. And then I noticed that he wasn't carrying
a foot in the back like it was injured, it had no feeling at all. He
never liked me to touch his hind paws, and I could do, that thing was
just flopping there. And then the vet found some spinal degeneration
and I was told that the next one would go. Did he suffer? Sure, hope
not, but something changed in his eyes. Yeah. - Yeah, it's the eyes
again, I know you and I spend long hours on the phone and tell you
about like the eyes and what they convey and what they mean about
internal states and for sake of robots and biology of other kinds, but
You think something about him was gone in his eyes? I think he was
real, here, I am anthropomorphizing, I think he was realizing that one
of his great joys in life, which was to walk and sniff and pee on
things. [Lex laughing] This dog. The fundamental. - Loved to pee on
things, it was amazing. I've wondered where he put it, he was like a
reservoir of urine, it was incredible. I think, oh, that's Eddie, he'd
put like one drop on the 50 millionth plant. And then we get to the 50
millionth in one plant, and he just have, leave a puddle. And here I
am talking about Costello peeing. He was losing that ability to stand
up and do that, he was falling down while he was doing that. And I do
think he started to realize. And the passage was easy and peaceful,
but I'll say this, I'm not ashamed to say it, I mean, I wake up every
morning since then just, I don't even make the conscious decision to
allow my self to cry, I wake up crying. And I'm unfortunately able to
make it through the day, thanks to the great support of my friends and
you and my family, but I miss him, man. You miss him? Yeah, I miss
him. And I feel like, Homer, Costello, the relationship to one's dog
is so specific part. So, that part of you is gone? That's the hard
thing. What I think is different, is that I made the mistake, I think.
Moreover, I hope it was a good decision, but sometimes I think I made
the mistake of I brought Costello a little bit to the world through
the podcast or posting about him, I anthropomorphized about him in
public. Let's be honest, I have no idea what his mental life was, or
his relationship to me. And I'm just exploring all this for the first
time 'cause he was my first dog, but I raised him since he was seven
weeks. Yeah, you got hold it together, I noticed the episode you
released on Monday, you mentioned Costello. Like you brought them back
to life for me for that brief moment. Yeah. But he's gone. That's the,
he's going to be gone for a lot of people too. Well, this is what I'm
struggling with. I think that maybe you're pretty good at this. Like,
have you done this before? [Andrew laughing] This is the challenge. Is
that actually part of me. I know how to take care of myself pretty
well. Yeah. Not perfectly, but pretty well. And I have good support. I
do worry a little bit about how it's going to land and how people will
feel. I'm concerned about their internalization. So that's something
I'm still iterating on. And you have to watch you struggle, which is
fascinating. Right. And I've mostly been shielding them from this, but
what would make me happiest is if people would internalize some of
Costello's best traits. And his best traits were that he was
incredibly tough. I mean, he was a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, the whole
thing. He was just born that way. What was so beautiful is that his
toughness has never what he rolled forward. It was just how sweet and
kind he was. And so if people can take that, then there's a win in
there someplace, so. I think there's some ways in which she should
probably live on in your podcast too. You should, I mean, it's such a,
one of the things I loved about his role in your podcast is that he
brought so much joy to you. We mentioned the robots. Mm-hmm. Right? I
think that's such a powerful thing to bring that joy into, like,
allowing yourself to experience that joy, to bring that joy to others,
to share it with others. That's really powerful. And I mean, not to,
this is like the Russian thing, is [chuckles] it touched me when Lucy
Kay had that moment that I keep thinking about in this show "Louie,"
or like an old man was criticizing Louis for whining about breaking up
with his girlfriend, and he was saying like the most beautiful thing
about love, they made a song that's catchy now that's now making me
feel horrible saying it, but like, is the loss. The loss really also
is making you realize how much that person, that dog meant to you. And
like allowing yourself to feel that loss and not run away from that
loss is really powerful. And in some ways that's also sweet, just like
the love was the loss is also sweet because you know that you felt a
lot for that through your friend. So I, and like continue to bring
that joy. I think it would be amazing to the podcast. I hope to do the
same with [laughing] robots, or whatever else is the source of joy,
right? And maybe, do you think about one day getting another dog?
Yeah, in time. You're hitting on all the key buttons here. I want that
to, we're thinking about ways to kind of immortalize Costello in a way
that's real, not just creating some little logo or something silly.
Costello much like David Goggins is a person, but Goggins also has
grown into kind of a verb. You're going to Goggins this or you're
going to, and there's an adjective. Like that's extreme. Like it, I
think that for me, Costello was all those things. He was a being, he
was his own being, he was a noun, a verb and an adjective. So, and he
had this amazing super power that I wish I could get, which is this
ability to get everyone else to do things for you without doing a
thing. [Lex laughing] The Costello effect, as I call it. So is an idea
I hope he lives on. Yes. Thank you for that. This actually has been
very therapeutic for me, which actually brings me to a question, we're
friends, we're not just co-scientists, colleagues working on a project
together and in the world, that's somewhat similar. Just two dogs.
Just two dogs basically. But let's talk about friendship,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=6761"&gt;Friendship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because I think that I certainly know as a scientist that there are
elements that are very lonely of the scientific pursuit. There are
elements of many pursuits that are lonely. Music, Math always seem to
me like they're like the loneliest people. Who knows if that's true or
not. Also people work in teams. And sometimes people are surrounded by
people interacting with people and they feel very lonely. But for me,
and I think as well for you, friendship is an incredibly strong force
in making one feel like certain things are possible or worth reaching
for, maybe even making us compulsively reach for them. So, when you
were growing up, you grew up in Russia until what age? 13. Okay. And
then you moved directly to Philadelphia? To Chicago. [Andrew] Chicago.
And then Philadelphia, and San Francisco and Boston and so on. But
really to Chicago, that's where I went to high school. Do you have
siblings? Older brother. But most people don't know that. [Lex
laughing] Yeah, he is a very different person. But somebody I
definitely look up to. So he's a wild man. He's extrovert, he was
into, I mean, so he's also scientists, a bio engineer, but he's, when
we were growing up, he was the person who did, drank and did every
drug. And, but also as the life of the party. And I just thought he
was the, when your older brother, five years older, he was the coolest
person that I was wanting to be him. So for that, he definitely had a
big influence. But I think for me in terms of friendship, growing up,
I had one really close friend. And then when I came here I had another
close friend, but I'm very, I believe, I don't know if I believe, but
I draw a lot of strength from deep connections with other people, and
just the small number of people. Just a really small number of people.
That's when I moved to this country, I was really surprised how, like,
there were these large groups of friends, quote, unquote. But the
depth of connection was not there at all from my sort of perspective.
Now, I moved to the suburb of Chicago, was Naperville. It's more like
a middle class, maybe upper middle class. So it's like people that
cared more about material possessions than deep human connection. So
that added to the thing. But I drove more meaning than almost anything
else was from friendship. Early on I had a best friend. His name was,
his name is Yura. I don't know how to say it in English. How do you
say in Russian? Yura. What's his last name? Do you remember if was...
[Lex chuckles] Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. So we just spent all our time
together. There's also a group of friends. Like, I dunno, it's like
eight guys. In Russia growing up, it's like parents didn't care if
you're coming back at certain hour. So we'll spent all day, all night
just playing soccer, usually called football, and just talking about
life and all those kinds of things, even at that young age. I think
people in Russia and Soviet Union grew up much quicker. [Lex chuckles]
I think the education system at the university level is world-class in
the United States in terms of like, really creating really big,
powerful minds. At least they used to be, but I think that they aspire
to that. But the education system for like, for younger kids in the
Soviet Union was incredible. Like they did not treat us as kids. The
level of literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky. When you were a small child?
Yeah. Amazing. Amazing. And like the level of mathematics, and you're
made to feel like shit if you're not good at mathematics. Like we, I
think in this country, there's more like, especially young kids 'cause
they're so cute. Like they're being babied. We only start to really
push adults later in life. Like, so if you want to be the best in the
world at this, then you get to be pushed. But we were pushed at a
young age. Everybody was pushed. And that brought out the best in
people. I think it really forced people to discover, like discover
themselves in the Goggin style, but also discover what they're
actually passionate about, what they're not. Is this true for boys and
girls? Were they pushed equally there? Yeah. They were pushed. Yeah,
they were pushed equally, I would say. There was a, obviously there
was more, not obviously, but at least from my memories, more of a,
what's the right way to put it? But there was like gender roles, but
not in a negative connotation. It was the red dress versus the suit
and tie kind of connotation, which is like, there's a, like guys like
lifting heavy things and girls like creating beautiful art, and, like
there's A more traditional view of gender, more 1950, '60s. But we
didn't think in terms of, at least at that age, in terms of like roles
and then like a homemaker or something like that or not, it was more
about what people care about. Like girls cared about this set of
things, and guys cared about the set of things. I think mathematics
and engineering was something that guys cared about and sort of, at
least my perception of that time. And then girls cared about beauty.
So like guys want to create machines, girls want to create beautiful
stuff. [Lex laughing] And now, of course, that I don't take that
forward in some kind of philosophy of life, but it's just the way I
grew up and the way I remember it. But all, everyone worked hard. The
value of hard work was instilled in everybody. And through that, I
think it's a little bit of hardship. Of course also economically
everybody was poor, especially with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
There's poverty everywhere. You didn't notice it as much, but there
was a, because there's not much material possessions, there was a huge
value placed on human connection. Just meeting with neighbors,
everybody knew each other. We lived in an apartment building very
different than you have in the United States these days. Everybody
knew each other. You would get together, drink vodka, smoke
cigarettes, and play guitar and sing sad songs about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=7187"&gt;Russians &amp;amp; Suffering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's with the sad songs in the Russian thing? I mean, Russians do I
express joy from time to time. Yeah, they do. Certainly you do. But
what do you think that's about? Is it 'cause it's cold there? But it's
called other places too, right? I think, let's just, first of all the
Soviet Union, the echoes of World War II and the millions and millions
and millions of people that, civilians that were slaughtered, and also
starvation is there, right? So like the echoes of that, of the ideas,
the literature, the art is there. Like that's a grandparents, that's
parents, that's all there. So that contributes to it, that life can be
absurdly unexplainably cruel. At any moment everything can change. So
that's in there. Then I think there's an empowering aspect to finding
beauty in suffering that then everything else is beautiful too. It's
like, if you just linger or it's like, why you meditate on death? Is
like, if you just think about the worst possible case and find beauty
in that, then everything else is beautiful too. And so you write songs
about the dark stuff. And that's somehow helps you deal with whatever
comes. There's a hopelessness to the Soviet Union that, like,
inflation, all those kinds of things where people were sold dreams and
never delivered. And so like, there's a, if you don't sing songs about
sad things, you're going to become cynical about this world. Mm-hmm.
Interesting. So they don't want to give in to cynicism. Now, a lot of
people did, one of the, but that is the battle against cynicism. One
of the things that may be common in Russia is a kind of cynicism
about, like, if I told you the thing I said earlier about dreaming
about robots, it's very common for people to dismiss that dream, of
saying, no, that's not, that's too wild. Like, who else do you know
that did that? Or you want to start a podcast? Like who else? Like
nobody's making money on podcasts. Like, why do you want to start a
podcast? That kind of mindset I think is quite common, which is why I
would say entrepreneurship in Russia is still not very good. Which to
be a business, like, to be an entrepreneur you have to dream big, and
you have to have others around you, like friends and support group
that make you dream big. But if you don't give in to cynicism and
appreciate the beauty in the unfairness of life, the absurd unfairness
of life, then I think it just makes you appreciative of everything.
It's like a, it's a prerequisite for gratitude. And so, yeah, I think
that instilled in me ability to appreciate everything, just like
everything. Everything's amazing. And then also there is a culture of
like romanticizing everything. Like, it's almost like romantic
relationships were very like soap opera, like is very like over the
top dramatic. And I think that it was instilled in me too, not only do
I appreciate everything about life, but I get like emotional about it.
In a sense, like, I get like a visceral feeling of joy for everything.
And the same with friends or people of the opposite sex. Like, there's
a deep, like emotional connection there that like [laughing] that's
like way too dramatic too. Like, I guess relative to what the actual
moment is. But I derive so much deep, like dramatic joy from so many
things in life. And I think I would attributed that to the upbringing
in Russia. But the thing that sticks most of all is the friendship.
And have now since then had one other friend like that in the United
States, he lives in Chicago. His name is Matt. And slowly here and
there accumulating really fascinating people, but I'm very selective
with that. Funny enough, the few times, it's not few it's a lot of
times now interacting with Joe Rogan [chuckles] it's sounds surreal to
say, but there was a kindred spirit there. Like I've connected with
him. And there's been people like that also in the grappling sports
that are really connected with. I've actually struggled, which is why
I'm so glad to be your friend, is I've struggled to connect with
scientists. They can be a little bit wooden sometimes. [Lex] Yeah.
Even the biologist. I mean, one thing that I, well, I'm so struck by
the fact that you work with robots, you're an engineer, AI, science
technology, and that all sounds like hardware, right? But what you're
describing and I know is true about you is this deep emotional life
and this resonance and it's really wonderful. I actually think it's
one of the reasons why so many people, scientists and otherwise have
gravitated towards you and your podcast is because you hold both
elements. In the Hermann Hesse's book, I don't know if you, "Narcissus
and Goldmund," right? It's about these elements of the logical
rational mind and the emotional mind and how those are woven together.
And if people haven't read it, they should, and you embody the full
picture. And I think that's so much of what draws people to you. I've
read every Hermann Hesse book by the way. As usual [chuckles] as usual
I've done about 9% of what life is. No, it's true. You mentioned Joe,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=7538"&gt;Public vs. Private Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who is a phenomenal human being, not just for his amazing
accomplishments, but for how he shows up to the world one on one. I
think I heard him say the other day on an interview, he said, there is
no public or private version of him. And he's like, this is me. He
said that it was beautiful. He said, I'm like the fish that got
through the net. And there is no onstage offstage version. And you're
absolutely right. And I. Fish. [Lex laughing] So, but, well, you guys,
I have a question actually about But that's a really good point about
public and private life. He was a huge, if I could just comment real
quick. Like that, he was a, I've been a fan of Joe for a long time,
but he's been an inspiration to not have any difference between public
and private life. I actually had a conversation with Naval about this,
and he said that you can't have a rich life, like exciting life if
you're the same person publicly and privately. And I think I
understand that idea, but I don't agree with it. I think that's really
fulfilling and exciting to be the same person privately and publicly
with very few exceptions. Now that said, I don't have any really
strange sex kinks. So like, I feel like it can be open with basically
everything. I don't have anything I'm ashamed of. There's some things
that could be perceived poorly, like the screaming Roombas, but I'm
not ashamed of them. I just have to present them in the right context.
But there's a freedom to being the same person in private as in
public. And that Joe made me realize that you can be that. And also to
be kind to others. It sounds kind of absurd, but I really always
enjoyed like being good to others. Like just being kind towards
others. But I always felt like the world didn't want me to be. Like,
there's so much negativity when I was growing up, like just around
people. If you actually just notice how people talk, they, from like,
complaining about the weather, this could be just like the big cities
that I've visited. But there's a general negativity, and positivity is
kind of suppressed. You're not, one, you're not seen as very
intelligent, and two, there's a kind of, you're seen as like a little
bit of a weirdo. And so I always felt like I had to hide that. And
what Joe made me realize, one, I could be fully just the same person
private and public, and two, I can embrace being kind, in just, in the
way that I like, in the way I know how to do. And sort of for me on
like, on Twitter or like publicly, whenever I say stuff, that means
saying stuff simply almost to the point of cliche. And like, I have
the strength now to say it, even if I'm being mocked. [Lex laughing]
You know what I mean? Like, just it's okay. If everything's going to
be okay. Okay, some people will think you're dumb. They're probably
right. The point is, like, just enjoy being yourself. And that Joe,
more than almost anybody else, because he's so successful at it,
inspired me to do that. Be kind and be the same person, private and
public. I love it. And I love the idea that authenticity doesn't have
to be oversharing, right? That it doesn't mean you reveal every detail
of your life. It's a way of being true to an essence of oneself.
Right. There's never a feeling when you deeply think and introspect
that you're hiding something from the world or you're being dishonest
in some fundamental way. So, yeah, that's truly liberating. It allows
you to think, it allows you to like think freely, to speak freely, to
just to be freely. That said, it's not like there's not still a
responsibility to be the best version of yourself. So, I'm very
careful with the way I say something. So, the whole point, it's not so
simple to express the spirit that's inside you with words. I mean,
some people are much better than others. I struggle. Like oftentimes
when I say something and I hear myself say it, it sounds really dumb
and not at all what I meant. So that's the responsibility you have.
It's not just like being the same person publicly and privately means
you can just say whatever the hell. It means there's still
responsibility to try to be, to express who you truly are. And that's
hard. [Lex chuckles] It hard. And I think that, we have this pressure,
all people, when I say we, I mean all humans, and maybe robots too,
feel this pressure to be able to express ourselves in that one moment
in that one form. And it is beautiful when somebody, for instance, can
capture some essence of love or sadness or anger or something in a
song or in a poem or in a short quote, but perhaps it's also possible
to do it in aggregate, all the things how you show up. For instance,
one of the things that initially drew me to want to get to know you as
a human being and a scientist and eventually we became friends, was
the level of respect that you brought to your podcast listeners by
wearing a suit. Yeah. - I'm being serious here. I was raised thinking
that if you overdress a little bit, overdressed by American, certainly
by American standards, you're overdressed for a podcast, but it's
genuine. You're not doing it for any reason, except I have to assume,
and I assumed at the time, that it was because you have a respect for
your audience, you respect them enough to show up a certain way for
them. It's for you also, but it's for them. Yeah. And I think between
that and your commitment to your friendship, just the way that you
talk about friendships and love and the way you hold up these higher
ideals, I think at least as a consumer of your content and as your
friend, what I find, is that in aggregate, you're communicating who
you are, it doesn't have to be one quote or something. And I think
that we're sort of obsessed by like the one Einstein quote, or the one
line of poetry or something, but I think you so embody the way that,
and Joe as well, it's about how you live your life and how you show up
as a collection of things and said and done. Yeah, that that's, and
so, the aggregate is the goal, the tricky thing, and Jordan Peterson
talks about this because he's under attack way more than you and I
will ever be, but Right now? For now, right? This is very true for
now. That the people who attack on the internet, this is one of the
problems with Twitter, is they don't consider the aggregate, they take
a single statements. And so, one of the defense mechanisms, like again
why Joe has been an inspiration, is that when you in aggregate, a good
person, a lot of people will know that. And so, that makes you much
more immune to the attacks of people that bring out an individual
statement that might be a misstatement of some kind, or doesn't
express who you are. And so, that, I like that idea is the aggregate.
And the power of the podcast, is you have hundreds of hours out there,
and being yourself and people get to know who you are. And once they
do, and you post pictures of screaming Roombas as you kick them, they
will understand that you don't mean well. By the way, as a side
comment, I don't know if I want to release this because it's not just
the Roombas You have a whole dungeon of robots. Okay. So, this is a
problem, the Boston Dynamics came up against this problem. But, let me
work this out like workshop this out with you, and maybe because we'll
post this, people will let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=8044"&gt;How To Treat a Robot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there's legged robots, they look like a dog, I'm trying to create
a very real human-robot connection, but like they're also incredible
because you can throw them like off of a building and they'll land
fine. And this beautiful. That's amazing. I've seen the Instagram
videos of like cats jumping off of like fifth story buildings and then
walking away. But no one should throw their cat out of a window of a
building. Well, this is the problem I'm experiencing, all certainly
kicking the robots, its really fascinating how they recover from those
kicks. But like just seeing myself do it and also seeing others do it,
it just does not look good, and I don't know what to do with that.
'Cause it's such a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] See. But you don't,
'cause you are- - A robot, no, I'm kidding. What's interesting? Yeah.
Before today's conversation, I probably could do it, and I'm thinking
about robots, bills of rights and things. Not to satisfy you or to
satisfy anything, except that if they have some sentience aspect to
their being, then I would load to kick it. I don't think we'd be able
to kick it, you might be able to kick the first time, but not the
second, this is the problem of experience. One of the cool things, is
one of the robots I'm working with, you can pick it up by one leg and
is dangling, and you can throw it in any kind of way and it'll land
correctly. So, it's really I had a friend who had a cat like that.
[Lex laughing] Oh man, we look forward to the letters on the cat Oh
no, I'm not suggesting anyone did that, but he had this cat, and the
cat, he would just throw it onto the bed from across the room, and
then it would run back for more, or somehow that was the nature of the
relationship. I think no one should do that to an animal, but this cat
seemed to return for whatever reason. But a robot is a robot, and it's
fascinating to me how hard it is for me to do that. So, it's
unfortunate, but I don't think I can do that to a robot. Like I
struggle with that. So, for me to be able to do that with a robot, I
have to almost get like into the state that I imagine like doctors get
into when they're doing surgery, like I have to do what robotics
colleagues of mine do, which is like start seeing it as an object.
Dissociate. Like dissociate. So, it was just fascinating that I have
to do that in to do that with a robot. I just want to take that little
bit of a tangent. No, I think it's an important thing. I mean, I'm not
shy about the fact that for many years I've worked on experimental
animals, and that's been a very challenging aspect of being a
biologist. Mostly mice, but in the past no longer, thank goodness
'cause I just don't like doing it, larger animals as well. And now I
work on humans, which I can give consent, verbal consent. So, I think
that it's extremely important to have an understanding of what the
guidelines are and where one's own boundaries are around this. It's
not just an important question, it might be the most important
question before any work can progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=8232"&gt;The Value of Friendship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you asked me about friendship. I know you have a lot of thoughts
about friendship, what do you think is the value of friendship in
life? Well, for me personally, just because of my life trajectory and
arc friendship, and I should say, I do have some female friends that
are just friends, they're completely platonic relationships, but it's
been mostly male friendship to me, has been It has been all male
friendships to me actually, yeah. Interesting. - Yeah. It's been an
absolute lifeline. They are my family, I have a biological family and
I have great respect and love for them and an appreciation for them,
but it's provided me the, I won't even say confidence because there's
always an anxiety in taking any good risk, or any risk worth taking.
It's given me the sense that I should go for certain things and try
certain things to take risk to weather that anxiety. And I don't
consider myself a particularly competitive person, but I would sooner
die than disappoint, or let down one of my friends. I can think of
nothing worse actually, than disappointing one of my friends,
everything else is secondary to me. What disappointment? Disappoint,
meaning not, I mean, certainly I strive always to show up as best I
can for the friendship, and that can be in small ways. That can mean
making sure the phone is away, sometimes it's about, I'm terrible with
punctuality 'cause I'm an academic. And so, I just get lost in time
and I don't mean anything, but it's striving to, to listen to, to
enjoy good times and to make time. It kind of goes back to this first
variable we talked about, to make sure that I spend time and to get
time in person and check in. And I think there's so many ways in which
friendship is vital to me, it's it's actually to me, what makes life
worth living. Yeah. Well, there's a, I am surprised like with the high
school friends how we don't actually talk that often these days in
terms of time, but every time we see each other, it's immediately
right back to where we started. So, I struggled that how much time you
really allocate, for the friendship to be deeply meaningful because
they're always there with me even if we don't talk often. So, there's
a kind of loyalty. I think maybe it's a different style, but I think
to me, friendship is being there in the hard times, I think. Like I'm
much more reliable when you're going through shit than in like You're
pretty reliable anyway. No, but if you're like a wedding or something
like that, or like, I don't know, like you want an award of some kind,
yeah, I'll congratulate the shit out of you, but like that's not, and
I'll be there, but that's not as important to me as being there when
like nobody else is like just being there when shit hits the fan, or
something's tough where the world turns their back on you, all those
kinds of things, that, to me, that's where friendship is meaningful.
Well, I know that to be true about you and that's a felt thing and a
real thing with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=8433"&gt;Martial Arts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me ask one more thing about that actually, because I'm not a
practitioner Jujitsu, I know you are, Joe is, but years ago, I read a
book that I really enjoyed, which is Sam Sheridan's book, " A
Fighter's Heart," he talks about all these different forms of martial
arts. And maybe it was in the book, maybe it was in an interview, but
he said that fighting, or being in physical battle with somebody,
Jujitsu boxing or some other form of direct physical contact between
two individuals creates this bond unlike any other. Because he said
it's like a one night stand, you're sharing bodily fluids with
somebody that you barely know. Yeah. And I chuckled about it 'cause
it's kind of funny and it kind of tongue in cheek. But at the same
time, I think this is a fundamental way in which members of a species
bond is through physical contact. And certainly, there are other
forms, there's cuddling, and there's hand holding, and there's in
their sexual intercourse, and there's all sorts of things. What's
cuddling? I haven't heard of it. I heard this recently, I didn't know
this term, but there's a term, they've turned the noun cupcake into a
verb, cupcaking it turns out, I just learned about this. Cupcaking is
when you spend time just cuddling. I didn't know about this. You heard
it here first, although I heard it first just the other day. Cupcaking
is actually a Cuddling is everything, it's not just like, is it in
bed, or is it in the coach? Like what's cuddling? I do look up what
cuddling is We need to look at this up and we need to define the
variables. I think it definitely has to do with physical contact, I'm
told, but in terms of battle, a competition, and the Sheridan quote,
I'm just curious. So, do you get close, or feel a bond with people
that, for instance, you rolled Jujitsu with, or even though you don't
know anything else about them, was he right about this? Yeah, I mean
on many levels. He also has the book, what? "A Fighter's Mind." Yeah,
that was the third one. He's actually an excellent writer. What's
interesting about him, just briefly about Sheridan, I don't know him,
but I did a little bit of research, he went to Harvard, he was an art
major at Harvard, he claims all he did was smoke cigarettes and do
art. I don't know if his art was any good. And I think his father was
in the SEAL teams. And then when he got out of Harvard, graduated, he
took off around the world learning all the forms of martial arts, and
was early to the kind of ultimate fighting kind of mixed martial arts
and things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. It's amazing. I don't actually
remember it, but I read it, and I remember thinking that was an
amazing encapsulation of what makes fighting like the art, like what
makes it compelling. I would say that there's so many ways that
Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports in general, is like one of
the most intimate things you could do. I don't know if I would
describe in terms of bodily liquids and all those kinds of things. I
think he was more or less joking. I think there's a few ways that it
does that. So, one, because you're so vulnerable [sighs] So, the
honesty of stepping on the mat and often all of us have ego thinking
we're better than we are at this particular art. And then the honesty
of being submitted, or being worse than you thought you are and just
sitting with that knowledge, that kind of honesty, we don't get to
experience it in most of daily life. We can continue living somewhat
of an illusion of our conceptions of ourselves 'cause people are not
going to hit us with the reality, the mat speaks only the truth, the
reality just hits you. And that vulnerability is the same as like the
loss of a loved one, though it's the loss of a reality that you knew
before, you now have to deal with this new reality. And when you're
sitting there in that vulnerability, and there's these other people
that are also sitting in that vulnerability, you get to really connect
like, fuck, like I'm not as special as I thought I was, and life is
like not, life is harsher than I thought I was, and we're just sitting
there with that reality, some of us can put words to them, some we
can't. So, I think that definitely, is a thing that at least the
intimacy. The other thing is the human contact. There's something
about, I mean, like a big hug, like during COVID, very few people
hugged me and I hugged them, and I always felt good when they did.
Like we were all tested, and especially now we're vaccinated, but
there's still people, this is true of San Francisco's, it's true in
Boston, they want to keep, not only six feet away, but stay at home
and never touch you. That loss of basic humanity is the opposite of
what I feel in Jujitsu, where it was like that contact where you're
like, I don't give a shit about whatever rules we're supposed to have
in society where you have to keep a distance and all that kind of
stuff. Just the hug, like the intimacy of a hug, that's like a good
bear hug, and you're like just controlling another person, and also
there is some kind of love communicated through just trying to break
each other's arms. I don't exactly understand why violence is the such
a close neighbor to love, but it is. Well, in the hypothalamus, the
neurons that control sexual behavior, but also non-sexual contact, are
not just nearby the neurons that control aggression and fighting, they
are salt and pepper with those neurons. It's a very interesting, and
it almost sounds kind of risky and controversial and stuff, I'm not
anthropomorphizing about what this means, but in the brain, those
structures are interdigitated, you can't separate them except at a
very fine level. And here, the way you describe it, is the same as a
real thing. I do want to make an interesting comment. Again, these are
the things that could be taken out of context, but one of the amazing
things about Jujitsu, is both guys and girls train it. And I was
surprised. So, like I'm a big fan of yoga pants [giggles] at the gym
kind of thing. It reveals the beauty of the female form. But the thing
is, like girls are dressed in skintight clothes in Jujitsu often. And
I found myself not at all, thinking like that at all when training
with girls. Well, the context is very non-sexual. But I was surprised
to learn that. When I first started to Jujitsu, I thought, wouldn't
that be kind of weird to train with the opposites that in something so
intimate. So, boys and girls, men and women, they roll Jujitsu
together? Completely. - Interesting. And the only times girls kind of
try to stay away from guys, I mean, there's two contexts, of course,
there's always going to be creeps in this world. So, everyone knows
who kind of stay away from, and the other is there's a size disparity.
So, girls will often try to roll with people a little bit closer
weight-wise, But no, that's one of the things that are empowering to
women, that's what they fall in love with when they started doing
Jujitsu, is first of all, they gain an awareness and a pride over
their body, which is great. And then second, they get to [chuckles]
especially later on, start submitting big dudes like these bros that
come in who are all shredded and like muscular, and they get to
technique to exercise dominance over them, and that's a powerful
feeling. You've seen women force a larger guy to tap her, or even
choke them up. Well, I was deadlifting like a four, oh boy, I think
it's 495. So, I was really into power-lifting when I started at
Jujitsu, and I remember being submitted by, I thought I walked in
feeling like I'm going to be, if not the greatest fighter ever, at
least top three. And so, as a white belt, you roll in like all happy.
And then you realize that as long as you're not applying too much
force, that you're having, I remember being submitted many times by
like 130, 120-pound girls at our Balance Studios in Philadelphia, that
a lot of incredible female Jujitsu players. And that's really humbling
too that technique can overpower in combat pure strength. And that's
the other thing, there is something about combat that's primal. Like
there, it just feels, it feels like we were born to do this. Like that
We have circuits in our brain that are dedicated to this kind of
interaction. There's no question. And that's what it felt like, it
wasn't that I'm learning a new skill. It was like, somehow I am a
remembering echoes of something I've learned in the past. Well, it's
like hitting puberty. A child before puberty has no concept of boys
and girls having this attraction, regardless of whether or not they're
attracted to boys or girl, doesn't matter. At some point, most people,
not all, but certainly, but most people, when they hit puberty,
suddenly people appear differently, and certain people take on a
romantic or sexual interest for the very first time. Yeah. And so it's
like, it's revealing a circuitry in the brain. It's not like they
learn that it's innate. And I think it, when I hear the way you
describe Jujitsu and enrolling Jujitsu, it reminds me a little bit,
Joe was telling me recently about the first time he went hunting and
he felt like it revealed a circuit that was in him all along, but he
hadn't experienced before. Yeah. That's definitely there. And of
course, there's the physical activity. One of the interesting things
about Jujitsu is it's one of the really strenuous exercises that you
can do late into your adult life, like into your 50, 60, 70s, 80s.
When I came up, there's a few people in their 80s that were training.
And as long as you're smart, as long as you practice techniques and
pick your partners correctly, you can do that kind of art. That's late
into life. And so you're getting exercise. There's not many activities
I find that are amenable to that. So, because it's such a thinking
game, the Jujitsu in particular is an art or technique pays off a lot.
So you can still maintain, first of all, remain injury free if you use
good technique, and also through good technique be able to go, be
active with people that are much, much younger. And so that was, to
me, that and running are the two activities you can kind of do late in
life. Because to me a healthy life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=9094"&gt;Body-Mind Interactions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has exercises as the piece of the puzzle. No, absolutely. And I'm glad
that we're on the physical component, because I know that there's for
you, you've talked before about the crossover between the physical and
the intellectual and the mental. Are you still running at ridiculous
hours of the night for ridiculously long? Yeah, so, definitely. I've
been running late at night here in Austin. People tell, the area we're
in now, people say it's a dangerous area, which I find laughable
coming from the bigger cities. No, I run late at night. There's
something. If you see a guy running through Austin at 2:00 a.m. in a
suit and tie, it's probably. [Lex laughing] Well, yeah. I mean, I do
think about that 'cause I get recognized more and more in Austin. I
worry that, but not really, that I get recognized late at night. But
there is something about the night that brings out those deep
philosophical thoughts and self-reflection, that really enjoy. But
recently I started getting back to the grind. So I'm going to be
competing or hoping to be compete in September and October. In
Jujitsu? In Jujitsu, yeah. To get back to competition. And so that
requires getting back into a great cardio shape. I've been getting,
running as part of my daily routine. Got it. [Lex] Yeah. Well, I
always know I can reach you regardless of time zone in the middle of
the night, wherever that happens. Well, part of that has to be just
being single and being a programmer. Those two things just don't work
well in terms of a steady sleep schedule. It's not bankers hours kind
of work. Nine to five. I want to, you mentioned single.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=9202"&gt;Romantic Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to ask you a little bit about the other form of relationship,
which is romantic love. So, your parents are still married? Still
married, still happily married. That's impressive. [Lex] Yeah. A rare
thing nowadays. [Lex] Yeah. So you grew up with that example? Yeah. I
guess that's a powerful thing, right? If there's an example that I
think can work. Yeah. I didn't have that in my own family, but when I
see it, it's inspiring and it's beautiful. The fact that they have
that, and that was the norm for you, I think is really wonderful.
Well, it was a, in the case of my parents it was interesting to watch
'cause there's obviously tension. Like, there'll be times where they
fought and all those kinds of things. They obviously get frustrated
with each other and they like, but they find mechanisms how to
communicate that to each other, like to make fun of each other a
little bit, like to tease, to get some of that frustration out, and
then ultimately to reunite and find their joyful moments and be that
the energy. I think it's clear 'cause I got together in there I think
early 20s, like very, very young. I think you grow together as people.
Yeah. You're still in the critical period of brain plasticity.
[laughing] And also, I mean, it's just like divorce was so frowned
upon that you stick it out. And I think a lot of couples especially
from that time, the Soviet Union, that's probably applies to a lot of
cultures. You stick it out and you put in the work, you learn how to
put in the work. And once you do, you start to get to some of those
rewarding aspects of being, like through time has sharing so many
moments together. That's definitely something that was an inspiration
to me, but maybe that's where I have. So I have a similar kind of
longing to have a lifelong partner, like to have that kind of view,
where same with friendship, lifelong friendship is the most meaningful
kind. That there is something with that time of sharing all that time
together. Like till death do us part is a powerful thing. Not by
force, not because of the religion said it or the government said it
or your culture said it, but because you want to. Do you want
children? Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's How many
Roombas do you have? Oh, I thought You should, no, no Human children?
No, human to human children. 'Cause I already have the children.
Exactly. What I was saying, you probably need to at least as many
human children as you do Roombas. Big family, small family. So. In
your mind's eyes, they're a bunch of Fridman's running around. So I'll
tell you, like realistically, I can explain exactly my thinking, and
this is similar to the robotics work is, if I'm like purely logical
right now, my answer would be I don't want kids. Because I just don't
have enough time. I have so much going on. But when I'm using the same
kind of vision I use for the robots is I know my life will be
transformed with the first. Like I know I would love being a father.
And so the question of how many, that's on the other side of that
hill. It could be some ridiculous number. So I just know that I have a
feeling and I could be, I don't have a crystal ball, but I don't know.
I see an upwards of, certainly three or more come comes to mind. So
much of that has to do with the partner you're with too. So like that,
that's such an open question, especially in this society of what the
right partnership is. 'Cause I'm deeply empathetic. I want to see,
like to me, what I look for in your relationship is for me to be
really excited about the passions of another person, like whatever
they're into, it doesn't have to be a career success. Any kind of
success, just to be excited for them, and for them to be excited for
me. And like share in that excitement and build, and build and build.
But there was also practical aspects of like, what kind of shit do you
enjoy doing together? And I think family is a real serious
undertaking. It certainly is. I mean, I think that I have a friend who
said it, I think best, which is that you first have, he's in a very
successful relationship and has a family. And he said, you first have
to define the role and then you have to cast the right person for the
role. [Lex laughing] Well, yeah, there's some deep aspects of that,
but there's also an aspect to which you're not smart enough from this
side of it to define the role. I think there's part of it that has to
be a leap that you have to take. And I see having kids that way. You
just have to go with it and figure it out also. As long as there's
love there, like what the hell is life for even? So I've, there's so
many incredibly successful people that I know that I've gotten to know
that all have kids. And the presence of kids for the most part has
only been something that energizes them, something they gave them
meaning, something that made them the best version of themselves, like
made them more productive, not less, which is fascinating to me. It is
fascinating. I mean, you can imagine if the way that you felt about
Homer, the way that I feel and felt about Costello is at all a glimpse
of what that must be like then. Exactly. The downside, the thing I
worry more about is the partner side of that. I've seen, the kids are
almost universally a source of increased productivity and joy and
happiness. Like, yeah, they're a pain in the ass. Yeah, is
complicated. Yeah, so and so forth, people like to complain about
kids. But then when you actually look past that little shallow layer
of complaint, kids are great. The source of pain for a lot of people
is if when the relationship doesn't work. And so I'm very kind of
concerned about like, dating is very difficult, and I'm a complicated
person. And so it's been very difficult to find the right kind of
person. But that statement doesn't even make sense because I'm not on
dating apps, I don't see people. You're like the first person I saw in
awhile. It's like you and Michael Malice and like Joe. So, like, I
don't think I've seen like a female. What is it? An element of the
female species in quite a while. So, I think you have to put yourself
out there. What is it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will find you,
but only if you're looking. So there's some element of really taking
the leap and putting yourself out there in kind of different
situations. And I don't know how to do that when you're behind a
computer all the time. Well, you're a builder and you're a problem
solver, and you find solutions, and I'm confident the solution is out
there, and. I think you're implying that I'm going to build the
girlfriend, which I think. Well, and maybe we shouldn't separate this
friendship, the notion of friendship and community, and if we go back
to this concept of the aggregate, maybe you'll meet this woman through
a friend, or maybe you'll or something of that sort. So, one of the
things, I dunno if you feel the same way, I definitely one of those
people that just falls in love and that's it. Yeah, I can't say I'm
like that. With Costello it was instantaneous. Yeah. It really was. I
mean, I know it's not romantic love, but it was instantaneous. No, I,
but that's me. And I think that if you know, you know, because that's
a good thing that you have there. It's, I'm very careful with that,
because you don't want to fall in love with the wrong person. So I try
to be very kind of careful with, I've noticed this because I fall in
love with every, like this mug, everything I fall in love with things
in this world. So, like, you have to be really careful because a girl
comes up to you and says she loves DUSTY HUSKY, that doesn't
necessarily mean to marry her tonight. Yes. And I like the way you
said that out loud so that you heard it, you doesn't mean you need to
marry her tonight, right? [Lex] Exactly. [Andrew] Right. But I mean,
but people are amazing, and people are beautiful and that's, so I'm
fully embraced that, but also you have to be careful with
relationships. And at the same time, like I mentioned to you offline,
I don't, there's something about me that appreciates swinging for the
fences and not dating, like doing serial dating, or dating around.
Like you're a one guy, one girl kind of guy. [Lex] Yeah. And you said
that. And it's tricky because you want to be careful with that kind of
stuff. Especially now there's a growing platform that have a
ridiculous amount of female interests of a certain kind. But I'm
looking for deep connection, and I'm looking by sending home alone,
and every once in a while talking to Stanford professors. Perfect
solution. - On a podcast. Perfect solution. Is going to workout great.
It's well, it's part of, that constitutes machine learning of sorts.
Yeah, of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=9771"&gt;The Lex Fridman Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, you mentioned what has now become a quite extensive and
expansive public platform, which is incredible. I mean, the number of
people out, first time I saw your podcast, I noticed the suit, I was
like, he respects his audience, which was great, but I also thought
this is amazing. People are showing up for science and engineering and
technology information and those discussions and other sorts of
discussions. Now, I do want to talk for a moment about the podcast. So
my two questions about the podcast are, when you started it, did you
have a plan? And regardless of what that answer is, do you know where
you're taking it, or would you like to leave us? I do believe in an
element of surprise is always fun. But what about the podcast? Do you
enjoy the podcast? I mean, your audience certainly includes me, really
enjoys the podcast. It's incredible. So I love talking to people, and
there's something about microphones that really bring out the best in
people. Like you don't get a chance to talk like this. If you and I
were just hanging out, we would have a very different conversation in
the amount of focus we allocate to each other. We would be having fun
talking about other stuff and doing other things. There'll be a lot of
distraction. There would be some phone use and all that kind of stuff.
But here we're 100% focused on each other and focus on the idea. And
like sometimes playing with ideas that we both don't know the answer
to, like a question we don't know the answer to. We're both like
fumbling with it, trying to figure out, trying to get some insights at
something we haven't really figured out before and together arriving
at that. I think that's magical. I don't know why we need microphones
for that, but we somehow do. It feels like doing science. It feels
like doing science for me, definitely. That's exactly it. And I'm
really glad you said that because I don't actually often say this, but
that's exactly what I felt like. I wanted to talk to friends and
colleagues at MIT to do real science together. That's how I felt about
it. Like to really talk through problems that are actually
interesting, as opposed to like incremental work that we're currently
working for for a particular conference. So really asking questions
like, what are we doing? Like, where's this headed to? Like, what are
the big, is this really going to help us solve, in the case of AI,
solve intelligence? Like, is this even working on intelligence?
There's a certain sense, which is why I initially called it artificial
intelligence. Is like most of us are not working on artificial
intelligence. You're working on some very specific problem and a set
of techniques, at the time it's machine learning to solve this
particular problem. This is not going to take us to a system that is
anywhere close to the generalizability of the human mind. Like the
kind of stuff the human mind can do in terms of memory, in terms of
cognition, in terms of reasoning, common sense reasoning. This doesn't
seem to take us there. So the initial impulse was, can I talk to these
folks do science together through conversation? And I also thought
that there was not enough, I didn't think there was enough good
conversations with world-class minds that I got to meet. And not the
ones with the book, or like this was just the thing. Oftentimes you go
on this tour when you have a book, but there's a lot of minds that
don't write books. And the books constrain the conversation too, when
you're talking about this thing, this book. But there's, I've noticed
that, with people that haven't written a book who are brilliant, we
get to talk about ideas in a new way. We both haven't actually, when
we raise a question, we don't know the answer to it once the question
is raised. And we try to arrive there. Like, I dunno, I remember
asking questions of world-class researchers in deep learning of, why
do neural networks work as well as they do? That question is often
loosely asked, but like when you have microphones and you have to
think through it, and you have 30 minutes to an hour to think through
it together, I think that's science. I think that's really powerful.
So that was the one goal. The other one is, again, don't usually talk
about this, but there's some sense in which I wanted to have dangerous
conversations. Part of the reasons I wanted to wear a suit is like, I
want it to be fearless. The reason I don't usually talk about it is
because I feel like I'm not good at conversation. So it looks like it
doesn't match the current skill level. But I wanted to have really
dangerous conversations that I uniquely would be able to do. Not
completely uniquely, but like, I'm a huge fan of Joe Rogan, and I had
to ask myself, what conversations can I do that Joe Rogan can't? For
me, I know I bring this up, but for me that person I thought about at
the time was Putin. Like that's why I bring him up. He's just like
with Costello, he's not just a person. He's also an idea to me for
what I strive for. Just to have those dangerous conversations. And the
reason I'm uniquely qualified as both the Russian, but also there's
the judo and the martial arts, there's a lot of elements that make me
have a conversation he hasn't had before. And there's a few other
people that I kept in mind, like Don Knuth, is a computer scientist
from Stanford that I thought is one of the most beautiful minds ever.
And nobody really talked to him, like really talked to him. He did a
few lectures, which people love, but really just have a conversation
with him. There's a few people like that. One of them passed away,
John Conway, that I never got, we agreed to talk, but he died before
we did. There's a few people like that, that I thought like it's such
a crime to not hear those folks. And I have the unique ability to know
how to purchase a microphone on Amazon and plug it into a device that
records audio and then publish it, which seems relatively unique. Like
that's not easy in the scientific community. People knowing how to
plug in a microphone. No. They can build Faraday cages, and two-photon
microscopes and bioengineer, all sorts of things, but the idea that
you could take ideas and export them into a structure or a pseudo
structure that people would benefit from seems like a cosmic
achievement to them. I don't know if it's fear or just a basically
they haven't tried it, so they haven't learned the skill level. But I
think they're not trained. I mean, we could riff on this for awhile,
but I think that, but it's important. And maybe we should, which is
that it's, they're not trained to do it. They're trained to think in
specific games and specific hypotheses, and many of them don't care
to, right? They became scientists because that's where they felt safe,
and so why would they leave that Haven of safety? Well, they also
don't necessarily always see the value in it. We're all together
learning, you and I are learning the value of this. I think you're
probably having an exceptionally successful and amazing podcast that
you started just recently. Thanks to your encouragement. Well, but
there's a raw skill there that's, you're definitely an inspiration to
me in how you did the podcast in the level of excellence you reach.
But I think you've discovered that that's also an impactful way to do
science. That podcast. And I think a lot of scientists have not yet
discovered that. That this is a, if they apply same kind of rigor as
they do to academic publication or to even conference presentations,
and they do that rigor and effort to podcast, whatever that is, that
could be a five-minute podcast, a two-hour podcasts, it could be
conversational, or it can be more like lecture like, if they apply
that effort, you have the potential to reach over time, tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people. And that's
really, really powerful. But yeah, for me giving a platform to a few
of those folks, especially for me personally, so maybe you can speak
to what fields you're drawn to, but I thought computer scientists were
especially bad at this. So there's brilliant computer scientists that
I thought it would be amazing to explore their mind, explore their
thinking. And so that I took that almost as an, on as an effort. And
at the same time I had other guests in mind, or people that connect to
my own interests. So the wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, both
American football and soccer. I have a few particular people that I'm
really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev. The Saitiev brothers, even
Khabib for wrestling, just to talk to them, 'cause. Oh, 'cause you
can, you guys can communicate In Russian and in wrestling, right? As
wrestlers and as Russians. And so that little, it's like an
opportunity to explore a mind that I'm able to bring to the world. And
also it, I feel like it makes me a better person, just that being that
vulnerable and exploring ideas together. I don't know, like good
conversation. I don't know how often you have really good conversation
with friends, but like podcasts are like that. And it's deeply moving.
It's the best. And what you brought through. I mean, when I saw you
sit down with Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, and these other
folks that, it's not just 'cause he has a Nobel, it's what comes out
of his mouth is incredible. And what you were able to hold in that
conversation was so much better, light years beyond what he had any
other interviewer, I don't want to even call you an interviewer 'cause
it's really about conversation. Light years beyond what anyone else
had been able to engage with him was such a beacon of what's possible.
And I know that, I think that's what people are drawn to. And there's
a certain intimacy, that certainly to people, our friends, as we are,
and they know each other, that there's more of that, but there's an
intimacy in those kinds of private conversations that are made public.
And. Well, that's the, with you, you're probably starting to realize,
and Costello, is like, part of it, because you're authentic and you're
putting yourself out there completely, people are almost not just
consuming the words you're saying, they also enjoy watching you,
Andrew, struggle with these ideas or try to communicate these ideas.
They like the flaws, they like a human being. Oh, good, that flaws.
Well, that's good 'cause I got plenty of those. But they like the
self-critical aspects, like where you're very careful, where you're
very self-critical about your flaws. I mean, in that same way, it's
interesting I think for people to watch me talk to Penrose, not just
because Penrose is communicating ideas, but here's this like silly kid
trying to explore ideas. Like they know this kid. There's a human
connection that is really powerful. Same, I think with Putin, right?
Like it's not just as a good interview with Putin, it's also, here's
this kid struggling to talk with one of the most powerful, some will
argue dangerous people in the world. They love that. The authenticity
that led up to that. And in return, I get to connect, everybody I run
to in the street and all those kinds of things, there's a depth of
connection there, almost within like a minute or two that's unlike any
other. Yeah, there's an intimacy that you've formed with with them.
Yeah, we've been on this like journey together. And yeah, I have the
same thing with Joe Rogan before I ever met him, right? Like I was,
because I was a fan of Joe for so many years, there's something,
there's a kind of friendship as absurd as it might be to say in
podcasting and listening to podcasts. Yeah. Maybe it fills in a little
bit of that or solves a little bit of that loneliness that you've been
talking about earlier. Until the robots are here. [laughing]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=10554"&gt;The Hedgehog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just a couple more questions, but one of them is on behalf of
your audience, which is, I'm not going to ask you the meaning of the
hedgehog, but I just want to know, does it have a name? And you don't
have to tell us the name, but just, does it have a name? Yes or no?
Well, there's a name he likes to be referred to as, and then there's a
private name in the privacy of his own company that we call each
other. No. [Lex laughing] I'm not that insane. No, his name is Hedgy.
He's a hedgehog. I don't like stuffed animals. But his story is one of
minimalism. So I gave away everything I own, now three times in my
life. By everything I mean almost everything, kept jeans and shirt and
a laptop. And recently it's also been guitar, things like that. But he
survived because he was always in, at least in the first two times was
in the laptop bag, and he just got lucky. And so I just liked the
perseverance of that. And I first saw him in the, the reason I got a
stuffed animal, I don't have other stuffed animals, is it was in a
thrift store, in this like giant pile of stuffed animals and he jumped
out at me, because unlike all the rest of them, he has this intense
mean look about him. That he's just, he's upset at life, at the
cruelty of life. And it's just, especially in the contrast of the
other stuffed animals, they have this dumb smile on their face. If you
look at most stuffed animals, they have this dumb look on their face.
They're just happy. Is like "Pleasantville." It's what we say in
neuroscience, they have a smooth cortex, not many form. Exactly. And
this, like Hedgy like saw through all of it. He was like Dustyesky's
man from underground. I mean, there's a sense that he saw the darkness
of the world and persevered. So like, and there's also a famous
Russian cartoon, "Hedgehog in the Fog" that I grew up with, I
connected with. [Lex laughing] People who know of that cartoon, you
could see it on YouTube, it's. "Hedgehog in the Fog." Yeah. [Lex
laughing] It's just, as you would expect, especially from like early
Soviet cartoons. It's a hedgehog, like sad, walking through the fog,
exploring like loneliness and sadness. It's like, but it's beautiful.
It's like a piece of art, people should, even if you don't speak
Russian, you'll see, you'll understand. Oh, the moment you said that I
was going to ask, so it's in Russian? But of course it's in It's in
Russian, but it's more, it's very little speaking in it. It's almost
a, there's an interesting exploration of how you make sense of the
world when you see it only vaguely through the fog. So he's trying to
understand the world. We have Mickey Mouse, we have Bugs Bunny. We
have all these crazy animals, and you have the "Hedgehog in the Fog."
So there's a certain period, and this is again, I don't know what it's
attributed to, but it was really powerful, which there's a period in
Soviet history, I think probably '70s and '80s where like, especially
kids were treated very seriously. Like they were treated like they're
able to deal with the weightiness of life. And that was reflected in
the cartoons. And there was, it was allowed to have like really
artistic content, not like dumb cartoons that are trying to get you to
like smile and run around, but like create art. Like stuff that, you
know how like short cartoons or short films can win Oscars, like
that's what they're swinging for. So what strikes me about this is a
little bit how we were talking about the suit earlier, it's almost
like they treat kids with respect. Yeah. Like that they have an
intelligence and they honor that intelligence. Yeah, they're really
just adult in a small body. Like you want to protect them from the
true cruelty of the world. Sure. But in terms of their intellectual
capacity or like philosophical capacity, they are right there with
you. And so that the cartoons reflected that, the art that they
consumed, education reflected that. So he represents that. I mean,
there's a sense of, because it's survived so long and because I don't
like stuffed animals, that it's like we've been through all of this
together and it's the same, sharing the moments together as the
friendship. And there's a sense in which, if all the world turns on
you and goes to hell, at least we got each other. And he doesn't die,
because he's an inanimate object, so. Until you animate him. Until you
animate him. And then I probably would want to know what he was
thinking about this whole time. He's probably really into Taylor Swift
or something like that. And it's like that I wouldn't even want to
know anyway. Well, I now feel a connection to Hedgy, the hedgehog that
I certainly didn't have before. And I think that encapsulates the kind
of possibility of connection that is possible between human and other
object and through robotics certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRvn3Oj5r3E&amp;amp;t=10877"&gt;Concluding Statements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a saying that I heard when I was a graduate student that's
just been ringing in my mind throughout this conversation in such a, I
think appropriate way, which is that, Lex, you are in a minority of
one, you are truly extraordinary in your ability to encapsulate so
many aspects of science, engineering, public communication, about so
many topics, martial arts and the emotional depth that you bring to
it. And just the purposefulness, and I think if it's not clear to
people, it absolutely should be stated. But I think it's abundantly
clear that just the amount of time and thinking that you put into
things is, it is the ultimate mark of respect. So, I'm just
extraordinarily grateful for your friendship and for this
conversation. I'm proud to be a friend. And I just wished you showed
me the same kind of respect by wearing a suit and make your father
proud maybe next time. [Andrew laughing] Next time indeed. Thanks so
much my friend. Thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you for joining me

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we're going to talk about science-
based protocols for sleep, mood, learning, nutrition, exercise of
various kinds, strength and endurance, and hypertrophy, and we are
going to talk about some protocols that relate to creativity. We're
going to talk about behavioral protocols, supplement based protocols,
all science backed by quality, peer-reviewed literature. The reason
that we're holding this episode now is that in the recent previous
episodes, we've covered some pretty intense and in-depth topics. We've
talked about vision and how we see and how to get better at seeing and
how to maintain vision. We've talked about hearing and balance. We've
talked about chemical sensing. And we had a guest episode that covered
a lot of information about new and emerging technologies in
neuroscience, as well as mental health. That was the interview episode
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth. So given that we've covered so much detailed
information in the previous 27 episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, I
decided that we would hold office hours. Office hours in the
university setting are when students come to the professor's office or
you meet outdoors on campus or in the classroom to review the material
and questions from lecture in more detail. Now, unfortunately, we
don't have the opportunity to meet face to face in real life, but
nonetheless, you've been sending your questions, putting them in the
comment section on YouTube, et cetera, and I prepared a number of
answers to the questions that have shown up most frequently. Now, in
order to provide context and structure to the way that we will address
these questions, I've arranged the science and science-based protocols
that relate to various aspects of life such as mood, exercise, sleep,
waking, anxiety, creativity, et cetera into the context of a day.
Selecting the unit of a day in order to deliver this science
information and protocols is not a haphazard decision on my part. It's
actually the case that every cell in our body, every organ in our
body, and our brain is modulating or changes across the 24 hour a day
in a very regular and predictable rhythm. And it's no coincidence that
the Earth spins once on its axis every 24 hours. These two things are
coordinated by virtue of genes and different proteins and things that
are expressed in every cell of your body. And so selecting the unit of
the day is not just a practical one, but it's one that's related to
our deeper biology. You may have heard in my interview episode with
Dr. Karl Deisseroth that he himself, in order to juggle a tremendous
workload, a full-time clinical practice, a lab of 40 plus people, a
family of five children, et cetera, breaks up his life into units of
days. And so today we are going to further dissect the day as a unit
that one can manage and manage extremely well, and, in fact, can
optimize. So we're basically going to talk about how to leverage
science-based protocols. And when I say science, I mean, quality,
peer-reviewed science published in excellent journals. We're going to
talk about how to take that science, convert it into specific
protocols that break up along the course of a single day and direct
certain types of behaviors in order to optimize the various features
of life. I will couch this in the context of what I do across a daily
24-hour rhythm. That doesn't mean that you have to follow this
schedule at all or even in part. It's just by way of example. Any
number of the different things that I describe could be applied to any
number of different schedules or frameworks. But if there's one truth
that applies to all of us, is that we all have to exist within the
context of this 24 hour rhythm that we all possess. So that's what
we'll focus on. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this
podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to
consumer information about science and science-related tools to the
general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes
eyeglasses and sunglasses that I believe are the very highest quality
possible. Developed by two All-American swimmers from Stanford, ROKA
sunglasses and eyeglasses were developed with their intention to
create sunglasses and eyeglasses that could be worn anywhere. So while
exercising or while working, at home, while driving. The reason I like
ROKA glasses so much is that first of all, they're extremely
lightweight. The optical clarity of the lenses is excellent, and so I
often just forget that I have even have them on. When I'm outside and
I'm wearing sunglasses, they have this really terrific feature which
is that I can move in and out of shadows or the cloud cover can change
and I can see perfectly well the entire time. You know, many
eyeglasses and sunglasses that I've tried, depending on what we call
the "ambient lighting conditions," the local lighting conditions
outside, I have to take them off or put them back on. It's really
annoying for me. But with ROKA glasses, somehow, I'm assuming because
they really understand the science of the visual system, the
eyeglasses and sunglasses work seamlessly with whatever environment
you're in. So that's absolutely terrific. Another thing about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses is that their aesthetic is really terrific.
You know, I don't think I'm alone in saying that many performance
glasses as they're called end up making people look like a cyborg, but
the sunglasses are of the sort that, you know, you can wear while
running or biking or driving or out to dinner. I don't typically wear
sunglasses while out to dinner, but you get the idea. You can wear
them anywhere and they look very natural. They have a huge number of
different styles to select from. If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,
you can go to ROKA, that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code huberman to

InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that
analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand
your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a
believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health
can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. With InsideTracker, it
alleviates a specific problem that's associated with most, if not all,
of the other blood tests and DNA tests out there. And that problem is
you get information back about the levels of various things, metabolic
factors, hormones, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that
information. With InsideTracker, they have this terrific dashboard
that allows you to both see your levels of hormones, metabolic
factors, and the rest, but also, it suggests specific things that you
can do with your nutrition, your exercise, and lifestyle, and so forth
in order to bring those levels into the ranges that are best for your
immediate and long-term health. In addition, they make the whole
process of getting your blood and DNA taken very easy. They'll even
come to your home to take the sample. If you'd like to try
InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do

to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that
are ideally matched your sleep needs. I started sleeping on a Helix
mattress about eight months ago, and I can honestly say it's the best
sleep that I've ever had in my entire life. And that's because the
mattress was actually designed for me. And you can have a mattress
designed for you. If you go to helixsleep.com, they have this free,
very brief, two-minute quiz that asks you a number of questions like
do you sleep on your side or your back? Do you tend to run warm while
you sleep or do you tend to get cold in the middle of the night? Maybe
you don't know the answers to those questions, and that's fine too.
After taking that quiz, they will match you to a specific mattress
that's ideal for your sleep needs. I matched to the so-called "Dusk
Mattress," D-U-S-K, because I wanted a mattress that was not too firm,
not too soft. As I mentioned, I absolutely love it. If you're
interested in upgrading your mattress, you can go to
helixsleep.com/huberman, take their two-minute sleep quiz, and they'll
match you to a customized mattress and you'll get up to $200 off your
mattress order and two free pillows. They also make these terrific
pillows. They have a 10-year warranty and you get to try out the
mattress for 100 nights risk free. If you don't like it, they'll come
pick it up and they'll take it away, but I think you'll love it. I
certainly love mine. Again, if you're interested, you can go to
helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=530"&gt;Protocol 1: Record Your Daily Waking Time &amp;amp; Temperature Minimum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about how to apply quality, peer-reviewed science to
your day and how to optimize everything from sleep to learning,
creativity, meal timing, et cetera. As I mentioned earlier, I'm going
to do this in the context of my day and what I typically do. However,
the specific protocols for any number of different things, sleep,
relaxation, meal timing, exercise, et cetera, any one or all of those
could be rearranged to suit your specific needs. I'm going to tell you
what I do from morning until waking and even what I do while I sleep
in order to optimize my sleep. So let's start with getting up in the
morning. Now, for me, I tend to wake up sometime around 6:00 AM, 6:30,
sometimes as late as 7:00 AM. I don't typically sleep much later than
7:00 AM. The first thing I do after I wake up is I take the pen that's
on my nightstand and the pad of paper on my nightstand and I write
down the time in which I woke up. Now, I do sleep with my phone in my
room. I realized this is considered a sin and has certain hazards
associated with it, but I put my phone on airplane mode about an hour
before I go to sleep. And then I set my alarm typically for 6:30 AM.
And some days the alarm wakes me up; other days I wake up before the
alarm. And yes, some days the alarm goes off and I hit snooze a few
times, and then usually by 7:00 AM, I am up and out of bed. The reason
for writing down what time I wake up is because I want to know that
average wake up time. That average wake up time informs what's called
my "temperature minimum." It tells me when my body temperature was
lowest. The temperature minimum is the time in each 24-hour cycle that
your body temperature is lowest. I don't sleep with a thermometer in
my mouth or elsewhere, and I don't think you should either. Instead, I
know that the lowest temperature that my body will be at across the
24-hour cycle tends to be two hours before my typical wake up time.
And I want to know that number. It's called our "temperature minimum."
So if you're somebody that typically wakes up at 8:00 AM, then your
temperature minimum is sometime around 6:00 AM. Remember, the
temperature minimum is a time in the 24-hour cycle. I don't care what
my actual temperature is; I care when my lowest temperature is. And I
know that that lowest temperature is approximately two hours before my
average wake-up time. So I highly recommend that you write down when
you wake up or track that in some way that works for you and use that
as a reference point to determine your temperature minimum. We will
return to the temperature minimum and how you can leverage the
temperature minimum for several things: shifting your clock, shifting
your circadian sleep schedule and wake schedule. Also for shifting
your eating schedule, et cetera, We will return to that. But even if
you don't travel, even if you don't care about things like jet lag,
even if you sleep fabulously all year round, never have a poor night's
sleep, knowing your temperature minimum, that time when your
temperature is at its lowest point, is a valuable thing to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=727"&gt;Protocol 2: Self-Generate Forward Motion (Outdoors)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing I do after I wake up is to get into forward
ambulation, which is just nerd speak for taking a walk. I have a dog,
and as many of you know, he's a bulldog and he doesn't really like to
walk, especially not in the morning. But for humans and for animals,
there's a phenomenon whereby when we generate our own forward motion,
forward ambulation, visual images pass by us on our eyes, so-called
"optic flow." And for those of you that are low vision or no vision,
the same phenomenon occurs in the auditory system. Sounds pass by us
in so-called "auditory flow." Getting into a mode of forward
ambulation, and especially experiencing visual flow, has a powerful
effect on the nervous system. The effect it has is essentially to
quiet or reduce the amount of neural activity in this brain structure
called the "amygdala." Amygdala means "almond," and many of you have
probably heard about the amygdala for its role in anxiety and fear and
threat detection. And indeed, the amygdala is part of the network in
the brain that generates feelings of fear and threat and anxiety. It
does a bunch of other things too, but that's one of its primary
functions. There are now at least half a dozen quality papers
published in quality, peer-reviewed journals that show that forward
ambulation, walking or biking or running, in generating optic flow in
particular has this incredible property of lowering activity in the
amygdala and thereby reducing levels of anxiety. There are two papers
that I'd like to highlight in particular that relate to this
phenomenon. The first one was published in the journal Neuron and the
title of this paper is "Whole-Brain Functional Ultrasound Imaging,"
that just means they have a cool technique to evaluate the activity of
structures in the brain across the entire brain, reveals brain modules
for visual motor integration. What they found in this study, and I
should mention the first author is Mace, this comes from Botond
Roska's group, this was work done in mice, but I'll talk about other
species in a moment. What they found was essentially that when these
mice walk forward and their eyes move from side to side, which is a
natural consequence of moving forward, so-called "optic flow" is
flowing past their eyes, many brain areas are activated, increase in
their level of firing, but the amygdala in particular reduced its
levels of firing. That's a very interesting finding, but it is in
mice. However, another paper, "Eye-Movement Intervention Enhances
Extinction via Amygdala Deactivation," was published in The Journal of
Neuroscience, a strong journal, and shows that, again, these eye
movements, these lateral eye movements from side to side reduce
activity levels in this fear/threat/anxiety center in the brain, the
amygdala. Now, those are eye movements. They didn't specifically look
at forward ambulation. And yet other papers have looked at forward
ambulation and we know that forward ambulation, walking forward,
generates the sorts of eye movements that cause optic flow and
reductions in amygdala activation. So for me, this process of taking a
walk each morning isn't about exercise. It's not about burning
calories. It's not about any of that. It's really about getting into
optic flow and reducing the levels of amygdala activation. Now, I
don't have anxiety, at least I don't have chronic anxiety or
generalized anxiety. I tend to have a lot of energy, but at these
points in the morning, I'm not very energetic. Sometimes I'm sort of
shuffling more than I'm walking in fact. And Costello is almost always
shuffling and I'm almost always trying to drag him first thing in the
morning. But that walk is a particularly important protocol each day
because it really serves to push my neurology in the direction that
I'd like it to go, which is alert, but not anxious. And it's kind of a
fine line sometimes, especially as events surface throughout the day,
emails come in, text messages come in, get bombarded with a number of
things. I want to be alert and responsive. I want to be able to focus,
but I don't want to. feel anxious or reactive to these things. So the
forward ambulation and this optic flow is the way that I ensure, based
on quality, peer-reviewed data, that my amygdala activation is
slightly suppressed. Now, at the same time, I also want the alertness.
I want alert and focused. I don't just want to be sleepy or super,
super relaxed. I want to have a high degree of focus and alertness
because I'm soon going to move into a about of work. I need to lean
into the day. So in order to do that, I make sure that the walking is
done outdoors. That might be sort of a duh, but many people get up and
start moving around their house, their apartment, and they don't go
anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=1020"&gt;Protocol 3: View Natural Light For 10-30min Every Morning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just walking around inside, it will generate some optic flow, but
nothing like the sort of optic flow that you can generate in larger
environments like out of doors environments. If you can't get
outdoors, doing it indoors is perfectly fine, but it's not going to
have the same magnitude of positive effect. Now, in order to get the
alertness, I do it outdoors because I also want sunlight in my eyes. I
know many of you have heard me talk about this ad nauseam on various
podcasts, in this podcast, but getting sunlight in your eyes first
thing in the morning is absolutely vital to mental and physical
health. It is perhaps the most important thing that any and all of us
can and should do in order to promote metabolic well-being, promote
the positive functioning of your hormone system, get your mental
health steering in the right direction. There are a number of reasons
for this, but before I get into those reasons, let me just emphasize
what the protocol is. The protocol is get outdoors, ideally with no
sunglasses if you can do that safely, even if there's cloud cover.
More photons, light information are coming through that cloud cover
than would be coming from a very bright indoor bulb. So getting
outdoors is absolutely key. How long should you do this? It's going to
depend on the brightness of the environment. It's going to depend on a
number of different factors. Two minutes would be a minimum, 10
minutes would be even better, and if you can, 30 minutes would be
fantastic. Now, it's a very bright day or, you know, you live in a
place where there's bright sunlight, clear day on a snowfield, you
would only need something like 60 seconds. But most people aren't
living in those sorts of conditions. So getting outside for a
10-minute walk or a 15-minute walk will basically ensure that you're
getting adequate stimulation of these neurons in the eye that are
called the "melanopsin," intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.
I know that's a mouthful. These are neurons that don't care about
shapes of objects or the motion of objects. These are neurons that
convey to the brain that it's daytime and it's time to be alert. And
it sets in motion a huge number of biological cascades within every
cell and organ of your body from your liver to your gut, to your
heart, to your brain. It really sets things down the right path. Early
in the day, we experience a natural and healthy bump in a hormone
called "cortisol." Cortisol comes from the amygdala. That cortisol, as
I mentioned, is healthy and normal and promotes wakefulness. It
actually promotes a healthy immune system. So I know you've heard that
stress and cortisol disrupt the immune system, but not the short
little pulse of cortisol that you get each morning. It's very
important that that pulse of cortisol arrive early in the day. I want
to emphasize this again. It's very important that that pulse of
cortisol arrive early in the day And that pulse of cortisol is going
to happen once every 24 hours no matter what. It's going to happen and
you get to time it. How do you time it? Primarily by when you view
bright sunlight or bright light of another kind, and we'll talk about
that in a moment. So you want that cortisol pushed early. If you wake
up before the sun comes out, it's fine to turn on artificial lights,
but then you would want to get outside as soon as you can to get this,
excuse me, natural light stimulation of your eyes. And it does have to
be to your eyes. Just to really drill down into the details for a
moment, you don't want to stare directly at the sun or any light
that's so bright that it feels painful. If you feel like you have to
close your eyes or blink, please do. You don't want to damage your
retinas. The point here is to get the sunlight indirectly. It's going
to essentially be scattered everywhere through the cloud cover, but
you know from looking at us at a flashlight directly into that
flashlight versus looking at the beam that flashlight generates on the
ground that if you're standing in the shade, you're going to. get less
of that sunlight than you are if you're out in an open field. So this
is why the time outside, it's going to need to vary depending on your
particular environment. But do your best to do this every day. If you
miss a day, no big deal, but try not to miss more than one day.
Otherwise your mental and physical health will start to suffer. And
doing this each day costs nothing. It's just time You can combine it
with the forward ambulation with the walk and the optic flow that I
talked about before. And that's what I do each morning to generate a
sense of alertness in my body and brain to generate a sense of calm,
yet alert. And that's also what I do with Costello, with my bulldog.
People have asked me, do the same mechanisms apply to animals? Well,
the reality is many of these mechanisms were actually discovered in
animals, and then were tested in humans and verified that they also
exist in humans. Not always. Sometimes it was the reverse, where they
were tested first in humans, and then brought to animals. But indeed,
your dog, your horse, you know, I don't know what other animals are
out there, they need this. Now, if you have a hamster or a nocturnal
animal, the reason why they like to run on their wheels at night is
because they're nocturnal. They don't like being in the light. Light
actually causes them to freeze, right? Actually, if you are into
aquaria, you like fish, they always say, "Don't overfeed your fish.
You'll kill the fish." That's true, but guess what the fastest way to
kill a fish is? To keep the lights on 24 hours a day They also need
circadian rhythms, these 24-hour rhythms. So we'll do an entire month
at some point about pet health, but meanwhile, get that morning
sunlight. So now we have a first protocol, which is to write down the
time of day that you wake up, the second protocol is to take a walk
first thing in the morning, and the third protocol is woven in with
that walk, at least for me, which is to get that sunlight exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=1363"&gt;What To Do If You Can’t View The Sun: Blue Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you can't get sunlight exposure, you absolutely can't, I don't
necessarily recommend buying one of these dawn alarm lights. And I'm
sorry to say this, but they're just vastly overpriced relative to what
they are. They're basically a bright LED. I instead use, I have a pad
that's a 930-lux LightPad. I think it was designed for drawing. Those
are available at a fraction of the cost that a morning light simulator
would provide, and yet it's really bright enough, at least for me. I
tend to put it on my desk while I work each morning. So here's a
principle that you can leverage. If you want to be alert, view bright
lights and make those lights above you or in front of you. If you want
to go to sleep soon or you don't want to be awake for whatever reason,
try and eliminate your exposure to light. And this, again, is not
about exposure of the skin to light; this is about exposure of your
eyes, of your neural retinas to light. For those of you that are
concerned about blue light, I want to that blue light is precisely the
wavelength of light that is optimal for stimulating these neurons in
your eye, which set your circadian rhythms properly. So you don't want
to shield yourself from blue light early in the day or throughout the
day or anytime you want to be awake. In fact, that could have a number
of detrimental consequences. Fortunately, all those consequences are
going to be reversible after a short period of time of making sure
that you don't wear your blue blockers during the day, please. The
time to wear blue blockers, if you do, is at night and in the evening
when you're headed towards sleep. My colleague Samer Hattar, who is
head of the chronobiology unit at the National Institute of Mental
Health, has spoken about this before on my Instagram. We held an
Instagram Live and I said, "Samer, what do you think about blue
blockers?" And he said, "I don't think that's a good idea at all,
unless it's really late at night and you're in a bright environment
and you're trying to limit the amount of bright light that impacts the
eyes." Eliminating specific wavelengths of light, in Samer's opinion
and also in my opinion, is not a natural thing for the visual system
and the brain to experience. Some people get headaches while they work
on the computer all day or staring at screens, and so they get blue
blockers thinking that's going to protect them from their headaches.
However, any protection that you get from headaches from blue blockers
is going to be minimal in comparison to what's really going on there,
which is that people are viewing devices and screens up close for too
many hours throughout the 24-hour cycle. A better remedy would be to
step away from that computer from time to time, and to make sure that
you can look far off into the distance. Ideally, a distance longer
than 20 feet like view a horizon, go out on a balcony, things of that
sort. Take a walk around, get into optic flow So if you're into blue
blockers, make sure you're only wearing them in the late evening and
at night. I personally don't wear blue blockers at all. I prefer to
just control my light viewing behavior by doing this, I do the other
form of circadian control, which is to dim the lights. And I do that
because dimming the lights and setting them lower in the environment
sets up the brain and body for sleep much better than simply just
wearing some blue light blue blockers, excuse me. And please know if
you do wear blue blockers that if the light in your environment is
bright enough, it doesn't matter if you're blocking out the blues. The
cells in the eye will respond to other wavelengths of light. So I have
no vendetta against the blue blockers, and, you know, I fully expect
the blue block-anistas to come after me with, I guess, blue blockers,
but as you do that, please understand that the biology points in the
direction of get a lot of bright light throughout the day, including
blue light, and at night, just limit the total amount of overall light
that you're exposed to, including from screens. So then Costello and I
get back from our walk. Sometimes that walk was 10 minutes, sometimes
it was 60 minutes, depending on how slowly Costello is walking that
day. Indeed, many mornings I'm the guy carrying his bulldog back up
the hill. My neighbors know me so well, they know Costello so well
that they've since stopped pulling over and asking if the dog is okay.
Sometimes they'll ask if I'm okay. Nonetheless, we get back, I give
him his food, I give him his water, and I give me my water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=1610"&gt;Protocol 4: Hydrate Correctly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a big believer, based on quality, peer-reviewed data, that
hydration is essential for mental performance. Now, I confess I don't
really like drinking big glasses or big jugs of water first thing in
the morning. I don't know why, but my thirst doesn't tend to kick in
first thing. You may be different. Either way, I force myself,
essentially, to drink at least 16 and, most days, 32 ounces of water.
I also put a little bit of sea salt in the water. As many of you know,
neurons require ionic flow. What that means is neurons need sodium,
they need magnesium, and they need potassium in order to function. We
do tend to get dehydrated at night. Even if the day is not very hot, I
try and top off or I try and make sure that I'm hydrated early in the
day before I begin any work. So I make myself drink this water with a
little bit of sea salt. How much sea salt? If you really want to get
detailed, I suppose it's about half a teaspoon. It's not much, That's
what I do. And I drink that more or less room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=1680"&gt;Protocol 5: Delay Caffeine 90-120m After Waking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that drinking really cold water first thing in the day kind of
like cramps up my insides, so I don't do that. At that point, I start
thinking about and fantasizing about and craving caffeine, but I don't
drink that caffeine yet. I purposely delay my caffeine intake to 90
minutes to 120 minutes after I wake up. Of course, I know when I wake
up 'cause I wrote it down, although it's pretty easy to commit to
memory. The reason I delay caffeine is because one of the factors that
induces a sense of sleepiness is the buildup of adenosine or, as some
people call it, adenosine in our system. The buildup of adenosine
accumulates the longer we are awake. So when I wake up in the morning,
when you wake up in the morning, your adenosine levels are likely to
be very low. However, caffeine is an adenosine blocker. It's actually
a competitive antagonist for you aficionados. It sort of parks in the
receptor that adenosine normally would park at and prevents adenosine
from acting on that receptor. That's why you feel more alert, because
it's essentially blocking the effect of this sleepiness factor that we
all create called the "adenosine." The reason for delaying caffeine
intake 90 minutes to two hours after waking is I want to make sure
that I don't have a late afternoon or even early afternoon crash from
caffeine. One of the best ways to ensure a caffeine crash is to drink
a bunch of caffeine, block all those adenosine receptors, and then by
early or late afternoon, when that caffeine starts to wear off and
gets dislodged from the receptors, a lower level of adenosine is able
to create a greater level of sleepiness. It took me years to figure
this out. I used to wake up and I'd think, "Oh, I don't want to drink
caffeine too close to bedtime, so I'm going to start drinking my
caffeine really early." I let my cortisol naturally come up in the
morning. I avoid drinking caffeine until about 90 minutes or two hours
after waking. And when I do that, I find that I don't experience the
afternoon crash. At least I don't experience that crash unless I do
something foolish, like ingest far too much food at lunch or I stay up
all night the night before. But provided I don't do anything foolish
like that, delaying caffeine to 90 minutes to two hours optimizes this
relationship between adenosine and wakefulness and sleepiness in a way
that really provides a nice, consistent arc of energy throughout the
day and brings energy down as I'm headed toward sleep and falling
asleep. My primary objective early in the day is to get into a mode of
being focused, yet alert so that I can get work done. I found that the
best way for me to achieve that state is through fasting. So I don't
eat anything until about 11:00 AM or 12:00 noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=1848"&gt;Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Until Noon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not absolutely religious about it. There are days when I'll have a
few Brazil nuts or a spoonful or three of almond butter, for instance,
but most days I'm not doing that. I'm just not eating anything. I'm
drinking some caffeine caffeine source for me is yerba mate, guayusa
tea. Those are my preferred sources I tend to avoid coffee these days.
Occasionally I'll have a cup, but most often I stick to the teas. I
drink water as much as I feel I need to and want to. And I also drink
my athletic greens, which is compatible at least for me with fasting.
Let's talk about why fasting works to create this heightened state of
alertness, yet calm brain state. Fasting increases levels of
adrenaline, also called "epinephrin" in the brain and body. And when
our levels of epinephrin and adrenaline are increased, we learn
better, we can focus better. There's terrific data supporting that.
You don't want epinephrine, aka adrenaline, too high. That feels like
stress and panic. You get jittery, you can't focus. But in its optimal
range, adrenaline really provides a heightened sense of focus and the
ability to encode, meaning bring in, and retain, remember information.
And so since my job is mainly a cerebral one where I'm writing grants
and working on papers, et cetera, I fast in the early part of the day.
I mentioned ingesting things like guayusa or yerba mate or, in my
case, athletic greens. Many people ask, in fact there's a whole
community and discussion boards, et cetera, and YouTube comments on
the internet, about what breaks a fast and what doesn't. The fact of
the matter is that's going&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=1950"&gt;What Actually Breaks A Fast &amp;amp; What Doesn’t?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to be highly individual because it's going to depend on how sensitive
your blood sugar. And more accurately, it's going to depend on things
like your insulin sensitivity. So for instance, if you're somebody who
gets up in the morning, hydrates, and goes out for a six-mile run, you
could probably eat a jar of almond butter and still be what's called
fat-fasted. Your insulin levels will still be very low because even
though that is a large volume of almond butter, even to me and
Costello, that large number of calories comes from a source that
doesn't increase blood sugar very much and insulin very much. Now, I'm
not suggesting you do that, but what I just described as a vastly
different situation than somebody that ate their last meal at 2:00 AM,
and that meal was essentially a feast. And for that person, fasting
until 10:00 or 11:00 AM, their blood sugar might still actually be
pretty high or even lowish such that they might eat one almond and it
would bump them out of fasting. So you get the idea. It's going to
depend on your recent eating history, your blood sugar history, your
glycogen stores, et cetera. So if anyone tells you that breaks a fast
or that doesn't, that's kind of silly. Would one grain of sugar break
your fast? No. Would an entire tablespoon of sugar break your fast?
Yes. You'll get a big blip in blood sugar and insulin from that.
However, how long that lasts, how long it breaks your fast will depend
on how glycogen-depleted you are and a number of other factors. So for
me, I just keep it fairly simple: I ingest water, caffeine from your
yerba mate and guayusa, and I drink my athletic greens with some lemon
juice in it. That constitutes my fasting. And there are days when I do
all those things. There are days when I do none of those things.
Although most days, I would say about 355 days out of the year, I'm
ingesting water, caffeine, and athletic greens during this period of
fasting early in the day, and that's the period of time when I do my
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=2070"&gt;Fat Loss &amp;amp; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP1), Yerba Mate, Guayusa Tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting fact about yerba mate and guayusa teas is that they
increase release of something called "GLP-1." GLP-1 is related to
glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that you can sort of think about as
opposite to insulin and blood sugar. It's more complex than that, but
GLP-1 has a couple of positive properties. One is it increases
lipolysis and mobilization of body fat stores, so burning of fat. In
fact, there are now a number of clinical trials that are achieving
good success and there are drugs out there only available by
prescription which mimic GLP-1 and are being used to treat, quite
successfully, certain types of diabetes and obesity. Now, I'm not
diabetic, nor am I trying to shed a ton of body fat, but I figure as
long as I'm fasting and as long as I like yerba mate and guayusa,
which I do, they're delicious, I'll tell you which type I use in a
moment, I might as well increase my GLP-1 because it's probably not as
good as getting out and doing some cardio work. But nonetheless, if
I'm fasted, increasing GLP-1 in my system, I'm going to be alert from
the caffeine, the adrenaline, et cetera, and I'm going to burning body
fat while I'm doing my work. So for me, it's just an efficient,
biochemically rational, or I should say grounded in quality
biochemistry sort of approach. Yerba mate comes in a lot of different
forms. There are a lot of different brands out there, et cetera. I
don't have any relationship whatsoever in a business sense to any of
these brands. Some of them are very smoky. I, just because of
something in my genetic makeup, or I don't know, maybe it was some
sort of Y chromosome-associated lesion early in life, but I don't like
smoky flavors. So I'm not a Gouda cheese guy. I don't like smoky
stuff. You may love it, but I tend to avoid smoky-tasting mates.
Instead, there's a particular brand that I just found on the internet
called Anna Park. I don't know Anna, I don't know if she has a park,
and I certainly don't know what Anna Park is, but for me, that's the
best-tasting yerba mate. Again, I don't have any relationship to them,
but it's affordable in the context of yerba mate and it's the one that
I use. And I should mention along the lines of affordability and GLP-1
is there's a nice feature of yerba mate which is if you put it in a
filter or a metal strainer and you pour hot water over it, and then
drink it, keep the leaves. The yerba mate leaves can be used over and
over again. It seems that the GLP-1 stimulating aspects of yerba mate
actually are enhanced with subsequent pour overs. So there's something
interesting about these teas that my tea aficionado friends tell me
allows the tea to release more of some of the beneficial compounds by
reusing the tea leaves. Now, eventually it'll grow mold and other
sorts of disgusting things. You don't really want to run that
experiment. I would say you can use it for a day or two before it
starts to go bad, but that's a feature that will extend the life of
whatever yerba mate you happen to use if you decide to use it, and
that's certainly what I do. Next, I want to talk about what I'm doing
while I'm drinking all this yerba mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=2250"&gt;Protocol 7: Optimize Deep Work: Visual Elevation, Ultradian Cycles, White Noise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Cause I'm not just sitting there thinking about all the GLP-1
circulating in my system. I'm working. A couple of things for
optimizing workspace that are grounded in neuroscience and physiology.
I've talked before about the fact that when our eyes are directed
upward, literally when our eyelids are open, no surprise there, and
when our eyes are directed upward, it creates a state of heightened
alertness. And this has a relationship to the brainstem neurons that
create alertness and their control over the muscles of the eye and,
believe it or not, the eyelids. Now, it's not the case that if you are
absolutely exhausted and you need to feel more alert that looking
upward is going to make you feel wide awake, although it will help
support your levels of alertness. The point here is that you can
optimize your workstation in a physical way that leverages this aspect
of the visual system and your level of alertness. Since most of us
want to be awake while we're working, try and position your screen or
your tablet, whatever device you happen to be working on, at least at
eye level and ideally slightly higher. Now, if you think about it,
most people are not doing this. Most people are looking down at their
computer or tablet or are angling their eyes at their screen at about
30 degrees. That is not going to support heightened states of
alertness and optimal attention. In fact, the opposite relationship
between eye position and alertness is also true. When we look down,
when our eyelids are slightly closed, it tends to decrease our levels
of alertness and increase our levels of sleepiness. I really want to
emphasize this, that there's a bi-directional or reciprocal
relationship between the brainstem areas that control alertness and
the eyes, meaning how alert you are controls how open or closed your
eyes are, no surprise there, but also the how open and upward directed
your eyes are will increase your levels of alertness And if your eyes
are pointed downward and your eyelids are hooded, like they're slowly
closing, like Costello's are always are, you'll feel more sleepy,
especially if you're somebody who tends to have that mid-morning
sleepiness or mid-morning crash. So what I do is I have a standing
desk, but I also prop the computer up such that it's at least at eye
level. And I haven't figured out yet how to develop a workstation
where the computer is above me. I think the only way to really do that
is actually to tilt one's body back, but actually that's not a good
idea either. They have done studies recording from areas of the brain
associated with alertness. Areas like locus coeruleus in the so-called
reticular activating system. What they found is that depending on how
reclined you are or upright you are, you will decrease with reclining
and increase with sitting forward your levels of alertness. So body
posture and whether or not your upright or reclining will impact your
levels of alertness in the predictable ways. And where you position
your eyes, whether or not your eyes are upright, so to speak, looking
up or directly forward or looking down, will dictate whether or not
you are feeling more alert or more sleepy, respectively. So try and
arrange a workstation or a position of your body in your chair or your
standing desk, whatever it is, that allows you to work with a
heightened state of alertness. This is really, really key for me
because I found that when I would sit down, not only would my hip
flexors start to get sore, I feel tight in the back, et cetera, but if
I was staring down at my screen all day or even for short periods of
the day, I would start to feel sleepy and I couldn't figure out what
was going on. I also thought maybe I needed glasses. I do wear readers
at night, but it was really a problem. And simply by getting the
screen directly in front of me at eye level, it's been completely
transformative. So we're now at the description of my day in these
protocols in which I would do a 90-minute about of work. Now, why 90
minutes? Well, the brain is going through these 90 minutes so-called
"ultradian cycles" throughout the entire day and night. Every 90
minutes, we shift over from being very alert to being less alert, and
then back to alert again. Here's how it works. At the start of one of
these 90 minute ultradian cycles, my brain is not quite engaged in
whatever it is I'm trying to do. Oftentimes I have things jumping into
my mind, I've got distractions, et cetera. I'll talk about how to deal
with those distractions in a moment. But I set a timer for 90 minutes
and I try and get a strong about of work done inside of that 90
minutes with the full understanding that the entire 90 minutes is not
going to be uniform in terms of my ability to focus. There will be
kind of peaks and valleys within that, but that 90 minutes is about
what the brain can handle in terms of a dedicated effort for high
degree of focus. Some people can push out a little bit further, some
people can't handle more than 10 minutes, but that's what I'm striving
toward. You'd be amazed how much you can get done in 90 minutes if you
are focused. So how do you increase that focus and how do you use the
timer feature? Well, you can combine those. I use a program called
Freedom. It shuts me out of the internet completely. So that means no
checking the markets, no checking social media, no checking, you know,
the news, no checking email, none of that. I get a dedicated about of
work done. I confess, I don't allow myself to go to the restroom in
that period of time. Here's an interesting little tip that's grounded
in physiology. You have a direct neural connection from your bladder
to your brainstem areas that increase alertness. This is why when you
have to go to the bathroom, when you have to urinate, it is extremely
agitating, right? It can be very, very agitating. I'm not encouraging
you to get so agitated by filling your bladder so much and resisting
going to the bathroom that you are uncomfortable and can't focus, but
I generally will just drink liquids and work away and work away, and I
won't walk away to go use the bathroom unless I absolutely have to.
Sort of odd that we're talking about this, but this is one way in
which I've learned to funnel my attention into whatever it is I'm
doing. Because as you all know, the moment you sit down to do some
serious work and you flip off the internet, all of a sudden it's as if
the phone has a voice, it starts calling you.. It's almost as if the
restroom has a voice. But we all are familiar with the fact that if we
are focused on something that all that just kind of melts away. So the
goal is to get into what I call the tunnel, to really get into a
tunnel of quality work. The brain loves that state, but it's very hard
for many of us to access. My phone is absolutely off. It's not on
airplane mode. It's absolutely off during this time. If I've been
struggling with that and, I confess, you know, there are times when,
for whatever reason, something going on in life, it's been harder to
put away the phone. I will sometimes put it in my car. I used to joke
that I used to throw it up on the roof or something like that. Look,
I've done and I suggest people do whatever they need to in order to
self-regulate that activity. And if you're somebody that feels that
you absolutely need to be on your phone and on the computer for this
work about or the work that you do, well, that's a different matter
altogether. This is just simply how I work. So I will do 90 minutes
and I do set a timer and I turn on the program, Freedom locks me out
of the internet. If someone rings the doorbell, I will often shout,
"Not coming to the doorbell. Leave it there." I mean, unless there's a
real emergency, I'm not going to step away from that work. I learned
how to do this when I was a graduate student under different
conditions where I used to slice brains on what's called a microtome.
So I used to spend time, just cutting very thin slices, it's like a
deli slicer, but for a brain, of various types of brains. And I've
sectioned through a lot of brains. And we had a rule, which is that
when the blade hits the brain, you don't stop pulling, even though
it's very, very slow even if a nuclear bomb goes off, even if a fire
alarm goes off. Now, I don't want anyone, you know, burning to a crisp
because they didn't step away from their workflow. That would be
foolish, but that's the mentality that I've embedded in myself, that
there's nothing more important than what I'm doing in that 90-minute
block. And that's what works for me. You can try various other things.
That's what works for me. In addition, I use low level white noise.
This is something that is supported by quality, peer-reviewed data. We
covered this on the episode on hearing and balance, but it turns out
that white noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound, or
all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, mixed up kind of
randomly, there's no structure to it, turned on at a low volume, not
with headphones most of the time, puts the brain into a state that's
optimal for learning and workflow. And I covered two papers during
that episode. One that showed that, indeed, brain areas involved in
attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory,
those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of
white noise playing in the background. The other paper that's really
interesting did brain imaging and showed the areas of the brain that
are associated with dopamine release are increased by low levels of
white noise. Dopamine release is associated not just with pleasure,
but with motivation and craving. So everything about this 90-minute
block from the low levels of white noise to the position of my
computer, how I'm standing, where my eyes are positioned, is geared
towards putting me in this tunnel of work. And I have to say that
while it can be a challenge to try and achieve this state in this
tunnel of work some days, you start to get kind of addicted to it. It
feels really good. It's like a workout for the mind. And it is
something that as you exit that 90 minutes, you really feel like
you've accomplished a lot because often you have, and it just feels
deeply satisfying. And I'm convinced that that's because of the
release of neuromodulators like dopamine and the norepinephrine that's
circulating in your system. And I want to be clear that I'm not
perfect about this 90 minutes. Occasionally I get drawn away.
Occasionally something will happen or I'll go use the restroom or
Costello will have a need or somebody will have a need that I will
have to respond to, but I really try and achieve this most, if not
every day that I'm alive because for me, that work session is kind of
holy. It's where I set up a relationship, not just between me and the
work that I'm doing, but between me and my ability to control my own
state of mind using these various supports of the white noise, et
cetera. But really those supports are peripheral to the fact that I'm
creating this space. I'm funneling my brain into a state rather than
allowing whatever events and contexts on social media and elsewhere
might be occurring in the world that would yank me out of what for me
is my purpose and my mission in life, which is to do the sorts of work
that I do. There's a powerful way in which you can place the timing of
this 90-minute work about in an optimal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=2910"&gt;Optimal Time of Day To Do Hard Mental Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have access to a very important piece of data that dictates when
this about should start more or less and when it should end. That
piece of data is your temperature minimum. If you're somebody who
wakes up on average at 7:00 AM, well, then your temperature minimum is
5:00 AM. And you can be reasonably sure, I want to underscore
reasonably, but you can be reasonably sure that your best work is
going to be done anywhere from four to six hours after your
temperature minimum. So for me, I tend to wake up around 6:30 AM, that
means my temperature minimum is at 4:30 AM. You can add five hours to
that. So that means that a 90 minute work about could fall at 9:30 AM
and it would be fairly optimized. Or I could do it at 10:30 AM, or I
could do it at 8:30 AM. Somewhere in there, all right? That we can't
say that it's exactly six hours after your temperature minimum. You
will find it, however. There is a precise and best time for you to do
this 90-minute work about. Whether or not it's five or six hours after
your temperature minimum is going to vary from person to person. How
do I know this? How do I know this relationship between temperature
minimum and focus cognition? Well, temperature minimum defines the
trough, the nadir, as they say, of your temperature across the 24-hour
cycle. And immediately after that, your temperature will start to
rise. That temperature rise is actually what triggers the initial
cortisol release that you experience and wakes you up further. And
then, of course, that sunlight that you're getting is going to further
enhance that healthy release of cortisol. That cortisol will then
provide fuel, if you will, for that increase in temperature. And your
body will continue to increase in temperature throughout the day
toward the afternoon. What you're trying to do in this idea of
optimizing this 90-minute work about to a particular time of day is
catch the portion of the steepest slope of that temperature rise. Now,
again, you're not walking around with a thermocouple or a thermometer
in some orifice of your body. So you don't have accurate information
about temperature, but you can make very good guesses about when your
body temperature is rising fastest by virtue of that temperature
minimum. So again, just to be clear, it's a 90-minute work about.
That's about what the brain can handle for a very intense work about.
Do you understand, again, that they're going to be portions of that 90
minute that your brain is flickering in and out of focus, other
portions, where you're going to be entirely focused. That's entirely
normal. But when to place that 90-minute work about, when to start it,
and when to end it will depend on that temperature minimum. So if
you're somebody who wakes up at 8:00 AM each morning, your temperature
minimum is 6:00 AM, chances are you're going to want to start this
work about somewhere around 10:00 AM or 11:00 AM. Now, some people
wake up and feel very alert first thing in the morning. They can
really do their best work first thing in the morning. Please, if
that's you continue to do that. Leverage that time. Use that time. But
if you're somebody who struggles to find focus, definitely let your
physiology and this rise in your body temperature support your efforts
to focus rather than trying to do your best work at times of day when
your physiology is actually directing your body and your brain toward
de-focus and towards being more lethargic. It just is setting yourself
up for success when you try and capture this rising phase of your
temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=3127"&gt;Protocol 8: Optimal Exercise; 3:2 Ratio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So up until now, we've been emphasizing practices that allow you to
optimize your level of alertness and your levels of mental focus. Data
going back to the 1990s supports the idea that physical movement of
particular kinds can support brain health and brain function both in
the immediate term and in the long term. Now, this is has had a
profound impact on the field of neuroscience, but frankly, it's also
had a profound impact on how I structure my day. So after I've
finished a about of work, this 90-minute about of work, I force myself
some days, other days I want to, but I force myself to do some sort of
physical exercise that is going to be supportive of my brain health
and brain function and organ health and bodily function in general. So
I just briefly want to touch on what the structure of that exercise
looks like, how it's structured within the day and how it's structured
across the weeks in fact, based on the scientific data and what the
scientific data say is best or optimal in order to promote longevity
of the brain, ability to focus, as well as cardiovascular health and
all the other things that we know exercise supports. Now, there are
various forms of physical activity or what we call exercise, but those
can generally be batched into two categories. First is strength and
hypertrophy work. So physical movements that are designed to make you
stronger and/or make your muscles larger. There's also endurance work.
Physical exercise and movements that are designed to allow you to do
more work over time or to extend the amount of time that you can do
work of any kind, both physical and mental. And we did two full
podcast episodes on the details and the science and the protocols
related to these topics. We did an episode on the science of strength
and hypertrophy, of building strength and muscle building. And that
included a lot of protocols. And we did an episode on endurance. How
to build any one or all of the four types of endurance, which are
muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, long-distance endurance, et
cetera. So if you're interested in the specifics of those protocols,
please see those episodes. However, right now I just want to emphasize
how the data impact my day and how I structure my day in a way that I
can incorporate physical movement in a way that supports my brain and
health. Basically, after I finished that cognitive work about, that
90-minute work about, I do some form of physical exercise for about an
hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer
than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it
raises cortisol. And cortisol can be a good thing if it's
appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't
want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big
spikes of cortisol repeatedly. So keeping workouts relatively short
can definitely help with that And certainly if you're training hard,
60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient. And for many
people, including myself, 45 minutes or 50 minutes is probably even
more optimal. The basic design of this physical exercise is that it be
approximately 60 minutes. So maybe 60 plus or minus 15 minutes should
be well within the margins of keeping hormonal health proper and not
going too long nor making the workout so short that it's not
beneficial. And essentially what the data tell us is that in order to
optimize cardiovascular and brain health and other systems of the
body, we want to exercise at least five days per week. I know that
seems like a lot. It certainly is a lot for certain people. Some of
you, you compulsive exercisers, might gasp at the idea of taking two
days off. I personally find that taking two full days off per week is
actually both beneficial to my exercise training performance, as well
as pleasant. I like those rest days. But essentially the structure of
the exercise regimen that works for sake of supporting health is going
to be one in which there's a 3:2 ratio. Where for a 12-week period or
so, maybe 10 to 12 weeks, three of those five workouts per week
emphasize strength and hypertrophy and the other two emphasize
endurance. Then, after 10 or 12 weeks, one over to a 10- or 12-week
regimen of doing a 3:2 ratio where you're prioritizing endurance work.
So primarily the sorts of workouts that are described in the endurance
episode and those protocols. And the other two days, you're focusing
on strength and hypertrophy work merely to maintain strength and
hypertrophy, to not lose the strength and hypertrophy that you've
created. And there a lot of data now supporting the fact that
maintaining muscular health and bone health is supported by resistance
training, weight training of various kinds. It can also be done with
body weight if you don't have access to equipment. And, of course,
that doing cardiovascular endurance work is very beneficial both to
the muscles of the body, the organs of the body, but also to the
brain. Many of you have probably heard that doing physical exercise of
various kinds can support the production of new neurons in the brain.
Frankly, those data are specific to research animals. As far as we
know, increases in neuron number are not supported by exercise in
humans. There is a little bit of data that supports that maybe a few
neurons might get created by running or weightlifting or things of
that sort in human beings, but there's still a host of other reasons
to have this hour or so per day where one is doing physical exercise.
And those include increased blood flow to the brain. Remember, the
brain is an organ too. It's the most metabolically demanding organ in
your body and it's receiving those metabolic factors, it's receiving
its fuels by way of vasculature, of blood vessels and capillaries and
veins and things of that sort. So movement is very crucial to get your
brain to function properly. Movement of various kinds is very
important to get your brain to function properly. Resistance training
turns out to be as important as endurance training because of the way
that it stimulates the release of particular hormones actually from
bones, things like osteocalcin, which can positively impact brain
function and can support the health of existing neurons as opposed to
increasing the number of neurons. It turns out increasing the number
of neurons may not actually be as beneficial as we think. It all
sounds great. More neurons, more neurons. Certainly more neurons is
better than fewer neurons and losing neurons, but incorporating new
neurons into existing brain circuitry is actually very challenging for
the brain to do. I make sure that after that workout, I get this one
hour or so of exercise five days per week because of the ways that it
supports my general health. And there are now hundreds of studies
supporting the fact that both endurance work and strength training or
hypertrophy training done in combination, meaning not necessarily in
the same workout, but done across the week is immensely beneficial for
the production of things like brain-derived neurotrophic factor, for
limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, for promoting anti-
inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, provided that exercise is of the
proper duration and that it's not so intense that you're actually
creating damage to the various systems of the body. Now, where is the
threshold between optimal, sub-threshold and detrimental? This is a
complicated theme if we don't put some structure around it. So let's
put a little bit of structure around it. We already said that about 60
minutes, so 60 minutes plus or minus 15 minutes, is going to be
optimal for all these health benefits. What about the structure of the
actual workouts? Well, we need to address this issue of intensity. A
good rule of thumb based on the literature, and I discussed this with
Dr. Andy Galpin prior to this strength and hypertrophy and endurance
episodes, and the literature that's published in quality, peer-
reviewed journals really points to the fact that approximately 80% of
the resistance training you do should be resistance training that
doesn't go to what they call failure, where you can't actually move
the resistance anymore. The other 20% can be of the higher intensity
to failure type training. Now, with respect to endurance work, one can
build up endurance without having to log long, long mileage or
extensive mileage in the pool or by running. And that's because there
are these other forms of endurance that can build up, for instance,
the capillary beds within the muscles. Building up the capillary beds
within the muscles will allow more oxygen utilization within the
muscles, and thereby will increase your endurance both of the muscles,
but also will improve brain metabolism and the way that the heart
functions, so cardiovascular function. That 80/20 rule of less than
failure and work to failure in the resistance exercise regime can be
transported or translated to the endurance exercise portion by
focusing on that thing that we're familiar with, which is the burn
when we're running hard or cycling hard, we'll experience a kind of
burning of the muscles that's associated with the lactate system.
During the episode on endurance, I pointed out that that burn is not
lactic acid. Contrary to common belief, it is not lactic acid. It's
associated with lactate metabolism. And again, about 80% of the
endurance work should not incorporate that so-called "burn," but if
20% of that work or so, I should say approximately 20% of that work,
does include the so-called "burning sensation," that burning sensation
actually triggers the activation of release of certain compounds and
molecules from glia, this brain cell type that supports neuron health.
And actually, the lactate system is its own form of fuel for the
brain. And so there's increasing interest in generating the lactate or
pushing past that lactate threshold for small portion, 20% or so, of
endurance work in order to support brain health and function. So what
does all this all look like as a protocol? Well, as I mentioned
before, this 3:2 ratio. So maybe you spend 10 weeks or so or 12 weeks
or so focusing mainly on endurance, where three workouts per week on
endurance work, 80% of those workouts, meaning 80% of the time you're
below that burn threshold, you are not experiencing a burning
sensation, but that for 20% of it, you are. That, based on the
scientific data, should support lactate metabolism, brain health, et
cetera, as well as cardiovascular health and oxygen utilization. All
the forms of endurance that we're aware of. And then the other two
workouts would involve resistance training, again, with this 80/20
split, where 80% of the work is not to failure and 20% is. And then
maybe after 10, 12 weeks, you switch, where you start emphasizing
strength and hypertrophy work for three of the workouts and endurance
work for two of the workouts. Now, of course, some of you will be able
to train six days a week or you'll compulsively need to train seven
days a week. If you decide to do that, please be aware that this
cortisol threshold is a real thing. So for me, the 3:2 ratio works out
perfectly 'cause I like two full days off a week. When I take those
really depends on my schedule and how I'm feeling. Sometimes it's two
days in a row. Sometimes they're interspersed throughout the week. But
in reviewing the scientific literature for those two episodes of the
podcast and in talking to people who are really informed in the world
of resistance training and endurance training and how that relates to
brain health and body health, this seems to be the most rational and
grounded protocol, so that's the one that I follow. So on any given
day, I finish that work block and I train. I do some sort of
resistance or endurance training. I put those on alternate days or
different days, rather. So we've now talked about the arc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=3834"&gt;Tools for Training &amp;amp; Mental Focus: Fasting, Salt, Stimulants, Alpha-GPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that spans all the way from waking to a morning about of focused work
to physical training. I have not mentioned ingesting anything or
nutrients. One of the most common questions I get are what should I
eat for my brain? Well, ironically enough, one of the best things you
can do for your brain is to not eat, but, of course, we all have to
eat sooner or later and eating is wonderful. I absolutely love eating.
I even enjoy the mere act of chewing. But the question of what to eat
is an important one as it relates to brain health and brain function.
Before we talk about that, I want to emphasize that training fasted
actually has some immediate and long-term benefits. Prior to having my
lab at Stanford, I was down in San Diego at UC San Diego and had an
appointment at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies. I had a
colleague there by the name of Satchin Panda. He wrote a wonderful
book called "The Circadian Code." He runs a serious biology laboratory
focusing on metabolism, circadian rhythms, and so forth, as well as
the effects of fasting. Satchin and his book "The Circadian Code"
describe how engaging in physical exercise while fasted can amplify
the effects of that exercise, not just for sake of increasing the
percentage of things like body fat burned, et cetera, but for cellular
health, liver health, and the health of other organs. So where
possible, I do strive to do my workout without eating anything first.
However, some days I'm very, very hungry, and so I do ingest water,
which contains electrolytes, so that means sodium, magnesium,
potassium, for the simple reason that sodium, magnesium, potassium are
required for neurons to function properly. It's part of the way they
generate electrical activity. As well, Ingesting electrolytes for me
can quell hunger. And this points to a whole other topic we could do
another episode on at some point, which is many times people will
think that their blood sugar is low and actually that's not the case.
And frankly, one wouldn't want their blood sugar to be high. You don't
want your blood sugar too low, but you also don't want it too high.
Very low blood sugar is terrible, but lowish blood sugar tends to give
us a sense of mental clarity and focus, related to this adrenaline
phenomenon that we talked about earlier. In order to be able to focus
on exercise or work or anything else, you need sufficient
electrolytes. And so many people find that if they simply ingest some
water with salt, maybe a 99-milligram potassium tablet, all of a
sudden they feel very mentally clear and able to do physical work and
mental work. So what I do is, prior to this morning exercise, although
it's now late morning in this way I'm describing it and typically it
does occur late morning, I'll have some water with either maybe half a
teaspoon of sea salt with a 99-milligram potassium tablet or these
days I'm fond of taking what's called "LMNT." L-M-N-T. LMNT. I learned
about this from Lex Friedman's podcasts. I know many of you are
familiar with Lex, has a excellent podcast, excellent scientist. I
don't have any business relationship to LMNT. They're not a sponsor of
the podcast, but LMNT is a product that essentially contains
electrolytes: sodium, potassium, as well as magnesium malate, which
has been shown to offset things like delayed onset muscle soreness.
That form of magnesium doesn't make people drowsy. It's not an
anxiolytic like some other forms of magnesium. An anxiolytic is just
one that reduces anxiety. So whether or not it's LMNT or whether or
not you're just putting a little bit of salt into some water and
ingesting that prior to training, that can be an excellent way to
ensure that you're able to complete the physical exercise, even though
you haven't eaten anything. And I confess, some days I will eat a
little bit before my workout, just because I can't seem to resist
eating. I want to mention the use of stimulants before physical
training. This has certain benefits and certain drawbacks. The
benefits are sometimes it can facilitate motivation because things
like caffeine can increase the release of dopamine, can increase the
release of epinephrin, can reduce that adenosine level in the
bloodstream. So some people use caffeine before training in ways that
benefit them. It can also increase fat oxidation and kind of fat
metabolism and things if that's your goal. I'm not a particular fan of
ingesting stimulants before training because of a whole set of
problems associated with most forms of stimulants in the form of
energy drinks, et cetera. I am not a fan of energy drinks. I did a
decent portion of a previous episode on food and mood on energy drinks
and some of the detrimental things they contain. Rather, I try and
train simply by ingesting the caffeine sources I mentioned before,
guayusa, mate, some electrolytes, some water. Occasionally I'll have
an espresso or a cup of coffee before I train. And on rare occasions,
I should emphasize rare occasions, if I really need help increasing my
motivation or I decide I want to push extremely hard, I will ingest
something like alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC supports the release of a
neuromodulator called acetylcholine. So 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC
has been shown to increase physical performance, but also cognitive
performance. Some people might not be interested in ingesting anything
to improve their physical performance or anything at all, but they
might be addressing how they can improve cognitive performance and
focus. And alpha-GPC is a non-stimulant way to approach that. Again,
definitely check with your doctor before taking anything or stopping
to take anything, but alpha-GPC has been shown in various studies to
improve cognitive performance. And in people who have age-related
cognitive decline, there have been some positive benefits reported in
quality, peer-reviewed journals. If you want to explore those
references, please go to examine.com, go please put in alpha-GPC, go
to the Human Effect Matrix, and there you can find details of those
studies, references to PubMed, et cetera. So let's talk about food
timing first. As I mentioned, I eat my first meal sometime around noon
plus or minus an hour for the reasons we've discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=4200"&gt;Protocol 9: Eat For Brain Function &amp;amp; Mood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of food is also important. If you eat a large volume of
anything, because it diverts blood to your gut, you will feel
lethargic and you will have less blood going to your brain. That seems
like a simple and trivial fact, but if you want be able to think, you
can't ingest large volumes of anything into your gut. So the
discussion about what foods give you energy is kind of moot if you eat
enormous volumes of that food. Now, the volumes are going to depend on
you and your needs and your activity levels. I'm going to discuss what
I do in terms of food content, but I'm not going to discuss food
volume. I sort of know where that mostly full, like 80% full line is,
and I usually eat a little bit past that, frankly. And I'm able to
maintain a decent degree of alertness into the afternoon. And that's
my goal and I think that's the goal of most people, to not work out in
the morning or do some work, and then just collapse into a slumber
that lasts all afternoon, but to be able to generate alert, calm,
focus states throughout the day. So for lunch, I do emphasize slightly
lower carbohydrate or low carbohydrate intake for the simple reason
that adrenaline and dopamine and their associated neuromodulators are
going to support alertness. So for me, I fast up until about noon.
Then I eat a lunch that consists of some sort of protein thing, like
some meat or some chicken or some salmon and some vegetables, et
cetera. And if I've exercised previously, which I do, as I mentioned,
five days a week, then I will ingest some starches. I'll in just some
red or, bread, excuse me, or rice or oatmeal and butter and nuts and
things like that. I will consume the various food groups, as they say,
but I will keep the total amount of carbohydrate a little bit on the
low side, or if I haven't trained, I won't have any carbohydrate at
all. Not because I'm ketogenic, not because I'm inter carbohydrate,
not because I'm on a pure carnivore diet, far from it, but because
starches cause the release of serotonin in the brain and lend
themselves to a state of sleepiness. Now, I should mention that about
25% of individuals have genes that encode for enzymes that allow them
to eat large amounts of carbohydrate and not suffer from this
lethargy, this kind of sedation from carbohydrates. But I don't have
that gene, and so for me, eating a noonish meal that is not enormous,
but is decent in size, but that is mainly protein, healthy fats, and
lowish carbohydrates or no carbohydrates is what allows me to achieve
heightened states of alertness throughout the day, which is what I
need for my purposes. So just knowing that meats and nuts support
alertness, provided you don't eat too much of them, that vegetables
are healthy for us and therefore we should eat them, and I happen to
like them as well, and that carbohydrates tend to have a kind of
sedative like quality to them, that should help you and guide your
food choices in an intelligent way that's grounded in the scientific
literature as it relates to alertness. Now, what about components of
foods that are not about alertness, but are about mood? We did an
entire episode on mood and food, and it's very clear, based on now
dozens of studies, that ingesting sufficient levels of omega-3 fatty
acids is going to support healthy mood and even can act as an
antidepressant. More than a dozen studies have shown that ingesting at
least 1,000 milligrams per day of the EPA form of essential fatty acid
is as effective as prescription antidepressants in relieving
depression. And if you're somebody who requires prescription
antidepressants, Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera, it can allow people to
take lower doses of those medications, which in many cases is a
positive thing or a good thing to do because of the side effect
profiles that many of those drugs carry. So I find these data
remarkably compelling. I mean, here we have a food or a substance from
food that can improve our mood and our sense of wellbeing, and it does
that by way of increasing certain neuromodulators in the brain, in
particular dopamine, but also some other related neuromodulators. So
if you're eating fatty salmon regularly, if you're eating krill
regularly, meaning if you're a whale, if you're ingesting foods that
tend to have a lot of omega-3s, you probably don't need to supplement
with omega-3. Most people are not ingesting sufficient levels of
omega-3, and I'm certainly one of those people. Despite an effort to
eat good foods and whole foods, et cetera, and unprocessed foods, I've
made the choice to ingest at least 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA. I
do that in the form of fish oil and the EPA-DHA combination fish oil,
but the threshold of 1,000 milligrams is not 1,000 milligrams of fish
oil; it's 1,000 milligrams of EPA. Now, for those of you that don't
want to consume fish oils and prefer to get your omega-3s from non-
animal sources, there are non-animal sources, various forms of algae,
et cetera. You can just look that up online and you should be able to
find that. There are also a number of foods that include these
essential omega-3s. We did an episode on food and mood where I go into
more detail than you could ever want on that, as well as some
additional recommendations. We also did an episode on thyroid
function, this hormone that's important for metabolism, and that
pointed to the importance of getting sufficient iodine, which you
should naturally get from the salts you're ingesting, provided you're
ingesting enough salt. I'm not somebody who eats a lot of kelp, but,
or seaweed, although I don't mind the taste of seaweed, I don't ingest
it regularly, but ingesting sufficient selenium or selenium has been
shown to be important for proper thyroid production and thyroid
function, which is why I tend to eat a few Brazil nuts each day
typically with my lunch or sometimes before my workout. It doesn't
really matter. The point is that the volume, the amount, the content,
and indeed the ratios of protein to fat to carbohydrates are going to
impact how you feel and they're going to impact your brain health.
And, of course, the timing. We know that allowing periods of 12 hours
or more each 24-hour cycle where you're not ingesting anything is
beneficial for your brain and body health. That's what Satchin Panda
and his colleagues' work has shown over and over again in these
quality studies. So when people ask me, you know, "What should I eat
for my brain?" More often than not, it's really a question of how
you're structuring your day, when you're eating for the first time,
how long you're allowing yourself to fast each 24-hour cycle, and also
whether or not you're getting sufficient omega-3s, whether or not
you're getting sufficient selenium to support things like thyroid
function, which has an impact both on the metabolism of the body, but
also the metabolism in the brain. And when I say metabolism, I don't
just mean burning energy; I actually mean the rebuilding of things. So
in the episode on growth hormone and thyroid hormone, we talked about
how metabolism means, not just the breakdown of fats and
carbohydrates, but also the building up, the repair of muscle tissue,
the repair of bone, the reinforcing of bone and the repair and the
buildup of brain tissue. And so those are the things that I emphasize
because they are so strongly supported by the scientific data done in
mice studies, done in humans. And basically there's a lot of
biochemical evidence that supports everything that I just described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=4659"&gt;Protocol 10: Get Your Testosterone &amp;amp; Estrogen In An Ideal Range&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the lines of health and wellbeing, I'd be remiss if I didn't
mention hormones. Hormones have broad effects on the body and brain.
We did an entire month on hormones if you want to hear about any of
those hormones in detail. We talked about testosterone and optimizing
testosterone, estrogen, et cetera. The sex steroid hormones, which
include testosterone and estrogen, which, of course, are present in
varying ratios, but in both men and women and in kids, they are
manufactured from cholesterol. We hear about cholesterol as this
terrible thing, but they are actually made from cholesterol. And so if
you don't get sufficient levels of cholesterol, that can be
problematic for your hormones and that can be problematic for your
brain and your body health. So without going into too much detail,
I'll just point to a couple of things that I do that, at least from my
blood work and from my subjective experience, have been very
beneficial for me that some of you might want to consider. First of
all, I am not shy about my love for butter. I will eat packs of butter
directly. I believe if people are going to eat cheese without a
cracker, I will eat butter without a cracker. Butter is high in
cholesterol, so I don't eat a ton of it, but at least for me and for
my lipid profiles, it's fine. Butter has cholesterol, which is a
precursor to the sex steroid hormones, and men and women need
testosterone and estrogen in order to feel good and to be able to
think. You do not want your estrogen too low or your testosterone too
low. So I eat butter in order to ensure that I get sufficient
cholesterol. Butter also has some other things that are beneficial,
various small fatty acids that are that are interesting in terms of
their effects on metabolism, et cetera. You can look those up,
benefits of butter. But again, volume is important and you can't
overdo it. Costello incidentally loves butter as well. Along the lines
of hormones and testosterone, I get a lot of questions about this I
think because a lot of online communities are sort of obsessed with
testosterone, and I just want to emphasize that, yes, having
sufficient levels of testosterone is vitally important for brain
function and having sufficient levels of estrogen will allow your
brain to actually function. It turns out that estrogen is one of the
main ways in which the brain maintains longevity and maintains its
ability to think. So we should all be seeking optimal testosterone
levels for ourselves, both testosterone and estrogen. And many of the
things that we've discussed up until now, morning sunlight, exercise,
fasting, those can support testosterone and estrogen in meaningful and
positive ways. I get a lot of questions about hormone optimization. We
did an entire month on this topic. We did an entire episode on
testosterone and estrogen optimization. I just want to briefly
highlight two things that could be relevant, and then if you want more
details, please go see that episode. The first is that testosterone
can exert its various functions only in its unbound form, free
testosterone. We all make a particular binding protein called "sex
hormone binding globulin" that essentially binds up testosterone,
prevents it from being free. This sounds like a terrible thing, but
actually it's a good thing because it allows testosterone be
transported to the various tissues, including the brain, where it can
exert its various functions. For those that have lower than desired
levels of testosterone or too much sex hormone binding globulin, it
turns out that 400 milligrams per day of something called "tongkat
ali," which is a form of ginseng, can actually help increase levels of
free testosterone. Many people experience a positive subjective effect
and some objective affects as well, meaning increases in free
testosterone when they do blood analysis. There are some data on that,
not a ton in the peer-reviewed literatures, and again, always approach
these with a sense of caution and definitely talked to your doctor. If
you want to learn more about that, you can go to examine.com. There's
a lot of information there listed about that. The other compound
that's relevant both to men and women, or I should say people that are
trying to optimize testosterone and/or estrogen, is Fadogia. Fadogia
agrestis is actually an herb that increases the levels of what's
called "luteinizing hormone." Luteinizing hormone is a hormone that's
released from the hypothalamus within the brain that travels to the
gonads, either the ovaries or the testes, to stimulate the release of
estrogen or testosterone. And Fadogia agrestis has been shown, albeit
in a limited number of studies, to increase levels of luteinizing
hormone and thereby levels of testosterone and estrogen in ways that
some people find beneficial. So I just want to mention those two. And
again, if you want a lot more information about hormone optimization,
please see the episodes on hormone optimization. A key aspect to the
mid-day meal, if you want that meal to benefit you, is to take a brief
walk afterwards. It turns out that brief walks of five to 30 minutes
after ingesting food can accelerate metabolism and actually can
accelerate and improve nutrient utilization, which is essentially the
same as metabolism. But nonetheless, that's something that I do after
I finish my noon meal. I do force myself to stand up and go outside
and take a brief walk. That also gets me, again, into optic flow. It
also has another benefit, which is that I am giving my brain and
thereby my body more information about light and time of day, which is
always better than less information about light and time of day. Much
of our circadian rhythm and our health rhythms and all of our
cognitive rhythms, et cetera, are supported by our cells knowing where
they are in time, and light is the primary zeitgeber, that's German
for "timekeeper," is the primary way in which the body learns
information or about what function should be turned on and what
functions should be turned off. So getting that morning light pulse,
but then also leaving the house or apartment or workplace and getting
out for a few minutes after lunch is beneficial for metabolism,
beneficial for nutrient utilization, and beneficial for all the organs
and tissues of the body because you're getting that outside light
exposure. Now I'd like to shift our attention towards science
supported-protocols that increase the effectiveness and our
performance in everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=5040"&gt;Protocol 11: Reset the Mind &amp;amp; Body, Enhance Neuroplasticity, Reveri.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by everything I mean sleep, I mean physical performance, I mean
mental performance, I mean less anxiety, all the things. Truly all the
things. And that is something called "non-sleep deep rest." Non-sleep
deep rest or NSDR is an acronym that I coined as an umbrella term to
encompass many protocols that all have been shown, in one form or
another, to support better brain and body function. Now, these
protocols have names that you've heard before. Things like meditation,
things like yoga nidra, and things like hypnosis. All of these
protocols and these activities, however, share something in common,
which is they involve a deliberate and directed shift in one's state,
and the shift tends to be toward a state of deeper relaxation. We
certainly don't have time now to dissect out the literature on all of
these. There is ample literature, I should say there is robust and
ample literature, supporting the fact that a regular meditation
practice is beneficial. But meditation itself has many forms:
transcendental meditation, loving kindness meditation, third eye
meditation, walking meditation. Yoga nidra is a practice I've talked
about many times before, which involves simply lying down. It doesn't
involve any movement. No down dogs or up dogs or anything. It just
involves lying on your back and doing some specific long exhale
breathing. There are a lot of yoga nidra scripts out there that are
quite good. But there's one NSDR type protocol that has been shown by
the greatest number of scientific studies to promote not just states
of deep relaxation, not just states of heightened focus, but also to
accelerate plasticity and learning within the brain, and that's
hypnosis. And I've become increasingly excited and interested in
hypnosis as a tool, and not just a tool of any kind, but a tool that
really can be directed toward particular goals and outcomes. And I
think that's really what sets hypnosis apart as an NSDR, non-sleep
deep rest, protocol from things like naps or things like yoga nidra or
things like meditation. And I certainly believe and understand that
meditation naps and yoga nidra can be directed toward less anxiety, et
cetera, but hypnosis is unique in that it's very directed. The essence
of hypnosis is for the person, you, to guide your brain toward a
particular outcome or change. So I'd like to point out a particular
resource. It's a completely zero-cost resource, which is reveri.com.
That's R-E-V-E-R-I.com. reveri.com obviously is a website where there
are links to an app that's available in Apple and Android. This is a
hypnosis app, but this isn't just any hypnosis app. This is a hypnosis
app that contains multiple hypnosis protocols that are all backed by
very high-quality science. The science was done by my colleague and
our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford School of Medicine, that
David Spiegel is responsible for that work. I'm not associated with
that scientific work. They've examined what brain areas get activated
during hypnosis, what the outcomes are for various hypnosis protocols.
And within Reveri, you will find hypnosis protocols for enhancing your
focus, enhancing creativity, reducing pain, getting better at
sleeping, reducing anxiety. Most of these are about 10 or 15 minutes
long. Some of them are extremely brief. One minute long. They have a
one-minute hypnosis that you can do. Those one minute hypnosis scripts
work best if you've been doing the 10 and 15 minute ones regularly or
semi-regularly. It's a really wonderful resource for which there is a
lot of peer-reviewed published data. One study I'd like to emphasize
in particular is Jiang et al. J-I-A-N-G. That is a reference you can
find on the reveri.com website under Our Research. And the title of
this paper is "Brain Activity and Functional Connectivity Associated
with Hypnosis," and it was published in the journal Cerebral Cortex.
What this paper essentially shows is that specific areas of our brain
that are involved in executive function, which is associated with our
ability to focus, as well as what's called the "default mode network,"
which is sort of the way that your brain idles, does your brain tend
to idle at a level of high anxiety or calm, as well as activation of a
brain area called the "insula." That's I-N-S-U-L-A. The insula is
extremely interesting. Hypnosis has been shown to activate the insula,
which can enhance our sense of interoception, our sense of internal
state, which might sound like a annoying thing. You don't want to be
thinking about your heartbeat or your breathing. But what's really
interesting about hypnosis is that it increases areas of the brain
that are responsible for deep relaxation, focus, and self-awareness,
this interoception, simultaneously. And that's very unusual compared
to other states, any other states of any kind. So I've made it a
practice, a daily practice in fact, that after lunch and after this
walk, I do a brief 10-minute hypnosis script because what I've found
is that in contrast to naps and in contrast to other forms of NSDR, it
really allows me to enter a state of deep relaxation, but also to then
exit that state in a very focused and deliberate way that allows me to
lean into my afternoon in an alert way, in a way that I can function
and do mental work and interact with people, et cetera. So there's no
brain fog, there's no grogginess. And I want to emphasize that the
hypnosis that I'm referring to here and that Reveri provides is not
stage hypnosis. This isn't you being programmed to squawk like a
chicken or do anything against your will. This is you teaching your
brain how to access these focused, relaxed, interoceptive states. This
is also an extremely valuable aspect to hypnosis because it can
increase plasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to
experience. It's essentially opening up pathways that allow you to
change your brain in the ways that you want. And it's very directed
toward particular outcomes So I am an, as you can probably tell, I'm
very enthusiastic about hypnosis as an optimal NSDR protocol, and so I
do that every single day. There are days that I don't manage to do it
for whatever reason. I forget or interference from email or et cetera.
But that is essentially how I enter my early afternoon. I do this
post-lunch, post-walk NSDR in the form of a Reveri hypnosis. Again, a
completely zero-cost resource to you. There are excellent data. All
those data can be found on the Reveri site, and you can also learn a
lot more about hypnosis and what sorts of hypnosis protocols might be
optimal for you. So if you are looking for a science-backed, zero-
cost, very effective tool for getting better at focusing, better at
sleeping, better at all the things that I believe people want, I do
believe that is the best tool that one can access at this point in
time. So then after I exit hypnosis, I usually give Costello a little
scratch behind the ear, and then I make sure that I hydrate.
Hydration, again, is vitally important for brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=5475"&gt;Protocol 12: Hydrate Correctly, Nap Rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's vitally important for all bodily functions. And I often forget to
do it, so I've just sort of linked the drinking of water to my
hypnosis practice. As soon as I'm done, I hydrate. And then I tend to
focus on another work about. So this would be, for me, sometime around
2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon when normally I would be quite sleepy
and passing out. However, the protocol of shifting my morning caffeine
to 90 minutes to two hours after waking, as well as the use of this
hypnosis protocol has really allowed me to move through the afternoon
in a way that I don't experience that dip in. Energy every once in a
while I'll feel kind of sleepy or kind of out of it, but I've been
really pleasantly surprised at the extent to which one can avoid that
afternoon dip. If you do certain things properly prior to the arrival
of 2:00 or 3:00 PM. Now, if you're a napper and you want to nap, no
big deal. Naps can be wonderfully beneficial. Here are the rules
around napping according to the sleep science. Stanford has an
excellent sleep clinic. I consulted with Jamie Zeitzer, my colleague
in the Stanford Sleep Laboratory, as well as Matt Walker out at
Berkeley whose name I'm sure most of you are familiar with. He wrote
this wonderful book, "Why We Sleep." Naps should be 90 minutes or
less, and 20-minute naps are fine, but not longer than 90 minutes. And
there are essentially two varieties of people: people for whom napping
interferes with falling asleep later that night and staying asleep and
people for whom the nap does not interfere. You have to decide who you
are. And if you're somebody who can nap and not have any trouble
falling asleep and staying asleep later that night, well, by all
means, nap. Just make it 90 minutes or less. Again, these 90-minute
cycles are really a vital constraint that we should all obey. If it's
91 minutes, don't worry. You won't dissolve into a puddle of tears.
But if you're starting to sleep for an hour or more in the afternoon,
that can be problematic. If you're somebody who can nap for 10, 20
minutes, that's probably better than getting a full 90-minute cycle,
unless you didn't get enough sleep the night before. But you really
have to figure out what's right for you. There's a lot of variety
there. But that's essentially what the science says. Now, whether or
not you nap or whether or not you do not nap, a key protocol for sleep
health and wakefulness and metabolism and hormone health is viewing
light in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=5609"&gt;Protocol 13: View Late Afternoon/Evening Light To Support Sleep &amp;amp; Dopamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the reason for doing this. As we progress into the evening
hours, there's a phenomenon where our retina, our eyes, become very
sensitive to light, such that if we view bright lights or even not so
bright lights between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM, that is
strongly disruptive, very disruptive for our dopamine production. It
can really screw up our sleep, and it's actually been shown in data
from David Berson's lab at Brown University, one of the foremost
circadian biology laboratories, as well as Samer Hattar's laboratory
at the National Institute of Mental Health that viewing bright light,
or even not so bright light, between these hours of 11:00 PM and 4:00
AM or even 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM can disrupt learning and memory, can
disrupt the immune system and can disrupt mood in very long-lasting
ways. There are ways to offset that, however. What I call your
"Netflix inoculation." For those of you that like to stay up late on
the tablet or computer or watching Netflix, getting a little bit of
afternoon light in your eyes, somewhat counter-intuitively, can
prevent this disruption of bright light later in the evening, at least
somewhat. What do I mean by that? Well, if you view light as the sun
is starting to go down, so if you step outside around 4:00 PM, 5:00
PM, again, what time exactly will depend on time of year and where you
are located on our planet, but as the sun starts to head down, you
don't necessarily have to see the sunset, it'd be lovely if you could,
sunsets are beautiful, but if you can get outside and see the sun as
it arcs down, or if you can't see the sun directly, get some sunlight
in your eyes in the afternoon hours, so maybe 4:00 PMish, and do that
for 20, 30 minutes, maybe reading outside or taking a walk, I walk the
dog again, that's my protocol, in order to get that evening light,
what it does is it lowers the sensitivity of your retina in the late
evening hours, which allows you to buffer yourself against the
negative effects of bright light later at night. Now, it won't allow
you to blast your eyes with bright light; you still need to dim the
lights in the evening. But there's a very nice study that was
published in scientific reports that illustrates that if one does
this, if you go outside and view sunlight in the evening hours for
anywhere from five to 30 minutes, and I realized that people have a
range of constraints on their schedule, but from five to 30 minutes,
what happens is that your melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, we
haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone
that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light. And
melatonin is the hormone that allows you to fall asleep easily. Now,
I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin; I'm talking about
melatonin that you naturally produce from your pineal. So the protocol
is very simple: get outside in the afternoon or evening for 10 to 30
minutes, take your sunglasses off, get some bright light, get some
natural light in your eyes. If you can't do that, probably better to
just stay with standard artificial lights inside. Don't crank them up,
but just start to dim them. Again, this would be a time to avoid blue
blockers. People are popping on blue blockers at four o'clock in the
afternoon 'cause you're worried that blue light is going to disrupt
your sleep. Well, you're making your eyes more sensitive to any light
that you might see later in the evening, blue light or otherwise. So
get that afternoon light. So what you'll probably notice is that the
optimal protocols for optimizing your brain and body health and
performance and sleep, et cetera, are actually really simple. But just
because they're simple does not mean that they are not powerful; in
fact, they are very powerful because they leverage the most powerful
technology that exists, which is your nervous system. You know, we
always think about technologies as devices, and indeed there are some
wonderful devices out there. Some people are really into tracking
their sleep and their sleep time. If you're into that, great. That's
not something that I personally do, although I keep telling myself
that I should do that. There are devices that can control brainwaves
and things of that sort. But what we are talking about today are
really basic things that we can all do that can steer our neurology
and our biology in the directions that are going to support workflow,
that are going to support hormones, that are going to support brain
function. So this afternoon light viewing is yet another example of
leveraging a technology that you were born with and that you will die
with and that you will have every day in between in order to tweak the
hormones of your system, in this case, the hormone melatonin, so that
it's released at the appropriate times and not at the wrong times.
Because we know that when hormones and systems of the body are well
aligned with the 24-hour schedule, beautiful things happen. And when
they are misaligned, terrible things happen. Sometimes those terrible
things are subtle at first, but disrupting your circadian rhythms is
really bad for every system in your body. Getting it right, and as you
can tell, getting it right doesn't take much, can really serve to
"optimize" you. When I say "optimize," I mean it puts you into a
better mood overall, better state for learning, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=5940"&gt;Protocol 14: Eat Dinner That Promotes Serotonin, Calm Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get that afternoon light as well. So at some point in the evening,
I eat that thing that we call dinner. And while it feels sort of
strange to talk about my dinner, the reason I want to talk about my
dinner and what I eat for dinner is that for me, dinner, of course, is
about eating I'll mention again I love eating but also about
optimizing the transition to sleep and sleep. So obviously I eat foods
that I enjoy. I'm not one of these people that will eat anything or
avoid eating anything simply to benefit from that. I do enjoy food
very, very much. And so my dinner generally is comprised of things
that are going to support rest and deep sleep. And that means starchy
carbohydrates. It's absolutely clear that one of the major ways that
we can increase serotonin, which helps in the transition to sleep, is
by ingesting starchy carbohydrates. Now, I realized that starchy
carbohydrates are kind of a demonized term nowadays and everyone's
anti-carbs, but, you know, we really should distinguish between
refined sugars and complex carbohydrates. And we did an episode about
this. We talked about how refined sugars disrupt, not just metabolism,
but they actually disrupt some of the neurons in the gut that sense
fatty acids and amino acids from fats and proteins. But those same
neurons can actually respond to sugar and create a situation where you
actually start craving more sugar because those neurons in your gut
communicate via a nerve pathway for you aficionados called "the vagus
nerve" and a little cluster of neurons called the "nodose ganglia."
N-O-D-O-S-E. Nodose ganglias are right next to the corner of your jaw
and can trigger the activation and the release of dopamine in your
brain, which basically makes you crave more sugar, independent of how
something tastes. So when I say carbohydrates, what I really mean is
starchy carbohydrates, non-refined sugars. And in the episode about
food and mood and metabolism as well, I referenced a really
spectacular lecture by Dr. Robert Lustig who's a pediatric
endocrinologist at UCSF, UC San Francisco, absolutely spectacular
talk, you can find it on YouTube easily, where he talks about the
science of refined sugars. And this isn't in any kind of conspiracy or
paranoid way. This is really the medical and scientific literature. So
my dinner is carbohydrates and some protein. So maybe some chicken or
fish or something like that, maybe some eggs, or sometimes just pasta
or just rice and vegetables. And that's because I enjoy those foods,
but also because I want to increase the amount of serotonin in my
brain so that I can actually fall asleep that night. Many people who
are on low-carbohydrate diets struggle with falling and staying
asleep, and that's because it's hard to achieve heightened levels of
serotonin which are necessary to enter sleep. I should also mention
that melatonin and serotonin fall in the same pathway. They are
related hormones and neuromodulators. We won't go into their
biosynthesis now, but essentially what we're talking about is a system
that's biasing us towards rest and relaxation as opposed to
wakefulness. You might ask, "Well, can't I just take serotonin? Can't
I just take 5-HTP or a precursor to serotonin or tryptophan?" And
indeed you can, however, many people including myself, find that when
they supplement with serotonin in the evening or at night, that can
cause problems in the architecture or the structure of sleep. It can
cause a lot of people, including me, to fall asleep very fast, sleep
very deeply for three or four hours, and then wake up and have a
terrible time falling back asleep. And that effect, at least for me,
can last several days. It's really disruptive. So I don't like to
supplement with anything that is directly dopamine or a precursor to
dopamine at any time or directly serotonin or a precursor to
serotonin. Rather, there are other things that can enhance the
transition to sleep safely, which we will talk about in a few minutes.
But the evening meal consists largely of carbohydrates for that
specific purpose of generating a sense of calm. And, of course,
carbohydrates are delicious. And because I'm doing some physical
training and presumably you are as well, or I hope you are, 'cause
it's so beneficial to one's health, that's also going to replenish my
glycogen stores, which is one of the primary fuel sources for moving
one's muscles and moving around and doing exercise, as well as for the
brain and for cognitive function. So low carbohydrates throughout the
24-hour period are not something that are attractive to me. I realized
that some people will do much better on a low-carbohydrate or even
ketogenic diet, but for me, and I do believe for most people, creating
a situation of maybe fasting, and then low-carb or no-carb diets for
states of alertness and focus at one portion of the day, and then
ingesting starchy carbohydrates for sake of inducing rest and
relaxation is a at least scientifically, rationally-based protocol.
It's grounded in real neurochemistry. It's grounded in things that we
can point to and say, "Ah, this food substance, this thing can support
my brain, not directly because it's some magic substance that's going
to make all my neurons, you know, extremely robust, but rather it's
going to support sleep," which is perhaps the foundation of all mental
and physical health. In fact, we can point to sleep as the primary way
in which we can ensure our overall health, including our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=6267"&gt;Protocol 15: Optimize Falling &amp;amp; Staying Asleep; Tools &amp;amp; Supplements That Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about sleep and how to access sleep, how to fall asleep
easily, and how to make sure that the sleep we have is of sufficient
duration and quality. One way to do that is to leverage the drop in
temperature that's necessary to fall and stay asleep. So I mentioned
earlier in the early parts of the day after waking, our body
temperature is rising, and that continues throughout the day. And then
sometime late in the afternoon, our temperature peaks, and then it
starts to drop. That drop in temperature of one to three degrees is
vitally important for us to be able to fall asleep easily. One way
that we can decrease our transition time into sleep is to accelerate
that drop in temperature. And one way to accelerate that drop in
temperature somewhat counter-intuitively is to use hot baths, hot
showers, or if you have access to one, a sauna. Now, this is
counterintuitive because you'd say, "Well, hot bath, so it's going to
heat me up." But actually, if you are to get into a sauna or a hot
shower or hot bath, and then get out, your body is going to engage
particular mechanisms for cooling itself off that are going to allow
you to drop your temperature more quickly and fall asleep more easily.
And this is why many people find that falling asleep after a nice hot
shower, bath, or sauna is really, really easy and really terrific.
It's sort of a natural state that follows hot baths, saunas, and
showers. So how would you do this? Well, we did an entire episode on
this topic as well. The use of sauna for sake of growth hormone
release. If you want to check that out in all the details, you can
look at the episode on growth hormone. You will experience a growth
hormone release from sauna, hot bath, and hot shower, provided they're
done for sufficient duration and sufficiently high temperature. For
all the details of that, please go to that episode. It's all laid out
there, it's all timestamped, it's all captioned in English and
Spanish, et cetera. But basically what we're talking about is 20
minutes in the sauna, or if you're one of those folks who's really
chasing growth hormone release, you could do 20 minutes, then get out
of the sauna for 10 minutes, and just cool off at room temperature,
and then get back into the sauna, then get out, and then shower, dry
off, and head to bed. Shorter bouts of sauna will work also. The
longer bouts of sauna, cooling, sauna, cooling have been shown to lead
to huge increases in growth hormone. And growth hormone, of course, is
involved both in muscle growth, but also growth and metabolism of all
tissues, fat metabolism, and repair of various tissues. So it's not
just about growth. You hear growth hormone, you think hypertrophy, but
the enhancement of metabolism and health and repair in a number of
tissues. So that's one way you can leverage heat toward the transition
to sleep by the ways in which exposure to heat actually cools off your
body. Now let's talk about actually getting to sleep. And let's talk
about behavioral protocols first. It is absolutely true that keeping
the room very dark is beneficial. Some people, including myself, have
thin eyelids and it doesn't take much light to wake up the brain and
body. So keeping a room very dark is essential. The other thing is
keeping the room cool. You've probably heard this before. Keep the
room cool, get under warm blankets, but rarely is it discussed why
keeping the room cool is useful. The reason keeping the room cool is
useful for getting into and staying asleep is that throughout the
night, there are phases of sleep where you are paralyzed, so-called
REM sleep, that's a healthy paralysis, presumably so you can't act out
your dreams, but there are portions of the night where you can move.
And one of the more important movements that you do in the middle of
the night is put your hand out or your foot out or you take your face
out from under the covers as a means to cool yourself, and you do this
while you are asleep. If you are in a cool room, you can put yourself
under the blankets to stay warm, and then if you want to cool off, you
can simply remove a limb or you can toss the covers off entirely.
However, if you are in a room that's too warm, it's very hard to cool
off. You would need a bucket of ice water or to get up and turn on the
air conditioning or something of that sort or turn on the fan. So it's
a simple but non-trivial way in which we can improve our entrance to
sleep and staying asleep. So keep the room cool or cold and get under
warm blankets. And if you want to understand more about why putting a
hand out or a foot out is valuable for cooling, I did an episode on
the role of cooling in something called "heat dumping" or bringing he
into the body through the palms, the face, and the bottoms of the
feet. You've got these portals, these radiators, if you will, that
allow us to bring heat into the body and to dump heat. I don't want to
go into the details now, but that episode is entitled "Supercharge
Your Exercise With Cold," is based on work that was done by Craig
Heller's lab at Stanford University. Absolutely incredible data
showing that the proper use of palmar cooling, so the palms or the
upper half of the face or the bottoms of the feet, can vastly, I mean
vastly increase the volume of exercise that one can do and still
recover from that exercise and derive benefits from it. But this
method of cooling for exercise is grounded in a basic physiological
function of our palms, the bottoms of our feet, and our face, which is
to dump heat or to allow cool to pass into the body. So that's why in
the middle of the night, as long as you're not in REM sleep, if you
get too warm, you put your foot out or you put your arms out. You're
actually allowing cooling of the body through what are called "AVAs,"
arteriovenous anastomosis is the technical name, that are in the
palms, the upper half of the face, and the bottoms of the feet. And
that's a very efficient way to cool off your body, so you do that
subconsciously. Now, there are things that one can take to enhance the
transition to sleep. I am not a fan of melatonin for enhancing the
transition to sleep for a couple of reasons. One, dosages of melatonin
are far too high in most supplements. Melatonin can have some negative
effects on the sex steroid hormones testosterone and estrogen. That's
a serious concern. Third, melatonin's role during puberty or around
puberty is to suppress the onset of puberty. So that's concerning. I
don't know that people should be taking this hormone that has all
these other effects. The other reason is that melatonin will aid the
transition to sleep, but it won't keep you asleep. And many people
that take melatonin find that they fall asleep more quickly, but then
they wake up unable to fall back asleep. Three compounds that can be
very beneficial for aiding the transition to sleep and for which there
are wide safety margins, although please do check with your physician
before taking anything, are specific forms of magnesium, something
called "apigenin" and "theanine." Magnesium comes in many forms.
Magnesium malate has been shown to improve recovery from sore muscles,
for instance. Magnesium citrate is an excellent laxative, for
instance, Magnesium threonate, that's T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate,
and magnesium bisglycinate have transporters that allow them to cross
the blood-brain barrier more readily than other forms of magnesium.
And there within the brain, they promote the release of a
neurotransmitter called GABA, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter
which shuts off the forebrain to some extent. It doesn't shut it off
completely, but it essentially shuts down thinking, rumination,
planning, and in what we call "executive function." So for many
people, taking 300 to 400 milligrams of magnesium bisglycinate or
magnesium threonate, and there I'm referring to the elemental
magnesium for you aficionados, many people find that doing that 30 to
60 minutes before sleep can aid them in falling asleep, can really
help them fall asleep faster and stay asleep. Some people, however,
achieve some gastrointestinal discomfort from magnesium and therefore
should avoid it. Magnesium threonate and magnesium bisglycinate for
many people work, however, and when coupled with apigenin and
theanine, provide a sort of synergy or a sleep cocktail that seems to
be very effective in aiding the transition to sleep. So apigenin is
the substance that's found in chamomile. And 50 milligrams of apigenin
taken 30 minutes before sleep can act as another way to shut off the
forebrain and reduce rumination, reduce anxiety, and allow people to
fall and stay asleep. I did a podcast with Dr. Darya Rose. She's got
an excellent podcast that I highly recommend you check out. Covers a
number of different health, scientific, and other subjects. And she's
a PhD in neuroscience, terrific scientist, et cetera. She's a big fan
of apigenin, as am I. And then the third compound is theanine, T-H-E-
A-N-I-N-E. Theanine is a compound that can also increase GABA, but
also increases activation of something called "chloride channels."
Chloride channels are another way in which neurons turn themselves off
or turn each other off. Not turn each other off in the way that we
typically hear like that turns me off, but turn them off and then shut
them down. Lower their levels of activity. So magnesium threonate or
bisglycinate, apigenin, and theanine in combination can be very
effective for aiding the transition to sleep. And I realized that not
everyone wants to take supplements. I certainly am not pushing any of
these. I would hope that everybody be able to fall asleep easily and
stay asleep for the duration of time that they want without any
supplemental help, but I do think it's important to point out some
things that lie somewhere between doing nothing and taking
prescription drugs, because many of the prescription drugs associated
with sleep, and you all know what those are, carry other side effects.
They can create bad dreams, often very disturbing dreams. They can be
addictive or at least habit forming. They can create grogginess in the
morning. Some are safer than others. There's a variety of them out
there. But for those that want to explore supplements and how they can
impact sleep, this combination of about 300, 400 milligrams of
magnesium threonate or bisglycinate, 50 milligrams of apigenin, and
100 to 200 milligrams of theanine alone or in combination have been
beneficial to many people. And there are excellent studies to support
those statements. Again, I suggest you go to examine.com and look up
the Human Effect Matrix for each of those compounds, and you can
explore them. One of the more interesting aspects to magnesium
threonate and bisglycinate is that it seems to have some
neuroprotective effects as well. There aren't many studies on it, but
the few studies that are there point to the fact that magnesium
threonate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=6900"&gt;Protocol 16: Preventing Middle of the Night Waking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and magnesium bisglycinate can also support neuron health and neuron
longevity, which is just an added bonus, in my opinion. Now, what if
you wake up in the middle of the night? This is a very common
occurrence. And there are two general themes around waking up in the
middle of the night that one can use tools to counteract. The first
theme is if you're somebody who is tired in the evenings and you're
kind of pushing yourself to stay awake, so you're going to the party
or you're pushing yourself to study or work when in fact you'd like to
get into bed at 8:30 or 9:00, and then you're falling asleep around
10:30, 11:00, and waking up at 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning and you
can't fall back asleep, chances are that your melatonin pulse was
initiated early in the night. So that melatonin pulse started probably
around 8:30 or 9:00, but you're staying up, you're battling that
melatonin. And then sometime around 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning, that
melatonin is no longer present at sufficiently high levels in your
bloodstream and you're waking up, you're getting your morning cortisol
pulse shifted into those wee hours of the morning. You may not like
this advice, but one of the things that you can do to offset that is
to simply go to bed earlier. By going to bed earlier, you're going to
get the longer duration of sleep. But I realized that there are social
reasons and work-related reasons why going to bed at 8:30 or 9:00 is
not necessarily beneficial to your life. So in that case, you might be
one of the rare individuals for whom getting a little bit more bright
light in the evening could be a good thing. So this would be around
the hours of 7:00 or 8:00 PM. And in that way, causing that pulse in
melatonin to be delayed because, again, light inhibits melatonin. Now,
the other thing is many people wake up in the middle of the night
because of anxiety or because they have to use the restroom. It's
perfectly fine to flip on the lights, but keep the lights dim. But if
you flip on those lights, try and flip them off as soon as possible
and try and get back into bed. And if you have trouble falling asleep
again and you absolutely need to sleep, that's where these NSDR, these
non-sleep deep rest protocols, can really be beneficial, even though
the NS, the non-sleep part, might make you think that they will
prevent you from falling asleep. Rather than trying to fight your
mind, trying to fight anxiety, which is always a terrible thing to do,
I always say it's very hard to control the mind with the mind, look to
the body. And that's what NSDR scripts do. Things like yoga nidra,
even the sleep hypnosis done in the middle of the night if you wake up
and want to fall back asleep oftentimes will help you fall back asleep
immediately. And if they don't, they will at least put your brain and
body into a state of deep relaxation that more closely mimics the
sleep state that you ought to be in than the awake, ruminating,
stressing about the fact that you're not sleeping state. So if you
wake up in the middle of the night, really try and get back to sleep.
And if you can't do that by doing, for instance, long exhale
breathing, which can work, use some other tool of the body to shift
the mind. And the tools that I'm recommending are of the non-sleep
deep rest variety. So now we've essentially traveled around the clock,
so to speak, from the time where one wakes up until the time they
start working, until the time they exercise, eat lunch, do an NSDR,
head to sleep, get to sleep, maybe wake up, get back to sleep, et
cetera. I want to emphasize that, although people's schedules vary,
most people are doing more than one or two work bouts per day. And
indeed, I'm doing more than one or two work bouts per day. I really
emphasize that morning, 90-minute work block because I think most
people would agree that there's a portion of each day in which we need
to do the hardest thing or the most important thing or the thing that
demands the most of our cognitive self. I position that early in the
day and I position everything around that in order to ensure that it
happens and that it happens with the highest degree of efficiency, and
yes, I make sure that it happens every day. And that brings about two
other important points. First of all, we do have this thing called
weekends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXvDEmo6uS4&amp;amp;t=7150"&gt;Protocol 17: Weekends, Recovering From A Poor Nights Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I tend to take one day off per week, not both, much to the dismay
of people in my life and Costello. But nonetheless, there is something
called weekend drift, which is that we can be very regimented on a
Monday or a Tuesday, and then even if we're good about maintaining a
schedule Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, et cetera, most of us, I would
hope, would alter their schedule somewhat on the weekends in order to
recover and get some additional rest. And I want to emphasize I
absolutely do that. I take one day per week where I go full Costello,
where I essentially do nothing in a structured way. At least if I have
my way, I'm not making any plans, I'm completely free to explore what
I want to do and when I want to do it. That's not the way life works
out. Oftentimes there are social engagements and other things that get
in the way or that I enjoy and that breaks up the day, but I do take
rest. I don't think that one has to follow the same schedule every
single day; however, I do think there are a few things that people
should do every single day, if possible, and those are get morning
sunlight, because if you don't your circadian rhythms and your health,
et cetera, and your mood are going to start to drift, and to try and
get sleep on a regular basis. And, of course, some of the greatest of
things in life happen after 10:00 PM and some of those even involve
sleepless nights of various kinds. I certainly don't want to
discourage people from having a social life or from having a robust
party life, if that's your thing, or for enjoying life because that's
certainly one of the main things that we should all be pursuing, is to
enjoy life. The only point I want to make about sleep is that if you
happen to stay up late, it's still best to get up at your regular
wake-up time. It's a very simple solution to a problem that a lot of
people have, which is they stay up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning,
and then they tend to sleep late, and then it tends to disrupt their
rhythm. Try on most days and most nights to wake up at more or less
the same time and try to go to sleep at more or less the same time. In
fact, I was talking to Matt Walker about this recently, and he was
also surprised to see these new data and I was surprised to see these
new data that emphasize that if you get a poor night's sleep or if
you're up late the previous night for good reasons, many people feel
like they just want to go to bed early the next night, but it turns
out that's not the best thing to do for your immediate and long-term
health. Try and stay up to the point where you would normally stay up,
and then get to sleep. If you go to bed a couple hours earlier, it's
probably not going to kill you, but try to not go to bed, for
instance, at 6:00 PM, because you were up the entire night before.
That can really be disruptive. The other thing I want to emphasize is
that even though that morning, 90-minute work block is so vital, of
course, there's a second work block. And in fact, I described one in
the afternoon after the NSDR. For me, that's Reveri hypnosis. There's
a 90-minute work block in which I drop in again in a no internet
connection, no phone kind of way to complete some work that's
important to me. So combined, that's just three hours of focused work,
which may not seem like a lot, but if you were to dissect your day and
kind of look at the arc and structure of your day, I'd be willing to
bet that if we added up the total period of time in which you were in
what Cal Newport would call deep work, really focused, dedicated work,
that it would probably amount to about three or four hours. If you can
squeeze in another 90-minute work block or if you can get four
90-minute work blocks, well, then more power to you, but I think most
people find that one or two of these really deep focus, 90-minute work
blocks are about what one's schedule and even mind can handle. And, of
course, throughout the day, there are other things happening. Outside
of those 90-minute work blocks, I'm checking my text messages, I'm
checking my email, I'm responding to various demands. I'm working and
tending to life. So while I've carved some boundaries or delineated
some boundaries around those work blocks, and I'm certain that if you
do too, you will benefit from them, they are certainly not the only
periods of time each day in which I or I believe other people should
be trying to learn or trying to focus. And I want to emphasize that
even though my job is to discover knowledge and distribute knowledge
because I'm a scientist, I realized that 90-minute work blocks of the
sort that I'm describing may not apply specifically to the kinds of
work you do. If you're an artist or a sculptor or you build furniture,
whatever it is that you happen to, you teach children or they teach
you, whatever it happens to be, of course, please adapt and modify
what I've described today in ways that best serve you and your
schedule. What I've tried to do is provide you a picture of the 24-
hour schedule that I follow and why I do certain things at particular
times and why I do those particular things. And I've really tried to
emphasize the scientific rationale behind those things, the peer-
reviewed data. In some cases, I pointed out the specific papers. In
other cases, I've referred to large bodies of work that support these
practices. When I say "large bodies of work," I'm a big fan of looking
to the scientific literature and asking, "Where is the center of mass
for a particular topic?" For instance, where is there 50 or 100 or
1,000 papers that, for instance, support morning light viewing in
order to optimize melatonin secretion in the day, cortisol secretion
early in the day, mood, metabolism, et cetera? If one were to put into
PubMed "light, metabolism, and mood," you would literally get tens of
thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of studies. So when I say
the center of mass, what I've really tried to do is examine the
literature and figure out where there's sort of a directive protocol
that emerges from all these various studies that used, you know, in
some cases, animals, in many cases, humans and explored different,
what we call, "dependent variables." Some studies were looking at
effects on blood sugar, other on mood. So I hope that makes clear why
the rationale behind what I provided today. If you're learning from

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Overview of Topics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. Today, we're going to talk all about hearing and balance and
how you can use your ability to hear specific things and your balance
system in order to learn anything faster. The auditory system, meaning
the hearing system, and your balance system, which is called the
vestibular system, interact with all the other systems of the brain
and body and, used properly, can allow you to learn information more
quickly, remember that information longer and with more ease and you
can also improve the way you can hear. You can improve your balance.
We're going to talk about tools for all of that. This is one area of
science, where we understand a lot about the cells and the mechanisms
in the ear and in the brain and so forth. So we're going to talk about
that a little bit, and then we're going to get directly into
protocols, meaning tools. We're also going to talk about ways in which
the auditory and balance system suffer. We're going to talk about
tinnitus, which is this ringing of the ears that, unfortunately, for
people that suffer from it, they really suffer. It's very intrusive
for them. We're going to talk about some treatments that can work in
some circumstances and some of the more recent emerging treatments
that I think many people aren't aware of. We're also going to talk
about this, what seems like kind of a weird fact, which is that 70% of
people, all people, make what are called otoacoustic emissions, their
ears actually make noises. Chances are your ears are making noises
right now, but you can't perceive them. And yet those can have an
influence on other people and animals in your environment. It's a
fascinating aspect of your biology. You're going to learn a lot about
how your biology and brain and ears and the so-called inner ear that's
associated with balance, you're going to learn a lot about how all
those work, you're going to learn a lot of neuroscience. I'll even
tell you what type of music to listen to. And if you listen to me, you
can leverage that in order to learn faster. Before we begin talking
about the science of hearing and balance and tools that leverage
hearing and balance for learning faster, I want to provide some
information about another way to learn much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=140"&gt;Protocol: New Data for Rapid Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a paper that was published recently. This is a paper that was
published in Cell Reports, an excellent journal. It's a peer-reviewed
paper from a really excellent group, looking at skill-learning. Now,
previously, I've talked about how, in the attempt to learn skills, the
vital thing to do is to get lots of repetitions. You've heard of the
10,000 hours thing, you've heard of lots of different strategies for
learning faster, 80/20 rule and all that; the bottom line is you need
to generate many, many repetitions of something that you're trying to
learn. And the errors that you generate are also very important for
learning. It also turns out that taking rest within the learning
episode is very important. I want to be really clear what I'm
referring to here. In earlier episodes, I've discussed how when you're
trying to learn something it's beneficial, it's been shown in
scientific studies, that if you take a 20-minute shallow nap or you
simply do nothing after a period of learning, that it enhances the
rates of learning and the depth of learning, your ability to learn and
remember that information. What I'm about to describe are new data
that say that you actually should be injecting rest within the
learning episode. Now I'm not talking about going to sleep while
learning. This is the way that the study was done: the study involved,
having people learn sequences of numbers or keys on a piano. So let's
use the keys on a piano example. I'm not a musician, but I think I'll
get this correct. They asked people to practice a sequence of keys,
G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G. And they would practice that either
continually for a given amount of time, or they would just do that for
10 seconds, they would play G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G
for 10 seconds. And then they would take a 10-second pause or rest.
They would just space take a space or a period of time where they do
nothing for 10 seconds then they would go back to G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-
E-G. So the two conditions, essentially, were to have people practice
continually, lots of repetitions, or to inject or insert these periods
of 10 seconds idle time where they're not doing anything, they're not
looking at their phone, they're not focusing on anything, they're just
letting their mind drift wherever it wants to go and they are not
touching the keys on the keyboard. What they found was that the rates
of learning, the skill acquisition and the retention of the skill was
significantly faster when they injected these short periods of rest,
these 10-second rest periods. And the rates of learning were, when I
say significantly faster, were much, much faster. I'll reveal what
that was in just a moment, but you might ask why would this work? Why
would it be that injecting these 10-second rest periods would enhance
rates of learning? What they called them was micro-offline gains
because they're taking their brain offline from the learning task for
a moment. Well, turns out the brain isn't going offline at all. You've
probably heard of the hippocampus, the area of the brain involved in
memory and the neocortex, the area of the brain that's involved in
processing sensory information. Well, it turns out that during these
brief periods of rest, these 10-second rest periods, the hippocampus
and the cortex are active in ways such that you get a 20 times repeat
of the G-D-F-E-G. It's a temporal compression, as they say. So
basically, the rehearsal continues while you rest, but at 20 times the
speed. So if you were normally getting just, let's just say five
repetitions of G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G per 10 seconds. Now you
multiply that times 20. In the rest periods, you've practiced it 100
times. Your brain has practiced it. We know this because they were
doing brain imaging, functional imaging of these people with brain
scanners while they were doing this. This is an absolutely staggering
effect and it's one that, believe it or not, has been hypothesized or
thought to exist for a very long time. This effect is called the
spacing effect. And it was actually first proposed by Ebbington in
1885. And since then, it's been demonstrated for a huge number of
different, what they call domains, in the cognitive domain. So for
learning languages, in the physical domain, so for learning skills
that involve a motor sequence. It's been demonstrated for a huge
number of different categories of learning. If you want to learn all
about the spacing effect and the categories of learning that it can
impact, there's a wonderful review article. I'll provide a link to it.
The title of the review article is parallels between spacing effects
during behavioral and cellular learning. What that review really does
is it ties the behavioral learning and the improvement of skill to the
underlying changes in neurons that can explain that learning. I should
mention that the paper that I'm referring to, the more recent paper
that injects these 10-second little micro-offline gains, rest periods
is the work of the laboratory of Leonard Cohen, not the musician,
Leonard Cohen. He passed away, he was not a neuroscientist; a
wonderful poet and musician, but not a neuroscientist. Again, the
paper was published in Cell Reports and we will provide a link to the
full paper as well. So the takeaway is if you're trying to learn
something, you need to get those reps in, but one way that you can get
20 times, the number of reps in is by injecting these little 10-second
periods of doing nothing. Again, during those rest periods, you really
don't want to attend to anything else, as much as possible. You could
close your eyes if you want, or you can just simply wait and then get
right back into generating repetitions. I find these papers that Cell
Reports and other journals have been publishing recently to be
fascinating because they're really helping us understand what are the
best protocols for learning anything. And they really leverage the
fact that the brain is willing to generate repetitions for us,
provided that we give it the rest that it needs. So inject rest
throughout the learning period. And if you can, based on the
scientific data, you would also want to take a 20-minute nap or a
20-minute decompress period where you're not doing anything after a
period of learning. I think those could both synergize in order to
enhance learning even further, although that hasn't been looked at
yet. Before we begin talking about hearing and balance, I just want to
mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research
roles at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=550"&gt;Introduction: Hearing &amp;amp; Balance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost to
consumer information about science and science related tools to the
general public. In keeping with that theme, I want to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast and make it clear that we only work with
sponsors whose products we absolutely love, and that we think you will
benefit from as well. Our first sponsor is Roka. Roka makes sunglasses
and eyeglasses, that, in my opinion are the very highest quality
available. The company was founded by two all-American swimmers from
Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses were
created with performance in mind. These eyeglasses and sunglasses have
a number of features that really make them unique. First of all,
they're extremely lightweight, the optical clarity of the lenses is
spectacular. And for the sunglasses, they have this really great
feature, which is as you move in and out of shadows, or across the
day, the amount of sunshine might change, you always experience the
world as clear and bright, and that can only come from really
understanding how the visual system works. The visual system has all
these mechanisms for adaptation and habituation. You don't need to
know how those things work, but the folks at Roka clearly do because
you put these glasses on and you don't even notice that they're on.
They also stay on your face even if you get sweaty. They were designed
to be used while active, so running and biking, et cetera or indoors.
One thing that I really like about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses is
that the aesthetic is terrific. Even though they were designed for
performance, unlike a lot of sunglasses out there that were designed
for performance that look kind of ridiculous, kind of space-age, Roka
eyeglasses and sunglasses, you could wear anywhere. The aesthetic is
really clean and they have a huge number of different styles to select
from. If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses, you can go to Roka, that's

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and
reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular
blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that
impact our immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a
quality blood test. And now with the advent of DNA tests, we can get
further insight and information into how our metabolism is working,
how our brain is functioning, how our endocrine system, meaning our
hormone system is functioning. One of the issues with a lot of
companies and programs that involve getting blood and DNA tests,
however, is that you get the information back, you don't know what to
do with that information. With InsideTracker, they make all of that
very easy. First of all, they can send someone to your home to take
the samples, if you like or you can go to a local clinic. You get the
information back and, of course, you get all the numbers and levels of
hormone factors, metabolic factors, et cetera, but the dashboard at
InsideTracker provides directives so that if you want to bring those
numbers up or bring them down, or if you want to keep them in the same
range, it points to specific regimens related to nutrition, exercise,
and other lifestyle factors so you can really move around those
numbers to best suit your health goals and health status. If you want
to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman, and
you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code

Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that's backed by 25 published
studies. And in addition to those, there are hundreds of studies
showing that meditation is beneficial for our brain and for our body.
One of the challenges, however, is maintaining a meditation practice.
I started meditating a long time ago, but I found it very hard to keep
that practice going. Then I discovered the Headspace meditation app
and what I found was that because they have meditations that are very
short, as well as some that are longer and some that are much longer,
I could maintain my meditation practice. Sometimes I do a short five-
minute meditation, sometimes I do 20-minute meditation, I try and
meditate at least 20 minutes per day, but sometimes, some weeks, I
only do it five times a week and I'll just meditate for longer. So
with Headspace, you have the full palette of meditations to select
from. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to
headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get a free one-
month trial so no cost whatsoever, with their full library of
meditations. So that's the best offer that they have. So, again, if
you want to try Headspace and you want to get access to all their
meditations for free go to headspace.com/specialoffer. Can you hear
me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=833"&gt;How We Perceive Sounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you hear me? Okay, well, if you can hear me, that's amazing
because what it means is that my voice is causing little tiny changes
in the airwaves wherever you happen to be. And that your ears and
whatever's contained in those ears and in your brain can take those
sound waves and make sense of them. And that is an absolutely
fantastic and staggering feat of biology and yet we understand a lot
about how that process works. So I'm going to teach it to you now in
simple terms over the next few minutes. So what we call ears have a
technical name. That technical name is oracles, but more often they're
called pinna, the pinnas, P-I-N-N-A, pinna. And the pinnas of your
ears, this outer part that is made of cartilage and stuff is arranged
such that it can capture sound in the best way for your head size.
We're going to talk about ear size also, 'cause it turns out that your
ears change size across the lifespan and that how big your ears are or
rather how fast your ears are changing size is a pretty good
indication of how fast you're aging. So we'll get to that in a few
minutes, but I want to talk about these things that we call ears and
some of the stuff contained within them that allow us to hear. So the
shape of these ears that we have is such that it amplifies high-
frequency sounds. High frequency sounds, as the name suggests, is the
squeakier stuff. So low frequency sound, Costello snoring in the
background that's a low frequency sound or high frequency sound, okay?
So we have low frequency sounds and high frequency sounds and
everything in between. Now those sound waves get captured by our ears.
And those sound waves, for those of you that don't maybe fully
conceptualize sound waves, are literally just fluctuations or shifts
in the way that air is moving toward your ear and through space. In
the same way that water can have waves, air can have waves. So it's
reverberation of air. Those come in through your ears and you have
what's called your eardrum. And on the inside of your eardrum, there's
a little bony thing that shaped like a little hammer. So attached to
that eardrum, which can move back and forth like a drum, it's a little
membrane, you got this hammer attached to it. And that hammer has
three parts. For those of you that want to know, those three parts are
called malleus, incus and stapes. But basically, you can just think
about it as a hammer. So you've got this eardrum and then a hammer.
And then that hammer has to hammer on something. And what it does is
it hammers on a little coiled piece of tissue that we call the
cochlea, sometimes called the cochlea, depending on where somebody
lives in the country. So, typically, in the Midwest, on the East
Coast, they call them coh-chleah. And on the West Coast, we call them
caw-cochlea, same thing. So this snail-shaped structure in your inner
ear is where sound gets converted into electrical signals that the
brain can understand. But I want to just bring your attention to that
little hammer because that little hammer is really, really cool. What
it means is that sound waves come in through your ears, that's what's
happening right now, that eardrum that you have, it's like the top of
a drum. It's like a membrane, or it can move back and forth. It's not
super rigid and it moves that little hammer. And then the hammer goes,
doom-doom-doom-doom and hits this coil-shaped thing that we're calling
the cochlea. Now the cochlea, at one end, is more rigid than the
other. So one part can move really easily and the other part doesn't
move very easily. And that turns out to be very important for decoding
or separating sounds that are low frequency like Costello's snoring
and sounds that are of high frequency, like a shriek or a shrill. And
that's because within that little coil thing, we call the cochlea, you
have all these tiny little what are called hair cells. Now they look
like hairs, but they're not at all related to the hairs on your head
or elsewhere on your body. They're just shaped like hair, so we call
them hair cells. Those hair cells, if they move, send signals into the
brain that a particular sound is in our environment. And if those hair
cells don't move, it means that particular sound is not in our
environment. So just to give you the mental picture of this, sound
waves are coming in, because there's stuff out there, making noises
like my voice; it's changing the patterns of air around you in very,
very subtle ways; that information is getting funneled into your ears
because your pinnas are shaped in a particular way. The eardrum then
moves this little hammer and the hammer bangs on this little snail-
shaped thing. And because that snail-shaped thing, at one end, is very
rigid, it doesn't want to move and at the other end, it's very
flexible, it can separate out high-frequency and low-frequency sounds.
And the fact that this thing in your inner ear that we call the
cochlea is coiled, is actually really important to understand because
along its length, it varies in how rigid or flexible it is, I already
mentioned that before and at the base, it's very rigid and that's
where the hair cells, if they move, will make high-frequency sounds,
and at the top, what's called the apex, it's very flexible and it's
more like a bass drum. So basically what happens is sound waves come
into your ears and then at one end of this thing that we call the
cochlea, at the top, it's essentially encoding or only responding to
sounds that are like, doom-doom-doom-doom. Whereas, at the bottom, it
responds to high-frequency sounds like a cymbal, [clanging]. And
everywhere in between, we have other frequencies, medium frequencies.
Now this should stagger your mind. If it doesn't already, it should.
Because what this means is that everything that's happening around us,
whether or not it's music or voices or crying or screaming or
screaming of delight from small children who are excited, 'cause
they're playing or 'cause they get cake; all of that is being broken
down into its component parts and then your brain is making sense of
what it means. These things that I've been talking about, like the
pinna of your ears and this little hammer and the cochlea, that's all
purely mechanical. It has no mind of its own. It's just breaking
things down into high frequencies, medium frequencies and low
frequencies. And if you don't understand sound frequency, it's really
simple to understand, just imagine ripples on a pond. And if those
ripples are very close together, that's high frequency; they occur at
high frequency. If those ripples are further apart, it's low
frequency. And obviously, medium frequency is in between. So just like
you can have waves in water, you can have waves in air. So that's
really how it works. Now we are all familiar with light and how, if
you take a prism and put it in front of light, it will split that
light into its different wavelengths, its different colors, red,
green, blue, et cetera. So like the Pink Floyd "Dark Side of the Moon"
album, I think, has a prism and it's converting white light into all
the colors, all the wavelengths that are contained in white light.
Your cochlea, essentially, acts as a prism. It takes all the sound in
your environment and it splits up those sounds into different
frequencies. So you can think of the cochlea of your ear, sort of like
a prism and then the brain takes that information and puts it back
together and makes sense of it. So those hair cells in each of your
two cochlea,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=1316"&gt;Your Hearing Brain (Areas)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because you have two ears, you also have two cochlea, send little
wires, what we call axons that convey their patterns of activity into
the brain. And there are a number of different stations within the
brain that information arrives at before it gets up to the parts of
your brain, where you are consciously aware. And because some of you
have asked for more names and nomenclature, I'll give that to you. If
you don't want a lot of detailed names, you can just ignore what I'm
about to say. But, basically, the cochlea send information to what's
called the spiral ganglion. A ganglion, by the way, if you're going to
learn any neuroscience, just know that anytime you hear ganglion, a
ganglion is just a clump, so it means a bunch of neurons. So a clump
of cells. So the spiral ganglion is a bunch of neurons that the
information then goes off to what are called the cochlear nuclei in
the brainstem. Brainstem is down near your neck, then up to a
structure that has a really cool name called the superior olive,
because you have one on each side of your brain. And if I were to
bring you to my lab and show you the superior olives in your brain or
anyone else's brain, they look like little olives, even that little
divot in them that to me, it looks like a pimiento, but they just call
them the superior olive. And then the neurons in the superior olive,
then they send information up to what's called the inferior
colliculus, only called inferior because it sits below a structure
called the superior colliculus. And then the information goes up to
what's called the medial geniculate nucleus. And then up to your
neocortex where you make sense of it all. Now you don't have to
remember all that, but you should know that there are a lot of
stations in which auditory information is processed before it gets up
to our conscious detection. And there is a good reason for that, which
is that more important than knowing what you're hearing, you need to
know where it's coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=1428"&gt;Localizing Sounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's vital to our survival, that if something, for instance, is
falling toward us, that we know if it's coming to our right side, if
it's going to hit us from behind, we have to know, for instance, if a
car is coming at us from our left or from our right. And our visual
system can help with that. But our auditory and our visual system
collaborate to help us find and locate the position of things in
space. That should come as no surprise. If you hear somebody talking
off to your right, you tend to turn to your right, not to your left.
If you see somebody's mouth moving in front of you, you tend to assume
that the sound is going to come from right in front of you.
Disruptions in this auditory hearing and visual matching are actually
the basis of what's called the ventriloquism effect, which we'll talk
about in a few minutes in more depth. But the ventriloquism effect can
basically be described in simple terms as when you essentially think
that a sound is coming from a location that it's not actually coming
from. We'll talk about that in a moment but what I'd like you to
realize is that one of these stations, deep in your brainstem is
responsible for helping you identify where sounds are coming from
through a process that's called interaural time differences. And that
sounds fancy, but really, the way you know where things are coming
from, what direction a car or a boss or a person is coming from is
because the sound lands in one ear before the other. And you have
stations in your brain, meaning you have neurons in your brain that
calculate the difference in time of arrival for those sound waves in
your right versus your left ear. And if they arrive at the same time,
you assume that thing is making noise right in front of you. If it's
off to your right, you assume it's over on your right. And if the
sound arrives first to your left ear, you assume, quite correctly,
that the thing is coming toward your left ear. So it's a very simple
and mechanical system at the level of sound localization. But what
about up and down? If you think about it, a sound coming from above is
going to land on your right ear and your left ear at the same time. A
sound from below is going to land on your right ear and your left ear
at the same time. So the way that we know where things are in terms of
what's called elevation, where they are in the up and down plane is by
the frequencies. The shape of your ears actually modifies the sound
depending on whether or not it's coming straight at you, from the
floor or from high above. And so already at the level of your ears,
you are taking information about the outside world and determining
where that information is coming from. Now, this all happens very,
very fast and it's subconscious but now you know why if people really
want to hear something, they make a cup around their ear. They
essentially make their ear into more of a fennec fox type ear. If
you've ever seen those cute little fennec fox things, they have these
big spiky ears, they look like a French bulldog, although the fox
version version of the French bulldog. This big, tall ears, and they
have excellent sound localization. And so when people lean in with
their ear, with their hand like this, if you're listening to this, I'm
just cupping my hand at my ear, I'm giving myself a bigger pinna. And
if I do it on the left side, I can do this side. And if I really want
to hear something, I do it on both sides. So this isn't just
gesturing, this actually serves a mechanical role. And actually, if
you want to hear where things are coming from with a much greater
degree of accuracy, this can actually help because you're capturing
sound waves and funneling them better. It's really remarkable, this
whole system. So you've got these two ears and because of the
differences in the timing of when things arrive in those two ears, as
well as these differences in the frequencies that certain things
sound, or I should say the differences in the frequencies that arrive
at your ears, depending on whether or not the thing is above you or
right in front of you or below you, you're able to make out where
things are in space pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=1680"&gt;Ear Movement: What It Means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you're probably starting to realize that these two things on
the side of our head that we call ears are there for a lot more than
hanging earrings on or for other aesthetic purposes or for putting
sunglasses on top of. They are very powerful devices for allowing us
to capture sound waves from our environment. Now I have a question for
you, which is, can you move your ears? It turns out that unlike other
animals, humans are not terrifically good at moving their ears. Other
animals can move their ears even independently. So Costello is pretty
good at raising his ears, the two of them together, He can't really
move his ear separately. Some dogs can do that really well. In fact,
sighthounds and some scenthounds do that exquisitely well. Some
animals like deer and other animals that really have very acute
hearing will put one ear down to a very particular angle and will tilt
the other one and they will actually capture information about two
distant sound-making organisms, those could be hunters coming after
them or other animals coming after them. They are very good at doing
this. We're not so good at it. But about 60% of people, it's thought,
can move their ears consciously without having to touch their ear. So
can you do that? Maybe you should try it. Ask someone to look at you
and see whether or not you can do it. The typical distances that
people can move it is usually no more than two or three millimeters.
It's subtle but can you flap your pinna with just using mental
control? If you can, or if you can't, try looking all the way to your
right or all the way to your left. Obviously, if you're driving a car
or doing something or exercising, don't put yourself in danger right
now. But if you move your eyes all the way to your left, which I'm
doing now or all the way to my right, you might feel a little bit of a
contraction of the muscles that control ear movement. Now I want to
ask you this: can you raise one eyebrow? I'm not very good at it, I
can do a little bit, but it's mostly by like cramping down my face on
one side. And I certainly can't raise my right eyebrow. I can only do
my left eyebrow. Trying to talk while I'm doing this, that's why it
looks strange. People who can raise one eyebrow very easily, almost
always, can move their ears without having to touch them. It's
controlled by the same motor pathway. And there does seem to be a
small, but statistically significant sex difference in the ability to
move one's ears. Typically, men can do this more than women can,
although plenty of women can move their ears as well. Now, if you
think that is all a little strange or off topic, it's not because what
we're really talking about here is a system of the brain, but also of
the body of the musculature for localizing things in space. And so you
might find it interesting to note that one of the things that we share
very closely with other primates, with non-human primates, like
macaque monkeys and chimpanzees, if you look at their ears, their ears
are remarkably similar to our ears, or rather our ears are remarkably
similar to their ears. The eyes of certain monkeys like macaque
monkeys are remarkably similar to human eyes. This is one of the
reasons why, if you look at a baby macaque monkey, it has this
unbelievably human element to it. But the ears of these primates is
very similar to our ears; our ears, similar to their ears. If you're
interested in ear movements and what they could mean and some of the
things that ear movements correlate with in other aspects of our
biology, there's a nice paper, actually, a scientific paper. The
author's last name is Code, C-O-D-E, it was published in 1995. I'll
give a reference to that. It's a review article that discusses some of
the sex differences in ear movement control, as well as the
relationship between ear movements and eye movements. And it's a
pretty accessible paper. It's one that I think any of you who are
interested in this topic could parse fairly easily. And there's some
very interesting underlying biology and some theories as to why humans
would have this so-called vestigial or ancient carry-over of a system
for moving our ears. Now, if ear movement seems strange, next, I want
to talk about a different feature of your hearing and ears that's even
stranger, but that has some really interesting implications for your
biology. And I'm guessing that you've not heard of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=1980"&gt;Your Ears (Likely) Make Sounds: Role of Hormones, Sexual Orientation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I about to describe are called otoacoustic emissions. And
otoacoustic emissions, as the name suggests, are sounds that your ears
make. Believe it or not, 70% of people make noises with their ears,
but they don't actually detect them. Like I said, you've never heard
of this. Okay, that's not what I mean. But what I do mean is that 70%
of people's ears are making noise that's cast out of the ear. And
these otoacoustic emissions, actually, can be detected by microphones.
Sometimes they can be detected by other people in the room if they
have very good hearing. Now, it turns out that women or, I should be
technical here, females who report themselves as heterosexual, have a
higher frequency, not frequency of sound, but a higher frequency of
otoacoustic emissions than do men who report themselves as
heterosexual. Women who report themselves as homosexual or bisexual,
make fewer otoacoustic emissions than heterosexual women. These are
data that come from Dennis McFadden's lab at the University of Texas,
Austin. He actually discovered these, what are called sexual
dimorphisms and differences based on sexual orientation without
looking for them. He was studying hearing. He's a auditory scientist
and people were coming into his laboratory and they were detecting
these otoacoustic emissions. And they started to notice the group
differences in otoacoustic emissions. So they started asking people
about their sex and about their sexual orientation. And these
differences fell out of the data, as we say. And it's interesting
because otoacoustic emissions are not something that we associate with
sex or sexual dimorphism. But what these data really underscore is,
first of all, a lot of us are making noises with our ears, some of us
more than others. And that exposure to certain combinations of
hormones during development are very likely shaping the way that our
hearing apparati, meaning the cochlea and the pinna and all sorts of
things, how those develop and how those functions throughout the
lifespan. We did do an episode on hormones and sexual development,
which gets much deeper into the other effects that hormones have on
the developing brain and body. If you want to check out that episode,
we will put a link to it in the captions. So now I want to shift to
talking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=2130"&gt;Binaural Beats: Do They Work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about ways to leverage your hearing system, your auditory system so
that you can learn anything, not just auditory information, but
anything faster. I get a lot of questions about so-called binaural
beats. Binaural beats, as their name suggests, involve playing one
frequency of sound to one ear and a different frequency of sound to
the other ear. So it might be doomed, doon, doon, doon to your right
ear, and it might be to ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding to the left ear.
And the idea is that the brain will take those two frequencies of
sound and because the pathways that bring information from the ears
into the brain, eventually crossover, they actually share that
information with both sides of the brain, that the brain will average
that information and come up with this sort of intermediate frequency.
And the rationale is that those intermediate frequencies place the
brain into a state that is better for learning. And when I say better
for learning, I want to be precise about what I mean. That could mean
more focus for encoding or bringing the information in. As you may
have heard me say before, we have to be alert and focused in order to
learn. There is no passive learning unless we're little tiny infants.
So can binaural beats make us more focused? Can binaural beats allow
us to relax more if we're anxious? I know some people, they go to the
dentist and the dentist offers binaural beats as they drill into your
teeth and give root canals and things of that sort, probably causing
some anxiety just describing those things right now. But those are
available in many dental practices. Binaural beats have been thought
to increase creativity, or at least they have been proposed to
increase creativity. So what does the scientific data say about
binaural beats? There are a number of different apps out there that
offer binaural beats. There are a number of different programs. I
think you can also even just find these on YouTube and on the
internet. But typically, it's an app and you'll program in a
particular outcome that you want: more focused, more creative, fall
asleep, less anxious, et cetera. So what does the scientific data say?
So believe it or not, the science on binaural beats is actually quite
extensive and very precise. So sound waves are measured, typically, in
hertz or kilohertz. I know many of you aren't familiar with thinking
about things in hertz or kilohertz. But again, just remember those
waves on a pond, those ripples on a pond. If they're close together,
then they are of high-frequency. And if they're far apart, than they
are of low frequency. So when you hear more hertz, what you're
essentially hearing is higher frequency. And so if it's many more
kilohertz then it's much higher frequency than if it's fewer hertz or
kilohertz. And so you may have heard of these things as delta waves or
theta waves or alpha waves or beta waves, et cetera. Delta waves would
be big, slow waves, so low frequency. And, indeed, there is quality
evidence from peer-reviewed studies that are not sponsored by
companies that make binaural beat apps that tell us that delta waves
like one to four hertz, so very low frequency sounds, think Costello's
snoring, can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep.
And that theta rhythms, which are more like four to eight hertz can
bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep or meditation, so deeply
relaxed, but not fully asleep. And then you can sort of ascend the
staircase of findings here, so to speak. And you'll find evidence that
alpha waves, eight to 13 hertz can increase alertness to a moderate
level. That's a great state for the brain to be in for recall of
existing information. And that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz are great
for bringing the brain into focus states for sustained thought or for
incorporating new information and especially gamma waves, the highest
frequency, the most frequent ripples of sound, so to speak, 32 to 100
hertz for learning and problem-solving. Now, all of this matches, or I
should say, maps onto what I've said before about learning really
nicely, which is that you need to be in a highly alert state in order
to bring new information in, in order to access a state of mind in
which you can tell your brain or the brain is telling itself, okay, I
need to learn this. This is why stress and unfortunate circumstances
are so memorable is because our brain gets into a really high alert
system. Here, we're talking about the use of binaural beats in order
to increase our level of alertness or our level of calmness. Now
that's important to underscore because it's not that there's something
fundamentally important about the binaural beats. They are yet another
way of bringing the brain into states of deep relaxation through low
frequency sound or highly alert states for focused learning with more
high-frequency sound. So they are effective and I'll review a little
bit of the data in detail, they're effective, but it's not that
they're uniquely special for learning. It's just that they can help
some people bring their brain into the state that allows them to learn
better. So there are a lot of studies that allowed us to arrive, or I
should say allowed the field to arrive on these parameters of slow,
slow, low frequency waves are going to bring you into relaxed states,
high frequency waves into more alert states. There's very good
evidence for anxiety reduction from the use of binaural beats. And
what's interesting is anxiety reduction seems to be most effective
when the binaural beats are bringing the brain into delta, so those
slow big waves like sleep, theta and alpha states. And I'll link to a
couple of these studies although I will probably link more to the list
that really segregates them out one by one so you can see them all
next to one another. There's good evidence that binaural beats can be
used to treat pain, chronic pain. There's three studies in peer-
reviewed journals which I took a look at, and they seem to be of good
quality, not sponsored research, as we say, not paid for by any
specific company. Binaural beats have been shown to modestly improve
cognition, attention, working memory and even creativity. But the real
boost from binaural beats appears to be for anxiety reduction and pain
reduction. Some people might find these beneficial for these oral
surgeries, right? Believe it or not, there are people who would rather
have the entire root canal or cavity drilled without Novocaine. And
that's because they sometimes have a syringe phobia or something of
that sort or they just don't like being numb from the Novocaine, or
maybe there's an underlying medical reason. But I think most people do
don't enjoy getting their teeth drilled even if they have Novocaine in
there or a root canal. And so it seems that binaural beats can be
effective in that environment. And you don't have to go into that sort
of extreme environment to benefit from binaural beats. Binaural beats
are a either relatively inexpensive thing to access, most of the apps
are pretty inexpensive. I don't have a favorite binaural beats app to
recommend to you. I confess I did use binaural beats a few years ago.
I shifted over to other what I call NSDR, non-sleep deep rest
protocols in favor of those, but many people like binaural beats and
say that they benefit from them, especially while studying or
learning. I think part of the reason for that relates to the ability
to channel our focus when we have some background noise. And this is
something I also get asked about a lot. Is it better to listen to
music and have background noise when studying or is it better to have
complete silence? Well, there's actually a quite good literature on
this as well, but not so much as it relates to binaural beats, but
rather whether or not people are listening to music, so-called white
noise, brown noise; believe it or not, there's white noise and there's
brown noise, there's even pink noise and how that impacts brain states
that allow us to learn information better or not. So now I'd like to
talk about white noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=2634"&gt;White Noise Can Enhance Learning &amp;amp; Dopamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I want to be very clear that white noise has been shown to really
enhance brain states for learning in certain individuals, in
particular, in adults. But white noise actually can have a detrimental
effect on auditory learning and maybe even the development of the
auditory system in very young children in particular in infants. So
first I'd like to talk about the beneficial effects of white noise on
learning. There are some really excellent studies on this. The first
one that I'd like to just highlight is one that's entitled: Low
Intensity White Noise Improves Performance in Auditory Working Memory
Task, an fMRI Study. This is a study that explored whether or not
learning could be enhanced by playing white noise in the background.
But the strength of the study is that they looked at some of the
underlying neural circuitry and the activation of the neural circuitry
in these people as they did the learning task. And what it,
essentially, illustrates is that white noise, provided that white
noise is of low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, not
imperceptible, so not so quiet that you can't hear it, but not super
loud either, it actually could enhance learning to a significant
degree. And this has been shown now for a huge number of different
types of learning. There's a terrific article as well in a somewhat
obscure journal, at least, obscure to me, which is: The Effects of
Noise Exposure on Cognitive Performance and Brain Activity Patterns.
That's a study involving 54 subjects. They, basically, were evaluated
for mental workload and attention under different levels of noise
exposure, background noise and different, essentially, loudness of
noise. And the reason I like this study is that they looked at
different levels of noise and types of noise, and they varied a number
of different things, as opposed to just doing a two-condition, either
white noise or no white noise type thing. And what they found, again,
is that provided the white noise is not extremely loud, it could
really enhance brain function for sake of learning any number of
different kinds of information. Now that's all great, but it really
doesn't get to the deeper guts of mechanism. And as a neuroscientist,
what I really want to see is not just that something has an effect.
That's always nice. It's always nice to see in a nice peer-reviewed
study without any kind of commercial biases that there's an effect,
binaural beats can enhance learning or listening to white noise, not
too loud can enhance learning. But you really want to understand
mechanism because once you understand mechanism, not only does it
start to make sense, but you can also imagine ways in which you could
develop better tools and protocols. So I was very relieved to find, or
I should say excited to find this study published in the Journal of
Cognitive Neuroscience, this is a 2014 paper, White Noise Improves
Learning by Modulating Activity in Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions and
Right Superior Temporal Sulcus. Now I don't expect you to know what
the right spirit temporal sulcus is. I don't expect you to know what
the dopamine midbrain region is, but if you're like me, you probably
took highlighted notice of the word dopaminergic. Dopamine is a
neuromodulator, meaning it's a chemical that's released in our brain
and body, but mostly in our brain that modulates, meaning controls the
likelihood that certain brain areas will be active and other brain
areas won't be active. And dopamine is associated with motivation.
Dopamine is associated with craving. Motivation is associated with all
sorts of different things, including movement but what this study so
nicely shows is that white noise can really enhance the activity of
neurons in what's called the substantia nigra VTA. The substantia
nigra VTA is a very rich source of dopamine and that's because it's
very chockablock full of dopamine neurons. It's an area of the brain
that is, perhaps, the richest source of dopamine neurons. And you
actually can see this brain region under the microscope if you take a
slice of brain or you look at a brain without even staining it for any
proteins or dopamine or anything. It's two very dark regions at the
bottom of the brain. And the reason it's called substantia nigra,
nigra meaning dark is because the dopamine neurons actually make
something that makes those neurons dark. And so you've got these two
regions down there, that contain dopamine and can release dopamine
and, essentially, activate other brain regions and activate our sense
of motivation and activate our sense of desire to continue focusing
and learning. But you can't just snap your fingers and make them
release dopamine. You actually have to trigger dopamine release from
them. Now that trigger can be caused by being very excited about
something or the fact that that thing gave you a lot of pleasure in
the past, or you're highly motivated by fear or desire. But what's so
interesting to me is that it appears that white noise itself can raise
what we call the basal, the baseline levels of dopamine that are being
released from this area, the substantia nigra. So now we're starting
to get a more full picture of how particular sounds in our environment
can increase learning. And that's, in part, I believe, through the
release of dopamine from substantia nigra. So I'm not trying to shift
you away from binaural beats, if that's your thing, but it does appear
that turning on white noise at a low level, not too loud. You may say,
"Well, how loud?" And I'll tell you in a moment, but not too loud can
allow you to learn better because of the ways that it's modulating
your brain chemistry. So how loud or how soft should that white noise
be while you learn? Well, in these studies, it seemed that white noise
that could be heard by the person, so it wasn't imperceptible to them,
so it was loud enough that they could hear, but not so loud that they
felt it was intrusive or irritating to them. So that's going to differ
from person to person because people have different levels of auditory
sensitivity. It's going to depend on age, going to depend on a number
of different factors. So I can't tell you turn to level two on your
volume controller. That's just not going to work. Also, I don't know
how far you are from a given speaker in the room or if you've got
earphones in your head or you've got speakers in the room or if it's
coming out of your computer. I don't know those things. So what you're
going to have to do is adjust that white noise to the place where it's
not interfering with your ability to focus, but rather it's enhancing
your ability to focus. I think a good rule of thumb is going to be to
put it probably on the lower third of any kind of volume dial, as
opposed to in the upper third, where it would really be blasting. And
really blasting any noise, frankly, is not good, but that's especially
not good, meaning it's especially bad if you have headphones in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=3060"&gt;Headphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to mention something about headphones before I talk about
white noise in the developmental context and why it can be dangerous
there. When you put headphones in your ears, it has this incredible
effect of making the sounds like they come from inside your head, not
from out in the room. And now that might seem like kind of a duh, but
that's actually really amazing, right? Your brain assumes that the
sounds are coming from inside your head, as opposed from the
environment that you're in the moment you put headphones in. So if
you're listening to an audiobook or maybe you're listening to this
podcast with headphones, that's very different than when you're
listening to something out in the room and there are other sounds,
other sound waves, especially if you use these noise-cancellation
headphones. So if you're going to use white noise to enhance studying
or learning of any kind, this also could be for skill-learning, motor
skill-learning while you're exercising, my suggestion would be that if
you're using headphones, to keep it quite low. This is an effect on
the midbrain dopamine neurons that's a background effect of raising
the baseline of dopamine release. The way that dopamine neurons fires,
they're always firing; yours are firing right now, so are mine, when
something exciting happens, they fire a lot. And when something
disappointing happens, that firing, the release of dopamine goes down
below baseline. What you're talking about here is raising your overall
levels of attention and motivation, which translate to better learning
by just tickling those neurons a little bit, raising the baseline
firing. You're not turning up the white noise to the point where
you're feeling amazing. This isn't like turning on your favorite song.
This is actually the opposite. This is about getting that baseline up
just a bit. So I recommend turning the volume up just a bit so that
you can focus entirely on the task that you're trying to do. And, of
course, you've turned on white noise so your attention might drift to
that for a moment. Is it too loud? Is it too soft? If you can
disappear into the work, so to speak, if your attention can disappear
into the work, then that's probably sufficiently quiet. And for those
of you that say, well, I like really loud music and if I just blast
the music, then I forget about the music. I don't suggest blasting
music. And this is coming from somebody who really likes loud music. I
grew up with kind of a loud fast rules mentality, and if you don't
know what loud fast rules means, then I can't help you, but there's a
time and a place, perhaps, to listen to music loud but, especially,
with headphones, you can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite
rapidly. And unfortunately, because these hair cells that we talked
about earlier, our central nervous system neurons, they do not
regenerate, they do not come back. Now along the lines of hearing
loss, I should just say that the best way to blow out your hearing for
good, to eliminate your hearing is to have very loud sounds super
imposed on a loud environment. So loud environments can cause hearing
loss over time. So if you work at a construction site, clanging really
loud, or if you work the sound board in a club or something, you are
headed towards hearing loss unless you protect your hearing with
earplugs and headphones. Nowadays, some of the ear plugs are very low
profile, meaning you can't see them. So that's kind of nice, so you're
not like the, when I was younger, like you didn't want to be the dork
to go to the concert with the earplugs, but it turns out those dorks
were smarter than everybody else, because they're not the ones who are
craning their neck to try and hear trivial things at the age of 30 or
so 'cause they blew out their hearing. So if you are working in a loud
environment or you expose yourselves to a loud environment, you really
want to avoid big inflections in sound above that. So loud environment
plus fireworks, loud environment plus gunshot, loud environments plus
very high-frequency intense sound, that's what we call the two-hit
model, this is also true for concussion, that you can take a stimulus
that normally would be below the threshold of injury, you add another
stimulus at the same time, that would be below the threshold of
injury. And then, suddenly, you killed the neurons. So I don't want to
make people paranoid, but you do want to protect your hearing. It's no
fun to lose your hearing. If you're going to use headphones and you
feel like you want to crank it up all the way, just remember that the
more that you can get out of a lower volume, meaning the longer that
you can go listening to things at lower volume, the longer you'll be
able to hear that music or that thing. So again, I'm not the hearing
cop. That's not my job, but as somebody who's lost some of his high-
frequency hearing, I can tell you it's not a pleasure. The old
argument that it helps you not have to hear or listen to people that
you don't want to listen to, that does it doesn't really work. They
just send you text messages instead. So what about white noise and
hearing loss in development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=3351"&gt;White Noise During Development: Possibly Harmful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people with children have these noise machines like
sound waves and things like that, that help the kids sleep. And look,
I think kids getting good sleep and parents getting good sleep is
vital to physical and mental health and family health. So I certainly
sympathize with those needs. However, there are data that indicate
that white noise during development can be detrimental to the auditory
system. I don't want to frighten any parents if you played white noise
to your kids, this doesn't mean that their auditory system or their
speech patterns are going to be disrupted or that their interpretation
of speech is going to be disrupted forever. But there are data
published in the journal, Science, and Science being one of the three,
APEX Journal, Science, Nature, Cell, the most stringent journals, data
published in the journal, Science, some years ago, actually by a
scientist who I know quite well, his name is Edward Chang, he's a
medical doctor now, he's a neurosurgeon, he's actually the chair of
neurosurgery at UCSF and he runs a laboratory where they study
auditory learning, neuroplasticity, et cetera, he and his mentor at
the time, Mike Merzenich published a paper showing that if young
animals and this was in animal models were exposed to white noise, so
[shushing] the very type of noise that I'm saying as a older person,
and when I say older, I mean, somebody who's in their late teens,
early 20s and older could benefit from listening to that at a low
level in the background for sake of learning, well, they exposed very
young animals to this white noise, it actually disrupted the maps of
the auditory world within the brain. And we haven't talked about these
maps yet, but I want to take a moment and talk about them and explain
this effect and what it might mean for you if you have kids or if you
were exposed to a lot of white noise early on. So auditory information
goes up into our cortex, into these, essentially, the outside portion
of our brain that's responsible for all our higher level cognition and
our planning, our decision-making, et cetera, creativity and up there,
we have what are called tonotopic maps. What's a tonotopic map? Well,
remember the cochlea, how it's coiled and at one end, it responds to
high frequencies and the other end, it responds to low frequencies?
Like a piano, the keys sound different as you extend down and up the
piano keys. And it's organized in a very systematic way. It's not all
intermixed high frequencies and low frequencies. It's organized in a
very systematic way from one end to the other. Your visual system is
in, what's called a retinotopic map. So neighboring points in space
off to my right, like my two fingers off to my right are mapped to
neighboring points in space in my brain. And that space right in front
of me is mapped to a different location in my brain, but it's
systematic, it's regular. It's not random. It's not salt and pepper.
It goes from high to low or from right to center to left. In the
auditory system, we have what are called tonotopic maps, where
frequency, high frequency to low frequency and everything in between
is organized in a very systematic way. Now our experience of life from
the time we're a baby until the time that we die is not systematic. We
don't hear low frequencies at one part of the room or at one part of
the day and high frequencies is another part of the room and other
part of the day, they're all intermixed. But if you remember, the
cochlea separates them out. Just like a prism of light separates out
the different wavelengths of light, the cochlea separates out the
different frequencies. And the developing brain takes those separated
out frequencies and learns this relationship between itself, meaning
the child and the outside world. White noise, essentially contains no
tonotopic information. The frequencies are all intermixed. It's just
noise. Whereas when I speak, my voice has, now I'm getting technical,
but it has what's called a certain envelope, meaning it has some low
frequencies and some slightly higher frequency. Like I might a voice
higher, although I'm not very good at that. My voice starts to crack
and I can make my voice lower, although not as low as Costello's
snore. So it has an envelope, it has a container. White noise has no
container. It's like all the colors of the rainbow spread out
together, which is actually what you get when you get white light
white noise is analogous to white light. So one of the reasons why
hearing a lot of white noise during development for long periods of
time can be detrimental to the development of the auditory system is
that these tonotopic maps don't form normally; at least, they don't in
experimental animals. Now, the reason I'm raising this is that many
people I know, in particular, friends who have small children, they
say, "I want to use a white noise machine while I sleep. But is it
okay for my baby to use a white noise machine?" And I consulted with
various people, scientists about this. And they said, "Well, the baby
is also hearing the parent's voices and is hearing music and it's
hearing the dog bark. So it's not the only thing they're hearing."
However, every single person that I consulted with said, "But there's
neuroplasticity during sleep. That's when the kid is sleeping. And I
don't know that you'd want to expose a child to white noise the entire
night, because it might degrade that tonotopic map." It might not
destroy it. It might not eliminate it, but it could make it a little
less clear, like taking the keys on the piano and taping a few of them
together, right? So you still got the highs and lows in the
appropriate order and everything in between. But when you take the
keys together, you don't get the same fidelity. You don't get the same
precision of the noise that comes out of that piano. So, again, I
don't want to scare anybody, but I would say if you are in a position
to make the choice of either using white noise or something similar,
pink noise is just a variation. It's got a little bit more of a
certain frequency, just like pink light has a little bit more of a
certain wavelength than white light. If you are in a position to make
choices about things, to put in a young, especially very young child's
sleeping environment, white noise might be something to consider
avoiding. Again, I'm not telling you what to do, but it's something to
perhaps consider avoiding. I don't think most pediatricians are going
to be aware of these data, but if you talk to any auditory
physiologists or an audiologist or somebody who studies auditory
development, I'm fairly certain that they would have opinions about
that. Now, whether or not their opinions agree with mine and these
folks that I consulted with or not is a separate matter. I don't know,
cause I don't know them, but it's something that I felt was important
enough to cue you to, especially since I've highlighted, excuse me,
the opposite effect is true in adulthood. Once your auditory system
has formed, once it's established these tonotopic maps, then the
presence of background white noise should not be a problem at all. In
fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all because you're also not
attending to it. The idea is that it's playing at a low enough volume
that you forget it in the background and that it's supporting learning
by bringing your brain into a heightened state of alertness and,
especially, this heightened state of dopamine, dopaminergic activation
of the brain, which will make it easier to learn faster and easier to
learn the information. So now I want to talk about auditory learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=3805"&gt;Remembering Information, The Cocktail Party Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and actually how you can get better at learning information that you
hear, not just information that you see on a page or motor skill
learning. There are a lot of reasons to want to do this. A lot of
classroom teaching, whether or not it's by Zoom or in-person is
auditory in nature. Not everything is necessarily written down for us.
It's also good to get better at listening or so I'm told. So there's a
phenomenon called the cocktail party effect. Now, even if you've never
been to a cocktail party, you've experienced and participated in
what's called the cocktail party effect. The cocktail party effect is
where you are in an environment that's rich with sound, many sound
waves coming from many different sources, many different things, so in
a city, in a classroom, in a car that contains people having various
conversations, you somehow need to be able to attend to specific
components of those sound waves, meaning you need to hear certain
people and not others. The reason it's called the cocktail party
effect is that you and meaning your brain are exquisitely good at
creating a cone of auditory attention, a narrow band of attention with
which you can extract the information you care about and wipe away or
erase all the rest. Now this takes work, it takes attention. One of
the reasons why you might come home from a loud gathering, maybe a
stadium, a sports event or a cocktail party, for that matter, and feel
just exhausted is because if you were listening to conversations there
or trying to listen to those conversations while watching the game and
people moving past you and hearing all this noise, clinking of
glasses, et cetera, it takes attentional effort and the brain uses up
a lot of energy just at rest, but it uses up even more energy when you
are paying strong attention to something, literally caloric energy
burning up things like glucose, et cetera, even if you're ketogenic,
it's burning up energy. So the cocktail party effect has been studied
extensively in the field of neuroscience and we now know at a
mechanistic level, how one accomplishes this feat of attending to
certain sounds, despite the fact that we are being bombarded with all
sorts of other sounds. So there are a couple ways that we do this.
First of all, much as with our visual system, we can expand or
contract our visual field of view, so we can go from panoramic vision,
see the entire scene that we are in by dilating our gaze, talked a lot
about this on this podcast and elsewhere. We can, for instance, keep
our head and eyes stationary or mostly stationary, you don't have to
be rigid about it, and you can expand your field of view so you can
see the walls and ceiling and floor, can see yourself in the
environment, that's panoramic view. It's what you would accomplish
without having to try at all if you went to a horizon, for instance,
or we can contract our field of view, I can bring my focus to a
particular location, what we call a vergence point, directly in front
of me. Now I'm pointing at the camera directly in front of me. We can
do that, we can expand and contract our visual field of view. Well, we
can expand and contract our auditory field of view, so to speak, our
auditory window. You can try this next time you are in an environment
that's rich with noise, meaning lots of different sounds. You can just
tune out all the noise to a background chatter. You try not focus on
any one particular sound and you get the background chatter of noise.
And you'll find that it's actually very relaxing in comparison to
trying to listen to somebody at a cocktail party or shouting back and
forth. Now, if you're very, very interested in that person, or getting
to know them better or what they're telling you, or some combination
of those things, then you'll be very motivated to do it but
nonetheless, it requires energy and effort and attention. How do we do
this? Well, it's actually quite simple or, at least, it's simple, in
essence, although the underlying mechanisms are complex. Here, I have
to credit the laboratory of a guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, up at the
University of Oregon who essentially figured out that we are able to
accomplish this extraction of particular sounds. We can really hear
one person or a small number of people amidst a huge background of
chatter because we pay attention to the onset of words, but also to
the offset of words. Now, the way to visualize this is if the
background noise is just like a bunch of waves of noise, it's
literally just sound waves coming every frequency, low frequency, high
frequency, glasses clinking together. If you've got a game, people are
shouting, people are talking on their phone, there's the crack of the
ball, if somebody actually manages to hit the ball, the announcer, et
cetera, but whatever we were paying attention to, we set up a cone of
auditory attention, a tunnel of auditory attention, where we are
listening although we don't realize it, we are listening for the onset
and the offset of those words. Now this is powerful for a couple of
reasons. First of all, it's a call to arms, so to speak, to disengage
your auditory system when you don't need to focus your attention on
something particular. So if you are somebody, you're coming home from
work, you've had a very long day and you're trying to make out a
particular conversation on background noise, you might consider just
not having that conversation, just letting your auditory landscape be
very broad, almost like panoramic vision. If you're trying to learn
how to extract sound information, it could be notes of music, it could
be scales of music, it could be words spoken by somebody else, maybe
somebody is telling you what you need to say for a particular speech
or the information that you need to learn for a particular topic, and
they're telling it to you, deliberately paying attention both to the
onset and to the offset of those words can be beneficial because it is
exactly the way that the auditory system likes to bring in
information. So one of the more common phenomenon that I think we all
experience is you go to a party or you meet somebody new and you say
hi, I would say, "Hi, I'm Andrew." And they'd say, "Hi, I'm Jeff," for
instance. "Great to meet you." And then a minute later, I can't
remember the guy's name. Now, is it because I don't care what his name
is? No, somehow the presence of other auditory information interfered.
It's not that my mind was necessarily someplace else. It's that the
signal-to-noise as we say wasn't high enough. Somehow the way he said
it or the way it landed on my ears, which is really all that matters,
when it comes down to learning, is such that it just didn't achieve
high enough signal-to-noise. The noise was too high or the signal was
too low or some combination of those. So the next time you ask
somebody's name, remember listen to the onset of what they say and the
offset. So it would be paying attention to the j in Jeff and it would
be paying attention to that in f in F, in Jeff, excuse me. And chances
are, you'll be able to remember that name. Now, I don't know if people
who are super learners of names do this naturally or not. I don't have
access to their brains. I don't think they're going to give me access
to their brains either. But it's a very interesting way to take the
natural biology of auditory attention and learning and apply it to
scenarios where you're trying to remember either people's names or
specific information. Now, I do acknowledge that trying to learn every
word in a sentence by paying attention to its onset and offset could
actually be disruptive to the learning process. So this would be more
for specific attention, like you're asking directions in a city and
somebody says, okay, you say you're lost and they say, okay, you're
going to go two blocks down, you're going to turn left. And then
you're going to see a landmark on your right. And then you're going to
go in the third door on your left. That's a lot of information, at
least, for me. So the way you would want to listen to that is you're
going to go down the road. See, I already forgot. You're going to go
left and you're just going to program and instead of just hearing the
word left, you're going to think the L at the front of left and the T.
You're going to left, okay. So you're coding in specific words. And
what this does is this hijacks these naturally-occurring attention
mechanisms that the auditory system likes to use. So a little bit of
data that for auditory encoding, this kind of thing can be beneficial.
There are a lot of data that attention for auditory coding is
beneficial. There are a little bit of data showing that deliberately
encoding auditory information this way, meaning trying to learn
auditory information this way can be beneficial or can accelerate
learning. And some of these features of what I'm describing here, map
onto some of the work that of Mike Merzenich and others that have been
designed to try and overcome things like stutter and to treat various
forms of auditory learning disorders. But more importantly, and
perhaps more powerful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=4375"&gt;How to Learn Information You Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the work of Mike Merzenich that was done with his then graduate
student, Gregg Recanzone that showed that, using the attentional
system, we can actually learn much faster and we can actually activate
neuroplasticity in the adult brain, something that's very challenging
to do. And that the auditory system is one of the main ways in which
we can access neuroplasticity more broadly. So I just want to take a
couple of minutes and describe the work of Recanzone and Merzenich,
because it's absolutely fantastic and fascinating. What they did is
they had subjects try to learn auditory information, except that they
told them to pay attention to particular frequencies. So now you know
what frequencies are so, essentially, high-pitched sounds or low-
pitched sounds. What they found was just passively listening to a
bunch of stuff does not allow the brain to change and for that stuff
to be remembered at all. That's not a surprise. We've all experienced
the phenomenon of having someone talk and we see their mouth moving
and we're like, yeah, this is really important, this is really
important. We're listening. We're trying to listen. And then they walk
away and we think I didn't get any of that. And you wonder whether or
not it was them, maybe this is happening to you right now. You wonder
whether or not it was you, you wonder whether or not you have trouble
with learning or you have attention deficit. It could be any number of
different things. But what Recanzone and Merzenich discovered was that
if you instruct subjects to listen for particular cues within speech,
or within sounds, that not only can you learn those things more
quickly, but that you can remap these tonotopic maps in the cortex
that I referred to earlier. You actually get changes in the neural
architecture, the neural circuitry in the brain, and this can occur
not only very rapidly, but they can occur in the adult brain, which
prior to their work was not thought to be amenable to change. It was
long thought that neuroplasticity could only occur in the developing
brain, but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich in the auditory system
actually was some of the first that really opened up everybody's eyes
and ears to the idea that the brain can change in adulthood. So here's
how this sort of process would work and how you might apply it. If you
are trying to learn music, or you're trying to learn information that
you're going to then recite, you can decide to highlight certain words
or certain frequencies of sound or certain scales or certain keys on
the piano, and to only focus on those for certain learning bouts. So
I'll give an example that's real time for me, meaning it's happening
right now. I know generally what I want to say when I arrive here, I
even know specifically certain things that I want to make sure get
across to you, but I don't think about every single word that I'm
going to say and the precise order in which I'm going to say those
things. That would be actually very disruptive because it wouldn't
match my normal patterns of speech and you'd probably think I was
sounding rather robotic if I were to do that. So one way that we can
remember information is as we write out, for instance, something that
we want to say, we can highlight particular words, we can underline
those. If we're listening to somebody and they're telling us
information, we can decide just to highlight particular words that
they said to us and write those down. Now, of course, we're listening
to all the information, but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich and
the work of others in addition to his former student or former post-
doc, I don't know which, Michael Kilgard who's now got his own lab
down in Texas or others have shown that the cuing of attention to
particular features of speech, particular components of speech, the
way in which it increases our level of attention overall allows us to
capture more of the information overall. And so I don't want this to
be abstract at all. What this means is when you're listening, you
don't have to listen to every word. You're already listening to every
word. All the information is coming in through your ears. What you're
trying to extract is particular things or themes within the content.
So maybe you decide if you're listening to me that you're only going
to listen to the word tools, or you're only going to listen to when my
voice goes above background, you get to decide what you decide to
listen to or not. And what you decide to focus on isn't necessarily as
important as the fact that you're focusing. So I hope that's clear.
The auditory system does this all the time with the cocktail party
effect. What I'm talking about is exporting certain elements of the
mechanisms of the cocktail party effect, paying attention to the onset
and offset of words or particular notes within music or particular
scales, or you can make it even broader and particular motifs of music
or particular sentences of words or particular phrases. And in doing
that, you extract more of the information overall, even though you're
not paying attention to all the information at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=4690"&gt;Doppler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'd like to talk about a phenomenon that you've all experienced
before, which is called Doppler. So the Doppler effect is the way that
we experience sound when the thing that's making that sound is moving.
The simplest way to explain this is to translate the sound into the
visual world once again. So if you've ever seen a duck or a goose
sitting in a pond or a lake and it's bobbing up and down, what you'll
notice is that the ripples of water that extend out from that duck or
goose are fairly regularly spaced in all directions. And that's
because that duck or goose is stationary. It's moving up and down, but
it's not moving forward or backward or to the side. Now, if that duck
or goose were to swim forward by paddling its little webbed feet under
the surface, you would immediately notice that the ripples of water
that are close to and in front of that duck or goose would be closer
together than the ones that trailed it, that were behind. And that is
essentially what happens with sound as well. With the Doppler effect,
we experience sounds that are closer to us at higher frequency, the
ripples are closer together, and sounds that are further away at lower
frequency, especially when they're moving past us. So if you've ever,
for instance, heard a siren in the distance, [humming] that's
essentially my rendition of a siren, I don't know what ambulance or
police or what, passing you on a street, that is the Doppler effect.
The Doppler effect is one of the main ways that we make out the
direction that things are arriving from and their speeds and
trajectories. And we get very good, from a very young age, at
discerning what direction things are arriving from and the direction
that they are going to pass us in. And the Doppler effect has probably
saved your life many, many times. In this way, you just don't realize
it because you'll step off the curb or you're driving your car and you
pull to the side so that the ambulance or firetruck can go by because
you heard that siren off in the distance, and then you pull away from
the curb and you get back on the road in part, because you don't see
it any longer, but also you don't hear any other sirens in the
distance. Now, some animals such as bats are exquisitely good at
navigating their environments according to sound. Now, we've all heard
that bats don't see. That's actually not true. They actually have
vision, but they just rely more heavily on their auditory system. And
the way that bats navigate in the dark and the way that bats navigate
using sound is through Doppler. Now, they don't simply listen to
whether or not things are coming at them or moving away from them and
pay attention to the Doppler like the siren example I gave for you.
What they do is they generate their own sounds. So a bat, as it flies
around is sending out clicks, [Andrew clicks tongue] I think that's my
best bat sound or maybe it's [Andrew clicks tongue] and they're
clicking, they're actually propelling sound out at a particular
frequency that they know. Now, whether or not they're conscious of it,
I don't know. I've never asked them. And if I did ask them, I don't
think they could answer. And if they could answer, they couldn't
answer in a language that I could understand. But the bat is
essentially flying around, sending out sound waves, pinging its
environment with sound waves of a particular frequency and then
depending on the frequency of sound waves that come back, they know if
they're getting closer to an object or further away from it. So if
they send out sounds at a frequency of, this was much slower than it
would actually occur, but let's say one every half second, [whining]
and it's coming back even faster [roars] then they know they're
getting closer because of the Doppler effect. And if it comes back
more slowly, they know that there's nothing in front of them. So the
bat is essentially navigating its world by creating these auras of
sound that bounce back on to them from the various objects, trees, et
cetera, buildings and people, it's kind of eerie to think about. But
yes, they see you, they experience you with their sound, they sense
you and they're using Doppler to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=4963"&gt;Tinnitus: What Has Been Found To Help?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'd like to talk about ringing in the ears. This is something that
I get asked about a lot. And speaking of signal-to-noise, I don't know
if I get asked about it a lot, because many people suffer from ringing
in their ears, or because the people who suffer from ringing in their
ears suffer so much that they are more prone to ask. So it could be a
sampling bias, I don't know, but I've been asked enough times and some
of the experiences of discomfort that people have expressed about
having this ringing of the ears really motivated me to go deep into
this literature. So the ringing of the ears that one experiences is
called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus, but tinnitus. And tinnitus can vary
in intensity and it can vary according to stress levels, it can vary
across the lifespan or even time of day. So it's very subject to
background effects and contextual effects. So I think we all know that
we should do our best to maximize healthy sleep. We did a number of
episodes on that. Essentially, the first four episodes of the Huberman
Lab Podcast were all about sleep and how to get better sleep. We all
know that we should try and limit our stress. And we had an episode
about stress and ways to mitigate stress as well. However, there are
people, it seems, that are suffering from tinnitus, for which stress
or lack of sleep just can't explain the presence of the tinnitus.
Tinnitus can be caused by disruption to these hair cells that we
talked about earlier or damage to the hair cells. So that's another
reason why, even if you have good hearing now that you want to protect
that hearing and really avoid putting yourself into these two-hit
environments, environments where there's a lot of background noise,
and then you add another really loud auditory stimulus. This also can
happen at different times, I should mention. If you go to a concert or
you listen to loud music with your headphones and then you go to a
concert, or you go into a very loud work environment, the hair cells
can still be vulnerable. And once those hair cells are knocked out,
currently, we don't have the technology to put them back. Although
many groups, including some excellent groups at Stanford and
elsewhere, too, of course, are working on ways to replenish those hair
cells and restore hearing. There are treatments for tinnitus that
involve taking certain substances. There are medications for tinnitus.
In the non-prescription landscape, which is typically what we discuss
on this podcast, when we discuss taking anything, there are,
essentially, four compounds for which there are quality peer-reviewed
data, where there does not appear to be any overt commercial bias,
meaning that nothing's reported in the papers as funding from a
particular company and those are melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc and
magnesium. Now I've talked about melatonin before. I'm personally not
a fan of melatonin as a sleep aid, but there are four studies, first
one entitled: The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus, tinnitus, excuse
me, and Sleep. Second one, Treatment of Central and Sensory Neural
Tinnitus with orally-administered melatonin. And then the title goes
on much longer, but it's a randomized study. I'm not going to read out
all these. Melatonin: Can it Stop The ringing? which is an interesting
article, double-blinded study, and The Effects of Melatonin on
Tinnitus. Each one of these studies has anywhere from 30 to more than
100 subjects, in one case 102 subjects; both genders as they list them
out, typically, it's listed as sex, not gender in studies so it should
say both sexes, but nonetheless; an age range anywhere from 30 years
old, all the way up to 65 plus. I didn't see any studies of people
younger than 30. All three focused on melatonin, not surprisingly,
because of the titles, looking at a range of dosages anywhere from
three milligrams per day, which is sort of typical of many supplements
for melatonin, still much higher than one would manufacture
endogenously through your own pineal gland, but three milligrams in
these studies for a duration of anywhere from 30 days to much longer
in some cases, six months. And all four of these studies found modest
yet still statistically significant effects of taking melatonin by
mouth, so it's orally-administered melatonin in reducing the severity
of tinnitus. So that's compelling, at least to me. It doesn't sound
like a cure. And, of course, as always, I'm not a physician, I'm a
scientist, so I don't prescribe anything. I only profess things, I
report to you the science. You have to decide if melatonin is right
for you if you have tinnitus. And certainly, I say that both to
protect myself, but also protect you. You're responsible for your
health and wellbeing. And I'm not telling anyone to run out and start
taking melatonin for tinnitus, but it does seem that it can have some
effects in reducing its symptoms. Ginkgo Boaboa is an interesting
compound. It's been prescribed for or recommended for many, many
things, but there are a few studies, again, double-blinded studies
lasting one to six months, one that has have an impressive number of
subjects, 978 subjects ranging from age 18 all the way up to 65 so on
and so forth that show not huge effects of Ginkgo, but as they quote,
limited evidence suggests that if tinnitus is a side effect of
something else, in particular, cognitive decline, so age-related
tinnitus might be helped by Ginkgo Boaboa. I won't go through all the
details of the zinc studies, but it seems that zinc supplementation at
higher levels than are typical of most people's intakes of 50
milligrams per day, do appear to be able to reduce subjective symptoms
of tinnitus in most of the people that took the supplemented zinc.
There aren't a lot of studies on that. So I could only find one
double-blinded study. It lasted anywhere from one to six months, 41
subjects, both genders listed out again here, 45 to 64, and they saw a
decrease in the severity of tinnitus symptoms with 50 milligrams of
elemental zinc supplementation. And then last but not least is the
magnesium study. Again, only a single study. It's a Phase II study
looking at a fairly limited number of subjects, so only 19 subjects
taking 532 milligrams of elemental magnesium. For those of you that
take magnesium, there's magnesium and elemental magnesium, and it's
always translated on the bottle, but it was associated with a
lessening of symptoms related to tinnitus. So for you tinnitus
sufferers out there, you may already be aware of this, you may already
be taking these things and had no positive effects, meaning they
didn't help, maybe not. I hope that you'll, at least, consider these,
talk to your doctor about them. I do realize that tinnitus is
extremely disruptive. I can't say I empathize because I don't, from a
place of experience, that is, because I don't have tinnitus, but for
those of you that don't include myself, you can imagine that hearing
sounds of things that aren't there and the ringing in one's ears can
be very disruptive and I think would be very disruptive and explains
why people with tinnitus reach out so often with questions about how
to alleviate that. And I hope this information was useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=5440"&gt;Aging: How Big Are Your Ears?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to now talk about balance and our sense of balance, which is
controlled by, believe it or not, our ears and things in our ears, as
well as by our brain and elements of our spinal cord. But before I do
that, I want to ask you another question or I would rather, I'd like
to ask you to ask yourself a question and answer it, which is how big
are your ears. It turns out that the ears grow our entire life. In the
early stage of our life, they grow more slowly. And then as we age,
they grow more quickly. You may have noticed if you have family
members who are well into their 70s and 80s, and if you're fortunate,
into their 90s and maybe even 100s, is that the ears of some of these
individuals get very, very big, relative to their previous ear sizes.
So it turns out that biological age can actually be measured according
to ear size. Now you have to take a few measurements but there's,
believe it or not, there is a formula in the scientific literature, if
you know your ear circumference, so the distance around your ear,
ears, plural, presumably you have two, most people do, in millimeters,
so you're going to take the circumference of your ears in millimeters.
How would you do this? How would you do this? Maybe you take a string
and you put it around your ear, and then you measure the string.
That's probably going to be easier than marching around your ear or
somebody else's ear with a ruler and measuring in millimeters. So
what's your ear circumference, on the outside, don't go in on the
divot or anything. You're just going around as if you're going to
trace the closest fitting oval, assuming your ears are oval, closest
fitting oval that matches your ear circumference. Take that number in
millimeters, subtract from it... Oh, excuse me, I should do this
correctly. Do that for both ears, add them together, add those numbers
together, divide by two, get the average for your two ears, get your
average ear circumference, of course, your two ears. Then take that
number in millimeters, subtract 88.1 and then whatever value that is,
multiply it times 1.96 and that will tell you your biological age. Now
why in the world would this be accurate? As we age, there are changes
in number of different biological pathways. One of those pathways is
the pathways related to collagen synthesis. So not only are our ears
growing, but our noses are growing too, and my nose seems to be
growing a lot. But then again, I did sports where I would get my nose
broken, something I don't recommend. As I always point out, you don't
get a nose like mine doing yoga, but nonetheless, my nose is still
growing and my ears are still growing. And I suspect as I get older,
if I have the good fortune of living into my 80s and 90s, my ears are
going to continue to grow. A comparison between chronological age and
biological age is something that's a really deep interest these days
in the work of David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School and others. So
called Horvath clocks that people have developed have tapped into how
the epigenome and the genome can give us some insight into our
biological age and how that compares to our chronological age. Most of
us know our chronological age, because we know when we were born and
we know where we are relative to that now. But you can start to make a
little chart, if you like, about your rates of ear growth. Your rates
of ear growth actually correlate pretty well with your rates of
biological progression through this thing that we call life. So it's
not something that we think about too often, but just like our DNA and
our epigenome, and some other markers of metabolic health and hormone
health relate to our age, so does our collagen synthesis. And one of
the places that shows up the most is in these two little goodies on
the sides of our heads, which are our ears. So even though it's a
little bit of a bizarre metric, it makes perfect sense in the
biological context. So let's talk about balance and how to get better
at balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=5700"&gt;Balance: Semi-Circular Canals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why we're talking about balance and how to get better at
balancing in the episode about hearing is that all the goodies that
are going to allow you to do that are in your ears. They're also in
your brain, but they're mostly in your ears. So as you recall from the
beginning of this episode, you have two cochlea, cochleas, that are
one on each side of your head. And that's a little spiral snail-shaped
thing that converts sound waves into electrical signals that the rest
of your brain can understand. Right next to those, you have what are
called semicircular canals. The semicircular canals can be best
visualized as thinking about three hula hoops with marbles in them. So
imagine that you have a hula hoop and it's not filled with marbles all
the way around, it's just got some marbles down there at the base. So
if you were to move that hula hoop around, the marbles would move
around, [shushing]. You've got three of those and each one of those
hula hoops has these marbles that can move around. One of those hula
hoops is positioned vertically with respect to gravity. So it's
basically parallel to your nose. It sits like this, if you're watching
on a video, but basically it's upright. Another one of those hula
hoops is basically at a 90-degree angle to your nose. It's basically
parallel to the floor if you're standing up right now, if you're
seated. And the other one, it's kind of tilted about 45 degrees in
between those. Now why is the system there? Well, those marbles within
each one of those hula hoops can move around, but they'll only move
around if your head moves in a particular way, and there are three
planes or three ways that your head can move. Your head can move up
and down like I'm nodding right now. So that's called pitch, it's
pitching forward or pitching back. So it's a nod, up and down, or I
can shake my head no, side to side. That's called a yaw. You pilots
will be very familiar with this, yaw. Not yawn, yaw. And then there's
roll, tilting the head from side to side, the way that a cute puppy
might look at you from side to side or that if somebody doesn't really
understand or believe what you're saying, they might tilt their head,
very common phenomenon. I mean, nobody does that to me, but they do
that to each other. So pitch, yaw and roll are the movements of the
head in each of the three major planes of motion, as we say. And each
one of those causes those marbles to move in one or two of the various
hula hoops. So if I move my head up and down when I nod, one of those
hula hoops, literally, right now, the marbles are moving back and
forth. They aren't actually marbles by the way, these are little, kind
of like little stones, basically, little calcium-like deposits and
when they roll back and forth, they deflect little hairs, little hair
cells that aren't like the hair cells that we use for measuring sound
waves. They're not too different, but they are different from them,
not like the hairs on our heads, but they're basically rolling past
these little hair cells and causing them to deflect and when they
deflect downward, the neurons, because hair cells are neurons, send
information up to the brain. So if I move my head like this, there's a
physical movement of these little stones in this hula hoop as I'm
referring to it, but they deflect these hairs, send those hairs, which
are neurons, those hair cells, send information off to the brain. If I
move my head from side to side, different little stones move. If I
roll my head, different stones move. This is an exquisite system that
exists in all animals that have a jaw. So any fish that has a jaw has
this system, a puppy has the system, any animal that has a jaw has
this so-called balance system, which we call the vestibular system.
One of the more important things to know about the vestibular, the
balance system is that it works together with the visual system. Let's
say I hear something off to my left and I swing my head over to the
left to see what it is. There are two sources of information about
where my head is relative to my body and I need to know that. First of
all, when I quickly move my head to the side, those little stones, as
I'm referring to them, I realize they're not actually stones, but as
I'm referring to them, they quickly, whoom, activate those hair cells
in that one semicircular canal, and send a signal off to my brain that
my head just moved to the side like this, not that it went like this
and pitched back or not that it tilted, but it just moved to the side.
But also visual information slid past my field of view. I didn't have
to think about it, but just slid past my field of view. And when those
two signals combine, my eyes then lock to a particular location. Now,
if this is at all complicated, you can actually uncouple these things.
It's very easy to do. You can do this right now. In fact, I'd like you
to do this experiment if you're not already doing something else that
requires your attention. And certainly, don't do this if you're
driving. You're going to sit down and you're going to move your head
to the left very slowly with your eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=6035"&gt;A Vestibular Experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you're going to move it very, very slowly. The whole thing should
take about five, six, maybe even 10 seconds to complete. Okay, I just
did it. Now, I'm going to do it very quickly. I'd like you to do it
very quickly as well. Now do it slowly again. What you probably
noticed is that it's very uncomfortable to do it slowly, but you can
do it very quickly without much discomfort at all. You just move your
head to the side. The reason is when you move your head, very slowly,
those little stones at the base of that hula hoop, they don't get
enough momentum to move. So you're actually not generating this signal
to the brain that your head is moving. And what you'll notice is that
your eyes have to go, boom, boom, boom, jumping over step-by-step.
Whereas if you move your head really quickly, the signal gets off to
your brain and your eyes just go boom, right to the location you want
to look at. So moving your body slowly is actually very disruptive to
the vestibular system. And it's very disruptive to your visual system.
Now, if you've ever had the misfortune of being on a boat and you're
going through big oscillations on the boat, for those of you seasick,
folks that get seasick, this can actually make certain people seasick
just to hear about it, those big oscillations going up and down and up
and down. Those are very disruptive. We'll talk about nausea in a
minute and how to offset that kind of nausea. I get pretty seasick,
but there are ways that you can deal with this but this is incredible
because what it means is a purely physical system of these little
stones rolling around in there and directing where your eyes should
go. So you can do this also just by looking up. So let's just say,
you're sitting in a chair, you're going to look up towards the ceiling
and your eyes will just go there. You're doing this eyes open and you
look down. Now try doing it right really, really slowly. Some people
even get motion sick doing this, which if you do, then just stop.
Okay, so you can do this also to the side, although it works best if
you're moving your head from side to side and we're nodding up and
down. So what we're doing here is we're uncoupling these two
mechanisms, we're pulling them apart, the visual part and the
vestibular part, just to illustrate to you that, normally, these
mechanisms in your inner ear tell your eyes where to go, but as well,
your eyes tell your balance system, your vestibular system, how to
function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=6195"&gt;Improve Your Sense of Balance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'd like you to do a different experiment. I'm not going to do it
right now, but basically stand up. If you get the opportunity, you can
do this safely, wherever you are, you're going to stand up and you're
going to look forward about 10, 12 feet. Pick a point on a wall or you
can, anywhere that you like, if you're out in public, just do it
anyway. Just tell them you're listening to Huberman Lab Podcasts, and
someone's telling you to do it. Anyway, if you don't want to do it,
don't do it. But, basically, do it. Stand on one leg and lift up the
other leg. You can bend your knee, if you like and just look off into
the distance about 10, 12 feet. If you can do that, if you can stand
on one leg, now close your eyes, chances are you're going to suddenly
feel what scientists call postural sway. You're going to start swaying
around a lot. It is very hard to balance with your eyes closed. And if
you think about that, it's like, why is that? That's crazy. Why would
it be that it's hard to balance with your eyes closed? Well,
information about the visual world also feeds back onto this
vestibular system. So the vestibular system informs your vision and
tells you where to move your eyes and your eyes and their positioning
tell your balance system, your vestibular system how it should
function. So there's a really cool way that you can learn to optimize
balance. You're not going to try and do this by learning to balance
with your eyes closed. What you can do is you can raise one leg and
you can look at a short distance, maybe off to just the distance that
your thumb would be if you were to reach your arm out in front of you.
Although you don't necessarily have to put your thumb in front of you.
So maybe just about two feet in front of you. Then while still
balancing, you're going to step your vision out a further distance,
and then a further distance and as far as you can possibly see in the
environment that you're in. And then you're going to march it back to
you. Now, what the literature shows is that this kind of balance
training where you incorporate the visual system and extending out,
and then marching back in the point at which you direct your visual
focus, sends robust information about the relationship between your
visual world and your balance system. And, of course, the balance
system includes not just these hula hoops, these semicircular canals,
but they communicate with the cerebellum, the so-called mini-brain, it
actually means mini-brain in the back of your brain, combines that
with visual information and your map of the body surface. That pattern
of training is very beneficial for enhancing your ability to balance
because the ability to balance is, in part, the activation of
particular postural muscles, but just as much, perhaps even moreso,
it's about being able to adjust those postural muscles, excuse me,
it's about the ability to adjust those postural muscles as you
experience changes in your visual world. And one of the most robust
ways that you can engage changes in your visual world is through your
own movement. And so most people are not trying to balance in place,
right? They're not just trying to stand there like a statue on one
leg. Most of what we think about when we think about balance is for
sake of sport or dynamic balance of being able to break ourselves,
when we're lunging in one particular direction to stop ourselves, that
is, and then to move in another direction or for skateboarding or
surfing or cycling or any number of different things, gymnastics. So
the visual system is the primary input by which you develop balance,
but you can't do it just with the visual system. So what I'm
recommending is if you're interested in cultivating a sense of
balance, understand the relationship between the semicircular canals,
understand that they are both driving eye movements and they are
driven by eye movements. It's a reciprocal relationship. And then even
just two or three minutes a day, or every once in a while, even three
times a week, maybe five minutes, maybe 10 minutes, you pick, but if
you want to enhance balance, you have to combine changes in your
visual environment with a static posture, standing on one leg and
shifting your visual environment or static visual view, looking at one
thing and changing your body posture. So those two things, we now know
from the scientific literature, combine in order to give an enhanced
sense of balance. And there's a really nice paper that was published
in 2015 called Effects of Balance Training on Balance Performance.
This was in healthy adults. It's a systematic review and a meta
analysis. A meta analysis is when you combine a lot of literature from
a lot of different papers and extract the really robust and the less
robust statistical effects. So it's a really nice paper as well. There
are some papers out there, for instance, comparison of static balance
and the role of vision in the elite athletes. This is essentially the
paper that I've extracted most of the information that I just gave you
from. And that paper, and there are some others as well, but basically
I distilled them down into their core components. The core components
are move your vision around while staying static, still but in a
balanced position like standing on one leg, could be something more
complicated if you're somebody who can do more complicated movements.
Unilateral movement seemed to be important, so standing on one leg as
opposed to both, or trying to generate some tilt is another way to go
about it or imbalance, meaning one limb asymmetrically being activated
compared to the other limb. And then the other way to encourage or to
cultivate and build up this vestibular system and your sense of
balance actually involves movement itself, acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=6535"&gt;Accelerating Balance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's what we're going to talk about now. So up until now, I've
been talking about balance only in the static sense, like standing on
one leg for instance, but that's a very artificial situation. Even
though you can train balance that way, most people who want to enhance
their sense of balance for sport or dance, or some other endeavor,
want to engage balance in a dynamic way, meaning moving through lots
of different planes of movement, maybe even sometimes while squatting
down low or jumping and landing or making trajectories that are
different angles. For that, we need to consider that the vestibular
system also cares about acceleration. So it cares about head position,
it cares about eye position and where the eyes are and where you're
looking, but it also cares about what direction you're moving and how
fast. And one of the best things that you can do to enhance your sense
of balance is to start to bring together your visual system, the
semicircular canals of the inner ear and what we call linear
acceleration. So if I move forward in space rigidly upright, it's a
vastly different situation than if I'm leaning to the side. One of the
best ways to cultivate a better sense of balance, literally, within
the sense organs and the neurons and the biology of the brain is to
get into modes where we are accelerating forward, typically, it's
forward while also tilted with respect to gravity. Now this would be
the carve on a skateboard or on a surf board or a snowboard. This
would be the taking a corner on a bike while being able to lean,
safely, of course, lean into the turn so that your head is actually
tilted with respect to the earth. So anytime that we are rigidly
upright, we aren't really exercising the vestibular system imbalance.
And this is why you see people in the gym on these, one of those
bouncy balls, Bocce balls are the one that the guys roll in the park.
Bouncy balls, where they're balancing back and forth, that will work
the small stabilizing muscles. But what I'm talking about is getting
into modes where you actually tilt the body and the head with respect
to earth. What I mean is with respect to Earth's gravitational pull.
Now the cerebellum is a very interesting structure because not only is
it involved in balance, but it's also involved in skill-learning and
in generating timing of movements. It's a fascinating structure
deserving of an entire episode or several episodes all on its own, but
some of the outputs of the cerebellum, meaning the neurons in the
cerebellum get inputs, but they also send information out. The outputs
of the cerebellum are strongly linked to areas of the brain that
release neuromodulators that make us feel really good, in particular,
serotonin and dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=6715"&gt;Self-Generated Forward Motion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is an early emerging sub-field within neuroscience, but a lot
of what are called the non-motor outputs of the cerebellum have a
profound influence, not just on our ability to learn how to balance
better, but also how we feel overall. So for you exercisers out there,
I do hope people are getting regular healthy amounts of exercise.
We've talked about what that means in previous episodes, so at least
150 minutes a week of endurance work, some strength training, a
minimum five sets per body part to maintain musculature even if you
don't want to grow muscles, you want to do that in order to maintain
healthy, strengthened bones, et cetera. If you're doing that but
you're only doing things like curls in the gym, squats in the gym,
riding the Peloton, or even if you're outside running, and you're
getting forward acceleration, but you're never actually getting
tilted, you're never actually getting tilted with respect to Earth's
gravitational pull, you're not really exercising and getting the most
out of your nervous system. Activation of the cerebellum in this way
of being tilted or the head being tilted and the body being tilted
while in acceleration, typically forward acceleration, but sometimes
side to side has a profound and positive effect on our sense of mood
and wellbeing. And as I talked about in previous episode, it can also
enhance our ability to learn information in the period after
generating those tilts. And the acceleration. And that's because the
cerebellum has these outputs to these areas of the brain that release
these neuromodulators, like serotonin and dopamine. And they make us
feel really good. I think this is one of the reasons why, growing up,
I had some friends, some of whom might've been the world heavyweight
champions of laziness for essentially everything, except they would
wake up at 4:30 in the morning to go surf. They would drive, they
would get up so early to go surf. It's not just surfers and some
surfers, by the way, I should point out are not lazy humans. They do a
lot of other things. But I knew people that couldn't be motivated to
do anything, but they were highly driven to get into these experiences
of forward acceleration while tilted with respect to gravity,
likewise, with snowboarding or skiing or cycling. Those modes of
exercise seem to have an outsized effect both on our wellbeing and our
ability to translate the vestibular balance that we achieve in those
endeavors to our ability to balance while doing other things, and I
don't mean psychological balance necessarily. I mean physical balance.
So for those of you that don't think of yourselves as very coordinated
or with very good balance, getting into these modes of acceleration
forward movement or lateral movement while getting tilted, even if you
have to do it slowly, could be beneficial, I do believe, and the
scientific literature points to the fact that it will be beneficial
for cultivating better sense of physical balance. It can really build
up the circuits of this vestibular system. And then, of course, the
feel-good components of acceleration while tilted or while getting the
head into different orientations relative to gravity, well, that's the
explanation for roller-coasters. Some people hate roller-coasters.
They make them feel nauseous. Many people love roller-coasters and one
of the reasons they love roller-coasters is because of the way that
when you get the body, even if you're not generating the movement, you
get the body into forward acceleration and you're going upside down
and tilted to the side as the tracks go from side to side and tilt, et
cetera, you're getting activation of these deeper brain nuclei that
trigger the release of neuromodulators that just make us feel really,
really good. In fact, some people get a long arc, a long duration buzz
from having gone through those experiences. Some people who hate
roller-coasters are probably getting nauseous, just hearing about
that. So I encourage people to get into modes of acceleration while
tilted every once in a while, provided you can do it safely. It's an
immensely powerful way to build up your skills in the realm of
balance. And it's also, for most people, very, very pleasing. It feels
really good because of the chemical relationship between forward
acceleration and head tilt and body tilt. Now, speaking of feeling
nauseous, some people suffer from vertigo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=6985"&gt;Dizzy versus Light-Headed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people feel dizzy, some people get lightheaded. An important
question to ask yourself, always, if you're feeling quote-unquote
dizzy or lightheaded, is are you dizzy or are you lightheaded? Now,
we're not going to diagnose anything here because there's just no way
we can do that. This is essentially me shouting into a tunnel. So we
don't know what's going on with each and every one of you but if ever
you feel that your world is spinning, but that you can focus on your
thumb, for instance, but the rest of the world is spinning and your
thumb is stationary, that's called being dizzy. Now, if you feel like
you're falling or that you feel like you need to get down onto the
ground because you feel light-headed, that's being light-headed. And,
oftentimes, with language we don't distinguish between being dizzy and
being lightheaded. Now there are a lot of ways that dizziness and
lightheadedness can occur. And I don't even want to begin to guess at
the number of different things and ways that it could happen for those
of you that suffer from it because it could be any number of them.
But, oftentimes, if people are lightheaded, yes, it could be low blood
sugar. It could also be that you're dehydrated. It could also be that
you are low in electrolytes. We talked about this in a previous
episode, but we will talk about it more in a future episode. Many
people have too little sodium in their system, salt, and that's why
they feel lightheaded. I have family members who, for years, thought
they had disrupted blood sugar. They would get shaky, jittery,
lightheaded, feel like they were nauseous, et cetera. And simply the
addition of little sea salt to their water remedied the problem
entirely. I don't think it's going to remedy every issue of
lightheadedness out there by any stretch, but just the addition of
salt, in this particular case, helped the person. And they are not
alone. Many people who think that they have low blood sugar, actually
are lightheaded because of low electrolytes and because of the way
that salt carries water into the system and creates changes in blood
volume, et cetera. Low sodium can often be a source of lightheadedness
as can low blood sugar and, of course, other things as well. Now for
dizziness or seasickness, we were all taught that you need to pick a
point on the horizon and focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=7118"&gt;Motion Sickness Solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But actually, that's not correct. It is true that if you are down in
the cabin of a boat or you're on the lower deck and all you can see
are things up close to you, that getting sloshed around, like so or
the boat going up and down, like so, I think I'm getting a little
seasick, even as I do this and I describe it, focusing on things close
to you can be problematic. And in that case, the advice to go up on
deck and get fresh air and to look off into the horizon, that part is
correct. But focusing your eyes on a particular location on the
horizon is effectively like trying to move very slowly as I had you do
before, where you're trying to move your head very slowly while
fixating on one location. Your eyes and your balance system were
designed to move together. So really, what you want to do is allow
your visual system to track with your vestibular system. This is why
sitting in the back of an Uber or a taxi and being on your phone can
make you suddenly feel very nauseous. Sometimes the cabs, particularly
in New York City, they have a lot of occluders, they have a lot of
stuff blocking your field of view. There's usually a little portal
where you can see out to the front of the front windshield, but
there's all this stuff now, televisions in the back seat and you're
watching that television and the cab is moving. You're in linear
acceleration, and sometimes you're taking corners, you're braking so
then your vestibular system has to adjust to that. If you're looking
at your phone or a book, or even if you're talking to somebody,
actually, I'm starting to feel a little nauseous just talking about
it. I promise I'm not going to finish this episode by vomiting at the
end, at least not here, but what can happen is that you're uncoupling
the visual information from your motion, from your vestibular
information. You want those to be coupled. This is why a lot of people
have to drive, they can't be in the passenger seat. Because when you
drive, you also get what's called proprioceptive feedback. Your body
is sending signals also to the vestibular system about where you are
in space. When you're the passenger, you're just getting jolted around
as the person is driving. And if you're looking at your phone, it's
even worse. And if you're looking at the occluder between you and the
two front seats, that's even worse. So this is why staring out the
front windshield is great but you don't want to fixate. So, hopefully,
I spared a few people and, hopefully, a few cab drivers of having
people get sick in their cars or Ubers. Let your visual system and
your vestibular system work together. If appropriate, get into linear
acceleration, and you'll improve your sense of balance. Once again,
we've covered a tremendous amount of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRyzYB9JSY&amp;amp;t=7283"&gt;Synthesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you know how you hear, how you make sense of the sounds in your
environment, how those come into your ears and how your brain
processes them. In addition, we talked about things like low level
white noise and even binaural beats, which can be used to enhance
certain brain states, certain rhythms within the brain, and even
dopamine release in ways that allow you to learn better. And we talked
about the balance system and this incredible relationship between your
vestibular apparatus, meaning the portions of your inner ear that are
responsible for balance and your visual system and gravity. And you
can use those to enhance your learning as well, as well as just to
enhance your sense of balance. If you're learning from this podcast,

&lt;p&gt;[gentle upbeat music] - [Andrew] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
where we discuss science, and science-based tools for everyday life.
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and
ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the
pleasure of introducing the first guest of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
My guest is Dr. Karl Deisseroth. Dr. Karl Deisseroth is a medical
doctor, he's a psychiatrist and a research scientist at Stanford
School of Medicine. In his clinical practice, he sees patients dealing
with a range of nervous system disorders, including obsessive
compulsive disorder, autism, attention deficit disorders,
schizophrenia, mania, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. His
laboratory develops and explores tools with which to understand how
the nervous system works in the healthy situation, as well as in
disorders of the mind. Dr. Deisseroth's laboratory has pioneered the
development and use of what are called channelopsins, proteins that
come from algae, which can now be introduced to the nervous systems of
animals and humans, in order to precisely control the activity of
neurons in the brain and body with the use of light. This is a
absolutely transformative technology, because whereas certain drug
treatments can often relieve certain symptoms of disorders, they often
carry various side effects. And in some individuals, often many
individuals, these drug treatments simply do not work. The
channelopsins and their related technologies stand to transform the
way that we treat psychiatric illness, and various disorders of
movement and perception. In fact, just recently, the channelopsins
were applied in a human patient, to allow an adult fully blind human
being to see light, for the very first time. We also discuss Dr.
Deisseroth's newly released book, which is entitled "Projections: A
Story of Human Emotions". This is an absolutely remarkable book, that
uses stories about his interactions with his patients, to teach you
how the brain works in the healthy and diseased state, and also
reveals the motivation for and discovery of these channelopsins and
other technologies by Karl's laboratory, that are being used now to
treat various disorders of the nervous system, and that in the future,
are certain to transform the fields of psychiatry, mental health, and
health in general. I found our conversation to be an absolutely
fascinating one about how the brain functions in the healthy state,
and why and how it breaks down in disorders of the mind. We also
discuss the current status and future of psychedelic treatments for
psychiatric illness, as well as we're understanding how the brain
works more generally. We also discuss issues of consciousness, and we
even delve into how somebody like Karl who's managing a full-time
clinical practice and a 40 plus person laboratory, and a family of
five children and is happily married, how he organizes his internal
landscape, his own thinking in order to manage that immense workload
and to progress forward for the sake of medicine and his pursuits in
science. I found this to be an incredible conversation, I learned so
much. I also learned, through the course of reading Karl's book,
"Projections", that not only is he an accomplished psychiatrist, and
obviously an accomplished research scientist and a family man, but
he's also a phenomenal writer. "Projections" is absolutely masterfully
written. It's just beautiful, and it's accessible to anybody, even if
you don't have a science background. So, I hope that you'll enjoy my
conversation with Karl Deisseroth as much as I did, and thank you for
tuning in. Before we begin, I want to point out that this podcast is
separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. In my desire
and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
and science related tools to the general public, I'd like to
acknowledge the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is
Roka. Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that in my opinion, are the
very highest quality out there. The company was founded by two All-
American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about the eyeglasses
and sunglasses was developed with performance in mind. One of the
things I really love about Roka sunglasses, is that unlike other
sunglasses that make it hard to see when there's a lot of cloud cover,
or when the shadows change or environmental conditions change, with
Roka sunglasses, they clearly understand the signs of the visual
system, because when I put them on for the first time, I noticed that
as I moved into shadows or the cloud cover changed or the day got
brighter or dimmer, everything was still crystal clear. And that's
also because the lenses are tremendously high optical clarity, and the
glasses are really lightweight. You don't even notice that they're on.
The other thing is that the eyeglasses, I wear readers at night,
they're incredibly lightweight, and for both the sunglasses and
eyeglasses, the aesthetic is terrific. Unlike a lot of performance
eyewear, which frankly can look kind of cyborg-like and kind of
ridiculous, the aesthetic of the glasses is such that you could really
wear them anywhere, indoors or outdoors. If you'd like to try Roka
eyeglasses, you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code
"Huberman", to save 20% on your first order. That's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,
and enter the code "Huberman", at checkout. Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized
nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA, to help
you better understand your body and reach your health goals. I'm a big
believer in getting regular blood work done. And now with the advent
of good genetic DNA tests, I'm also a believer in analyzing your DNA.
The simple reason for this is that many of the factors that impact our
immediate and longterm health, can only be measured and evaluated with
a quality blood test. And now, the DNA tests further inform our
immediate and long-term health. One of the problems with a lot of DNA
tests and blood tests out there however, is that you get the
information back, and you don't know what to do with that information.
With InsideTracker, you get the numbers back of different metabolic
factors, hormones, et cetera, but it also provides simple directives,
as to how perhaps you might want to change your nutritional intake or
your exercise regimen, or other lifestyle factors, to bring those
numbers into alignment with where you'd like them to be. InsideTracker
also makes this really easy. They have a dashboard that makes
organizing that all very simple, and they can even have someone come
to your house to take the blood and DNA test. If you'd like to try
InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman, to get 25%
off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code "Huberman", at

Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I
started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012, and I've taken it
ever since, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The
reason I started taking Athletic Greens and that I continue to take
Athletic Greens, is that it covers all my vitamin and mineral bases,
and it covers my probiotic needs. There's now a wealth of data showing
that probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome, and that a healthy
gut microbiome supports the gut brain access for healthy mood. It also
supports metabolism, immune function, endocrine, that means hormone
function, and a host of other important biological functions. I drink
it once or twice a day. I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon
juice or some lime juice, and it's absolutely delicious. If you'd like
to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and
if you do that, you can claim a special offer, where they will give
you a year's supply of vitamin D3. In addition, they'll give you five
free travel packs. Vitamin D3 as we all know, is very important for a
huge range of biological functions and health. Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman, for your Athletic Greens, the five free
travel packs, and the year's supply of vitamin D3. And now, my
conversation with Dr. Karl Deisseroth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=461"&gt;Using Language to Understand the Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, thanks for being here. Thanks for having me. It's been a long
time coming for me, because you may not know this, but one of the
reasons I started this podcast was actually so I could have this
conversation. [Karl laughs] It's but one, there are other reasons, but
one of the goals is to be able to hold conversations with colleagues
of mine that are doing incredible work in the realm of science, and
then here we also have this really special opportunity because you're
also a clinician. You see patients and have for a long time. So for
people that might not be so familiar with the fields of neuroscience,
et cetera, what is the difference between neurology and psychiatry?
Well, I'm married to a neurologist and I am a psychiatrist and we make
fun of each other all the time. A lot of neuroscientists and a lot of
brain clinicians actually think these two should be in the same field
at some point in the future, they were in the past, they started
together. Psychiatry though, focuses on disorders where we can't see
something that's physically wrong, where we don't have a measurable,
where there's no blood test that makes the diagnosis, there's no brain
scan that tells us this is schizophrenia, and this is depression for
an individual patient. And so psychiatry is much more mysterious, and
the only tools we have are words. Neurologists are fantastic
physicians. They see the stroke on brain scans, they see the seizure
and the pre-seizure activity with an EEG, and they can measure and
treat based on those measureables. In psychiatry, we have a harder
job, I think. We use words, we have rating scales for symptoms, we can
measure depression and autism with rating scales, but those are words
still. And ultimately, that's what psychiatry is built around. It's an
odd situation because we've got the most complex, beautiful,
mysterious, incredibly engineered object in the universe, and yet all
we have are words to find our way in. So, do you find that if a
patient is very verbal or hyper-verbal, that you have an easier time
diagnosing them, as opposed to somebody who's more quiet and reserved?
Or it's, I could imagine the opposite might be true as well. Well,
because we only have words, you've put your finger on a key point. If
they don't speak that much, in principle, it's harder. The lack of
speech can be a symptom. We can see that in depression, we can see
that in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, we can see that in
autism. Sometimes by itself, that is a symptom, reduced speech, but
ultimately you do need something. You need some words to help guide
you and in fact, there's challenges that I can tell you about where
patients with depression were so depressed, they can't speak. That
makes it a bit of a challenge to distinguish depression from some of
the other reasons they might not be speaking. And this is sort of the
art and the science of psychiatry. Do you find that there are patients
that have, well, let's call them comorbidities or conditions where
they would land in both psychiatry and neurology, meaning there's
damage to a particular area of the brain and therefore they're
depressed? And how do you tease that out as a psychiatrist? Yeah, this
happens all the time. Parkinson's disease is a great example. It can
be debilitating in so many ways. People have trouble moving, they have
trouble walking, they have trouble swallowing, and they can have a
truly severe depression. And this is where you might say, "Oh, well,
they've got a life-threatening illness", but there are plenty of
neurological disorders where depression is not a strongly comorbid
symptom, like ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, for example, depression is
not strongly comorbid in that disease, but in Parkinson's, it is
extremely common. And as you know, in Parkinson's disease, we have
loss of the dopamine neurons in the midbrain. And this is a very
specific population of cells that's dying, and probably that leads to
both the movement disorder and the depression. There are many examples
of that where these two fields come together and you really need to
work as a team. I've had patients in my clinic, that I treat the
depression associated with their Parkinson's, and a neurologist treats
the movement associated with the Parkinson's and we work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=739"&gt;Blood Tests For Mental Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think we will ever have a blood test for depression or
schizophrenia or autism? And would that be a good or a bad thing? I
think ultimately there will be quantitative tests. Already, efforts
are being made to look at certain rhythms in the brain using external
EEGs to look at brain waves effectively, look at the ratios of certain
frequencies to other frequencies, and there's some progress being made
on that front. It's not as good as it could be. It doesn't really give
you the confidence for the individual patient that you would like, but
ultimately, what's going on in the brain in psychiatric disease is
physical, and it's due to the circuits and the connections and the
projections in the brain that are not working as they would in a
typical situation. And I do think we'll have those measureables at
some point. Now, is that good or bad? I think that will be good, and
one of the challenges we have with psychiatry is it is an art as well
as a science to elicit these symptoms in a precise way. It does take
some time, and it would be great if we could just do quick
measurements. Could it be abused or misused? Certainly. But that's I
think true, for all of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=818"&gt;The Largest Challenges Facing Treatment of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to know, and I'm sure there are several, but what do you see as
the biggest challenge facing psychiatry and the treatment of mental
illness today? I think we're making progress on what the biggest
challenge is, which I think there's still such a strong stigma for
psychiatric disease that patients often don't come to us, and they
feel that they should be able to handle this on their own. And that
can slow treatment. It can lead to worsening symptoms. We know, for
example, patients who have untreated anxiety issues. If you go for a
year or more with a serious untreated anxiety issue, that can convert
to depression. You can add another problem on top of the anxiety. And
so it would be... Why do people not come for treatment? They feel like
this is something they should be able to master on their own, which
can be true, but usually, some help is a good thing. That raises a
question related to something I heard you say many years ago at a
lecture, which was that, this was a scientific lecture and you said,
"We don't know how other people feel. Most of the time, we don't even
really know how we feel." [chuckles] Yeah. [Andrew] Maybe you could
elaborate on that a little bit and the dearth of ways that we have to
talk about feelings. I mean, there's so many words. I don't know how
many, but I'm guessing they're more than a dozen words to describe the
state that I call sadness, but as far as I understand, we don't have
any way of comparing that in a real objective sense. As a
psychiatrist, when your job is to use words to diagnose, words of the
patient to diagnose, do you maneuver around that? And what is this
landscape that we call feelings or emotions? This is really
interesting. Here there's a tension between the words that we've built
up in the clinic that mean something to the physicians, and then
there's the colloquial use of words that may not be the same, and so
that's the first level we have to sort out when someone says, "I'm
depressed", what exactly do they mean by that? And that may be
different from what we're talking about in terms of depression. So
part of psychiatry is to get beyond that word, and to get into how
they're actually feeling, get rid of the jargon and get to real world
examples of how they're feeling. So, how much do you look forward into
the future? How much hope do you have? How much planning are you doing
for the future? So here now you're getting into actual things you can
talk about that are unambiguous. If someone says, "Yeah, I can't even
think about tomorrow. I don't see how I'm going to get to tomorrow".
That's a nice, precise thing that you know, it's sad, it's tragic, but
also, that means something. And we know what that means. That's the
hopelessness symptom of depression. And that is what I try to do when
I do a psychiatric interview. I try to get past the jargon, and get to
what's actually happening in a patient's life and in their mind. But
as you say, ultimately, [chuckles] and this shows up across... I
address this issue every day in my life, whether it's in the lab where
we're looking at animals, whether fish or mice or rats and studying
their behavior, or when I'm in a conversation with just a friend or a
colleague, or when I'm talking to a patient, I never really know
what's going on inside the mind of the other person. I get some
feedback, I get words, I get behaviors, I get actions, but I never
really know. And as you said at the very beginning of the question,
often we don't even have the words and the insight to even understand
what's going on in our own mind. I think a lot of psychiatrists are
pretty introspective. That's part of the reason they end up in that
specialty, and so, maybe we spend a little more time than the average
person thinking about what's going on within, but it doesn't mean we
have the answers. So in this area of trying to figure out what's going
on under the hood through words, it sounds like certain words would
relate to this idea of anticipation and hope. Is it fair to say that
that somehow relates to the dopamine system in the sense that dopamine
is involved in motivated behaviors? I mean, if I say for instance, and
I won't ask you to run a session with me here [chuckles] for free.
[Karl laughs] We'll do that off camera. [Andrew] Off camera. Right. If
I were to say, "I just can't imagine tomorrow. I just can't do it." So
that's not an action-based, that's purely based on my internal
narrative, but I could imagine things like, you know, I have a
terrible time sleeping, I'm not hungry, I'm not eating, so statements
about physical actions, I'm guessing also have validity. Absolutely.
And there are now ways to measure the accuracy of those statements.
Like for instance, if I gave you permission, you could know if I slept
last night, or whether or not I was just saying I had a poor night's
sleep. Yes. That's right. So in moving forward through 2021 and into
the next 10 and 100 years of psychiatry, do you think that the body
reporting some of the actions of a human are going to become useful
and mesh with the words in a way that's going to make your job easier?
I do think that's true. And the two things you've mentioned, eating
and sleeping, those are additional criteria that we use to diagnose
depression. These are the vegetative signs, we call them of
depression, poor sleep, and poor eating. And if you have a baseline
for somebody, that's the real challenge there. What's different in
that person? Some people with depressed, they sleep more. Some people
who are depressed, they sleep less. Some people who are depressed,
they're more physically agitated, and they move around more. Some
people who are depressed, they move less even while they're awake. And
so you need... Here's the challenge is that you can't just look at how
they are now. You have to get a baseline, and then see how it's
changed. And that can be a challenge that raises ethical issues, and
how do you collect that baseline information from someone healthy? I
don't think that's something we have solved. Of course, with phones
and accelerometers and phones, you could in principle, collect a lot
of baseline information from people, but that would have to be treated
very carefully for privacy reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=1221"&gt;Predicting Depression &amp;amp; Suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in terms of measuring one's own behavior, I've heard of work
that's going on. Sam Golden up in the University of Washington who
works on aggression in animal models was telling me that there's some
efforts that he's making, and perhaps you're involved in this work as
well, I don't know, of devices that would allow people to detect, for
instance, when they're veering towards a depressive episode for
themselves, that they may choose or not choose to report that to their
clinician, maybe they don't even have a clinician. Maybe this person
that you referred to at the beginning, this person who doesn't feel
comfortable coming to talk to you, maybe something is measuring
changes in the inflection of their voice, or the speed at which they
get up from a chair. Do you think that those kind of metrics will
eventually inform somebody, "Hey, you know, you're in trouble"? This
is getting to back to the statement that I heard you make and it rung
in my mind now, I think for more than a decade, which is, "Oftentimes,
we don't even know how we feel." Yeah. You know, that I do like,
because that gives the patient the agency to detect what's going on,
and even separate from modern technology, this has been part of the
art of psychiatry is to help patients realize that sometimes other
people observing them can give them the earliest warning signs of
depression. We see this very often in family. They'll notice when the
patient is changing before the patient does. And then there are things
the patient may notice, but not correctly ascribe to the onset of
depression. And a classic example of that is what we call 'early
morning awakening'. And this is something that can happen very early
as people start to slide into depression. They start to wake up
earlier and earlier, just inexplicably, they're awake at This is like
2:00 AM, 3:00 AM awakening? It could start... Yeah, it could start at
5:00 AM, could go to four, and three- - And are unable to fall back
asleep? Unable to fall back asleep. Exactly. And they may not know
what to do with that. It could just be, [chuckles] from their
perspective, it's just something that's happening. But if you put
enough of that information together, that could be a useful warning
sign for the patient and it could help them seek treatment. And I
think that is something that could be really valuable. Interesting.
So, in this framework of needing words to self-report or machines to
detect how we feel and maybe inform a psychiatrist how a patient
feels, touch on some of the technologies that you've been involved in
building, but as a way to march into that, are there any very good
treatments for psychiatric disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=1367"&gt;Drugs That Work for Brain Illness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning, are there currently any pills, potions, forms of
communication that reliably work every time, or work in most patients?
And could you give a couple examples of great successes of psychiatry
if they exist? Yes. Yeah, we are fortunate. And this [chuckles] coming
back to my, you know, the joking between my wife and myself in terms
of neurology and psychiatry, we actually in psychiatry, despite the
depths of the mystery we struggled with, many of our treatments are
actually... We may be doing better than some other specialties in
terms of actually causing therapeutic benefit for patients. We do help
patients, the patients who suffer from... By the way, both medications
and talk therapy have been shown to be extremely effective in many
cases, for example, people with panic disorder, cognitive behavioral
therapy, just working with words, helping people identify the early
signs of when they're starting to move toward a panic attack, what are
the cognitions that are happening? You can train people to derail
that, and you can very potently treat panic disorder that way. How
long does something like that take on average? For a motivated,
insightful patient, you can have a very cookbooky series of sessions,
that's six to 12 sessions, or even less for someone who's very
insightful and motivated and it can have a very powerful effect that
quickly. And that's just with words, there are many psychiatric
medications that are very effective for the conditions that they're
treating. Anti-psychotic medications, they have side effects, but boy,
do they work! They really can clear up particularly the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia for example, the auditory hallucinations,
the paranoia, people's lives can be turned around by these We should
clarify positive symptoms. You mean not positive in the qualitative
sense, you mean positive meaning that the appearance of something
abnormal. Exactly. Yeah. Thank you for that clarification. When we say
positive symptoms, we do mean the addition of something that wasn't
there before, like a hallucination or a paranoia, and that stands in
contrast to the negative symptoms where something is taken away, and
these are patients who are withdrawn. They have what we call thought
blocking. They can't even progress forward in a sequence of thoughts.
Both of those can be part of schizophrenia, the hallucinations and the
paranoia are more effectively treated right now, but they are
effectively treated. And then, this is a frustrating, and yet
heartening aspect of psychiatry. There are treatments like
electroconvulsive therapy, where it's extremely effective for
depression. We have patients who nothing else works for them, where
they can't tolerate medications, and you can administer under a very
safe, controlled condition, where the patient's body is not moving.
They're put into a very safe situation where the body doesn't move or
cease, it's just an internal process that's triggered in the brain.
This is an extraordinarily effective treatment for treatment-resistant
depression. At the same time, I find it [chuckles] as heartening as it
is to see patients respond to this who have severe depression, I'm
also frustrated by it. Why can't we do something more precise than
this, for these very severe cases? And people have sought for decades
to understand, how is it that a seizure is leading to the relief of
depression? And we don't know the answer yet. We would love to do
that. People are working hard on that, but that is a treatment that
does work too. In all of these cases though in psychiatry, the
frustrating thing is that we don't have the level of understanding
that a cardiologist has in thinking about the heart. You know, the
heart is, we now know it's a pump. It's pumping blood. and so you can
look at everything about how it's working or not working, in terms of
that frame, it's clearly a pump. We don't really have that level of,
what is the circuit really there for in psychiatry? And that's what is
missing. That's what we need to find, so we can design truly effective
and specific treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=1621"&gt;What Would A Cure For the Broken Mind Look Like?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the pieces that are going to be required to cure autism,
cure Parkinson's, cure schizophrenia? I would imagine there are
several elements and 'beens here', understanding the natural biology,
understanding what the activity patterns are, how to modify those,
maybe you could just tell us what you think, what is the Bento Box of
the perfect cure? I think the first thing we need is understanding.
Almost every psychiatric treatment has been serendipitously
identified, just noting by chance that something that was done for
some person also had a side effect Like lithium or something Like
lithium, is a good example. Is it true that it was the urine of guinea
pigs [Karl laughs] given lithium that was given to manic patients that
made them not manic? Is that true? I don't have firsthand knowledge of
that, but I would defer that, but it's true for essentially every
treatment, that the antidepressants originally arose as anti-
tuberculosis drugs, for example. I did not know that. Yeah, and so
this is a classic example for illnesses across all of psychiatry, and
of course there's the seizures as well. That was noticed that patients
who had epilepsy, they had a seizure there and also had depression,
that they became much, at least for awhile, they were improved after
that seizure. That's amazing. I don't want to take you off course of
the question answering the question I asked, but I've heard before
that if autistic children get a fever, that their symptoms improve, is
that true? I've done a fair bit of work with autism. In my clinical
practice, I work with adult autism and I have heard statements like
that and descriptions like that from patients and their families. That
is very hard to study quantitatively because often with the children,
you have this not as quantitative as you'd like collection of symptom
information from home. But I have heard that enough that I think there
may well be something to that. And anytime you have a fever, what's
going on? Well, we know all the cells in the brain, and I know this as
an electrophysiologist, if you just change the temperature by a few
degrees, everything changes about how neurons work and that's even
just a single neuron. It's even more likely to be complex and
different with a circuit of neurons that are all affecting each other.
Just elevate the temperature a little bit, everything's different. And
so, it's plausible for sure, that things like that could happen and do
happen. And yet, when you think about autism, to take your example,
yes, we see changes, but what is the elements of the brain that's
analogous to the pumping heart? When we think about the symptoms of
depression, we think about motivation and dopamine neurons. When we
think about autism, it's a little more challenging. There's a deficit
in social interaction and in communication. And so where is that?
[chuckles] Where is that situated? What is the key principle governing
the social interaction? This is where we need the basic science to
bring us a step forward, so we can say okay, this is the process
that's going on. This is what's needed for the incredibly complex task
of social interaction, where you've got incredibly rich data streams
of sound and meaning, eye contact, body movement, and that's just for
one person. What if there's a group of people? This is overwhelming
for people with autism. What's the unifying thing there? It's a lot of
information, and that maybe is unmatched in any realm of biology, the
amount of information coming in through a social interaction,
particularly with words and language. And so then, that turns our
attention as neuroscientists, we think, okay, let's think about the
parts of the brain that are involved in dealing with merging complex
data streams that are very high in bit rate that need to be fused
together into a unitary concept. And that starts to guide us, and we
know other animals are social in their own way, and we can study those
animals. And so that's how I think about it. There's hope for the
future, thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might, and trying
to identify the circuits that are likely working to make this typical
behavior happen, and that will help us understand how it becomes
atypical. So that seems like the first to me, the first been of this,
what I call the Bento Box for lack of a better analogy, that we need
to know the circuits. We need to know the cells in the various brain
regions and end portions of the body and how they connect to one
another, and what the patterns of activity are under a normal 'healthy
interaction'. [Karl] Yeah. If we understand that, then it seems that
the next step, which of course could be carried out in parallel,
right? Though that work can be done alongside work where various
elements within those circuits are tweaked just right, like the tuning
of a piano in the subtle way, or maybe even like the replacement of a
whole set of keys if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak. Right.
You've been very involved in trying to generate those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=1943"&gt;Channelopsins: Tools For Understanding &amp;amp; Treating the Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell us about channelopsins, why you created them, and where they're
at now in the laboratory and perhaps also in the clinic. Well, first
of all, I give nature the credit for creating channelrhodopsins. These
are beautiful little proteins that are made by algae, single-celled
green algae. And there's a great story in basic science that our
understanding of animal behavior, sensation, cognition and action in
our brains all the way back to a botanist in the 1850s and 1860s in
Russia, is where the story begins. So this was a botanist named Andrei
Famintsyn who worked at St. Petersburg, and he had noticed in the
river near his laboratory, that there were algae that he could look at
in a dish, in a saucer. He could put them there and he had light
shining from the side. The green tinge in the saucer of water would
move to a particular distance from the light that he was shining from
the side, which was an amazing thing. If he made the light brighter,
the green tinge would back off a little bit to a more optimal
location, so just the right light level. So this was plant behavior.
It was light-driven plant behavior, and he delves into this a little
bit. He identified that with microscopy, he could see that there were
little single-cell algae with flagella that were swimming to the right
light level. So behaving plants, and this has been the secret that's
helped us unlock so many principles of animal behavior. So turns out,
these algae achieve this amazing results with a single gene that
encodes a single protein. What's a protein? It's just a little bio-
molecule that does a job in a cell. And these are proteins that sit in
the surface of cells in their surface membrane, and when a photon, a
light particle hits them, they open a little pore, a little hole in
the membrane and charged particles, ions like sodium rush across the
pore. Now, why do they do that? They do that to guide their flagella,
that signal coming in, those ions coming in through the pore in
response to light, guide their flagella motor, that guides them to a
particular spot in the saucer. Now, that's plant behavior, but it
turns out, as you know, this movement of ions across the membrane,
this happens to also be a neural code in our brains for on or off.
Sodium ions rushing into the cells, turns them on. It makes them fire
away, fire action potentials communicate to the next cell down the
chain, and this is an amazing opportunity because we can borrow these
proteins. In fact, we can take the gene that directs the creation of
the protein, and we can use genetic tricks, modern genetic tricks to
put that gene into neurons in the brains of mammals, and then use
light to turn those cells, the specific cells that we put this gene
into, turn them on. There are other opsins, we call them, that you can
use to turn cells off. It's all fast, real time. You can play in
patterns of activity in real time into cells or kinds of cells, just
as a conductor elicits the music from the orchestra, the strings and
the woodwinds. And you can see what matters. What matters for
sensation, what matters for cognition, what matters for action, and we
call this optogenetics. Beautiful, and I must say it was quite an
honor and a privilege to watch optogenetics move from idea to
discovery to the laboratory. I think we were postdocs at the same
time, We were, huh? which is living proof that people move at
different rates, because [laughs] it's a joke at my expense by the
way, [Karl laughing] but it's really We end up in the same spot.
[laughs] That's right, [laughs] yeah, more or less. Physically, if not
professionally, but nonetheless, it's been a marvelous story thus far.
And I'd like to... Maybe you could give us... I'd like to just touch
on a couple examples of where the technology resides in laboratories
now, so maybe the range of animals that it's being used in, and some
of the phenomenon that channelrhodopsins and their related genes and
proteins are starting to elicit, what you've seen, and then I'd like
to talk about their applicability to the clinic, which is I think the
bigger mission, if you will. Yeah. So this whole thing, you know, it's
been about, now going on 17 years that we've been putting
channelrhodopsins into neurons. It started just like Andre Famintsyn's
work in a dish, that was in 2004. In 2007, we were putting these into
behaving mice, and we were able to with a flick of a switch, cause
them to move one direction or another, by 2009 So basically, you're
controlling the mouse's behavior? Yeah, exactly. In real time. So we
could make a mouse that was just sitting there doing nothing, to then
turn left very consistently, in fact, go around in a circle and as
soon as we turn off the light, it would stop. That was an eye-opening
moment. It took really a few years to make optogenetics work. There
was a lot of putting all the... There are a lot of problems that had
to be solved. These channelrhodopsins actually don't move many ions.
They have a small current, small conductance, as we say. And so we had
to figure out ways to pack a lot of them into cells without damaging
cells, and still make them targetable, so we don't want them to just
be in all the cells, 'cause then it becomes just like an electrode.
You're just stimulating all the cells that are nearby. We had to keep
that specificity, make them targetable to just one kind of cell or
another, while still packing in large numbers of them into those
cells. And we had to get in the light in safe and specific ways, and
so it took probably about four or five years to really create
optogenetics between 2004 and 2009. By the end of that time though, we
had all the basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked
out, and people started to apply the technology to fish, to rats, to
mice, to non-human primates like monkeys, and just a couple months
ago, my colleague, Botond Rosca in Switzerland, succeeded in putting
channelrhodopsins into the eyes of human beings and making a blind
person to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=2350"&gt;Curing Blindness with Channelopsins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so that's pretty cool. This was a patient with retinal
degeneration, and he provided a channelrhodopsin into the eye of this
patient and was able to confer some light sensitivity onto this
patient that wasn't there before. An amazing paper and discovery. I
realize it was one patient, but it's such an important milestone.
Well, as you say, it's a very important milestone and the history of
that is very deep. Almost 10 years earlier, Botond Rosca and I had
published a paper in science in human retina, but X plants taken from
cadavers from someone who had died, the living retina taken out,
opsins put into this retinal tissue and showing that it worked,
recording from the cells showing that in these human retinal neurons,
that you could get light responses. But then, from that moment, almost
10 years of how clinical development goes, and this is a gene therapy
and so you've got all the regulations and concerns and all that. It
took almost 10 years to get to this point now where a living human
being has a new functionality that wasn't there before. Now, that's
incredibly inspiring, and it's a beautiful thing. I would say though,
that the broader significance of optogenetics is really still
understanding, because once you understand how the circuitry works and
which cells actually matter, then any kind of treatment becomes more
grounded and logical and specific and principled. And whether it's a
medication, or a talk therapy or brain stimulation treatment with
electrical or magnetic means, if you actually know what matters,
[chuckles] that is incredibly powerful. And I think, not intended to
disparage the beautiful retinal work and conferring vision on someone
who couldn't see, of course that's wonderful, and that's direct what
you might call direct optogenetics in patients. Indirect is everything
that comes from understanding. Okay, we know these cells matter now,
for this symptom. Well, how can we target those cells and help them
work better in patients by any means? And I think that's the broader
significance of optogenetics, clinically. I know Botond well, and you
and Botond share this incredible big vision, that I think only a
clinician can really understand, being in close contact within the
suffering of patients as a ultimate motivator of developing
technologies, which makes me have to ask, did you decide to become a
scientist to find cures for mental disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=2518"&gt;Why Karl Became a Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[chuckles] No, I didn't. It's a really important question to actually
look back and see the steps that brought you to a particular place.
And that was not what brought me initially to science and it's okay I
think, to embrace [chuckles] the twists and turns that life brings to
you, but I was always interested in the brain. And so, that was
something that for me started from a very early age. We talked about
being introspective. I noticed very early on I had a deep love of
poetry and stories, and I was a voracious reader, and I was amazed by
how words could make me feel in particular ways. Even separate from
their, of course, dictionary meanings, the rhythm, and how they work
together, even separate from meaning. And I was stunned by poets that
could use words in new ways that were even divorced from their meaning
at all, and yet could still trigger specific emotions. And this was
always fascinating to me. So, I wanted to understand that, and so I
was interested and I became interested in the brain and I thought,
well, I'm going to to have to study the human brain, because only
human beings can describe what's going on inside enough. So in
college, I began to steer myself toward medicine, with the idea of
becoming a neurosurgeon. And so I came here to medical school, and did
an MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery all the way through. The
first rotation I did at the end of medical school, as you know, you do
rotations, you go through different specialties, and some of these are
required rotations, everybody has to do this summary elective where
you can pick what you want to do. I elected to do the neurosurgery
first, [chuckles] even before regular surgery. I was that sure I
wanted to do it, and I loved it. I had a fantastic time. There was an
amazing patient who had a thalamic damage, and there was a neglect
syndrome where the patient was not able to be aware of something that
was right in front of him Even though their vision was perfectly fine?
Even though their vision was perfectly fine, exactly. And I loved the
operating room, I loved the rhythm of suturing and the precision of
it, and I loved being able to help patients immediately, but then a
required rotation was in psychiatry, which I was not looking forward
to at all. And that completely reset my whole life, that experience in
psychiatry. And it was at that moment that I saw this is first of all,
the greatest need, the depth of suffering and the depth of the mystery
together. And also it was, I almost feel a little guilty about this.
It's so interesting too. Yes, we can help. Yes, there's need, but as a
scientist, this is amazing, that someone's reality can be different
from my own, with everything physically, as far as we can tell the
same with the measures we have, and yet we've got a different reality.
That is an amazing thing, and if we can understand that and help these
people, that would be just more than anybody could ask for. And so
that's how I ended up taking this path, just a required rotation in
psychiatry. It all started with poetry? And it started with poetry.
Out of respect for poetry, are there any favorites that you spend time
with on a regular basis? I mean, the ones who got me down this path
early on, I remember in childhood and high school, Borges had an
immense influence on me. I studied Spanish all the way through and
reading his work. He was a great writer. He wrote both in English and
in Spanish and being able to appreciate his poetry both in English and
in Spanish was a pretty amazing thing. Not many poets can do that.
You're bilingual? I'm not, I wouldn't say. Now I became, at one point
I was effectively fluent in Spanish, and I'm pretty good with medical
Spanish still because we use Spanish all the time in the clinic here.
I wouldn't claim full fluency, but it's something I can definitely use
all the time. And that's been very helpful in the clinic. Yeah, Borges
is wonderful. As the son of an Argentine, I grew up hearing about it
and I learned that Borges' favorite city was Geneva. So I spent time
in Geneva only for that reason. It's also turns out [Karl laughs] to
be an interesting city. Yes. So you developed methods to control
neurons with these algae proteins using light? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=2830"&gt;Vagus Nerve In Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, there was what I thought was a very nice article published in
the New Yorker, describing your work and the current state of your
work in the laboratory and the clinic, and an interaction with a
patient. So this as I recall, a woman who was severely depressed, and
you reported in that article some of the discussion with this patient,
and then in real time, increased the activation of the so-called vagus
nerve, this 10th cranial nerve that extends out of the skull and
innervates many of the viscera and body. What is the potential for
channelrhodopsins or related types of algae engineering to be used to
manipulate the vagus? Because I believe in that instance, it wasn't
channelopsin stimulation, it was electrical stimulation, right? Or to
manipulate for instance, a very small localized region of the brain?
Let me frame it a little bit differently in light of what we were
talking about a couple minutes ago. My understanding is that if
somebody has severe depression and they take any number of the
available pharmaceutical agents that are out there, SSRI, serotonergic
agents, increased dopamine, increased whatever, that sometimes they
experience relief, but they're often serious side effects. Sometimes
they don't experience relief, but as I understand it, channelopsins
and their related technology, in principle, would allow you to turn on
or off the specific regions of the brain that lead to the depressive
symptoms, or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit, or a positive
anticipation circuit. Where are we at now in terms of bringing this
technology to the nervous system? And let's start with the body, and
then move into the skull. Yup. So starting with the body is a good
example because it highlights the opportunity and how far we have to
go. So let's take this example of vagus nerve stimulation. So the
vagus nerve, it's the 10th cranial nerve. It comes from the brain, it
goes down and innervates the heart and innervates the gut. And by
innervate, I mean it sends little connections down to help guide what
happens in these organs in the abdomen and chest. It also collects
information back, and there's information coming back from all those
organs that also go through this vagus nerve, the 10th cranial nerve,
back to the brain. And so this is somewhat of a super highway to the
brain, and it was the idea. And maybe the idea is maybe we could put a
little cuff, a little electrical device around the vagus nerve itself,
and maybe have just like a pacemaker battery, have a little power
source here under the clavicle, everything under the skin, and have a
little cuff and drive signals, and maybe they'll get back to the
brain. So a way of getting into the brain without putting something
physical into the brain. And why the vagus? I mean, it's there and
it's accessible That's the reason. [chuckles] That's the reason?
[chuckles] That's the reason, yes. Really? Yeah. You're not kidding?
[Karl] I'm not kidding. So stimulating the vagus to treat depression,
simply because it's accessible. It started actually as an epilepsy
treatment and it can help with epilepsy, but yes, it's simple. God,
you got to love medicine. As a scientist, this is where I get to
chuckle and you say, I'm in the field of medicine from that
perspective. From the perspective of a scientist and outsider, the
field of medicine is a field that goes in and tickles pathways because
they're there. I don't know what to say. It's a little shocking. Yeah.
And at least in my laboratory, I always say you never do an experiment
because you can, you do an experiment to test a specific hypothesis.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there are stories people tell so that the vagus
nerve lands on a particular spot on the brain called the solitary
tract nucleus, which is just one snaps away from the serotonin and
dopamine and the norepinephrine So there's a link to chemical systems
in the brain that make an irrational choice? Yes. It's not irrational,
but I can tell you that even if that were not true, the same thing
would have been tried. [Andrew laughs] You guys would have done it
anyway. Because it's accessible. Yeah. [Andrew] I see. Okay. And why?
Well, it's again, not to disparage what's been happening in this
branch of medicine. There's immense suffering, many treatments don't
work, and we try things. And this is how so many advances in medicine
happen. When think about kidney dialysis which has kept many people
alive, that was just started by someone saying, "Hey, let's try this.
Maybe there's something building up in the blood and maybe we can
dialyze something and help them." Yeah, it worked. And it was just
sort of a test pilot mentality. We can access the blood, let's run it
across a dialysis membrane, put it back in the body, oh my God, that
actually works. And sometimes you do need that test pilot mentality,
of course, to do it in a rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. which
is what we do. And so, anyway, that's how we ended up, but still with
the vagus nerve stimulation, okay, so what is it? Does it work? It
has, it's FDA approved for depression, this vagus nerve stimulation,
but on a population level, if you average across all people, the
effect sizes are pretty small. Some patients it has an amazing effect
in, but some patients it doesn't work at all, and average across
everybody, the effect size is pretty small. How do you think it's
working when it does work? Is it triggering the activation of neurons
that release more serotonin or dopamine? It could be, but I would say
we don't have evidence for that and so I just don't know. But what is
clear, is that it's dose-limited in how high and strongly we can
stimulate and why, it's because it's an electrode, and it's
stimulating everything nearby. And when you turn on the vagus nerve
stimulator, the patient's voice becomes strangulated and hoarse, they
can have trouble swallowing, they can have trouble speaking for sure,
even some trouble breathing, because everything in the neck, every
electrically responsive cell and projection in the neck is being
affected by this electrode. And so you can go up just so far with the
intensity, and then you have to stop. So, to your initial question,
could a more precise stimulation method like optogenetics help in the
setting? In principle, it could, because if you would target the light
sensitivity to just the right kind of cell, let's say cell X that goes
from point A to point B that you know, causes symptom relief of a
particular kind, then you're in business. You can have that be the
only cell that's light sensitive. You're not going to affect any of
the other cells, the larynx and the pharynx and the projections
passing through. So that's the hope, that's the opportunity. The
problem, is that we don't yet have that level of specific knowledge.
We don't know, okay, it's the cells starting at point A going to point
B, that relieves this particular symptom. We want to fix this key on
the piano? Yeah. And then I see two other steps that are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=3252"&gt;Challenges To Overcome for Treating Mental Illness with Channelopsins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is to get the channelopsin gene into the cell. In the case of
Botond Rosca and colleagues rescuing vision in this patient, they did
that by an injection of a virus that doesn't damage the neurons. The
virus itself is fairly innocuous, but carries a cargo, and it's a one-
time injection, the cells express, and then they used light to
stimulate. So, let's say I'm depressed, which I don't think I am,
although now sitting in front of a psychiatrist, [Karl laughs] you
probably can see signs that maybe I am or maybe I'm not, but let's say
we put channelopsin into a specific branch of the vagus that we
understand is responsible for mood, how are we going to get it in
there? And, then how are we going to deliver the light? 'Cause we're
not talking about sunlight or standing in front of a light bulb
necessarily, what are the mechanisms for the body? Yeah. So we had to
solve exactly these questions you're saying. How do you get the light
in? How do you get the gene in, in a potent and robust and safe way?
And that's now solved, and that's not a challenge. So there are very
safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms that are called adeno-
associated viruses, AAVs, and these are things that are associated
with the common cold. They themselves don't cause any symptoms.
They've been engineered, and there's been a broad community of viral
engineering that's been going on for decades making these safer, well-
tolerated, and so on. We can put the channelrhodopsin gene into these
viral vectors that deliver the gene and we can have little bits of
additional DNA that govern expression only in one kind of cell, but
not another. These are called promoters and enhancers, all genetic
tricks built up by a very broad community of great scientists over the
decades. We can put these different bits of DNA, package them into
this AAV, this little virus, and that can be then injected into a
particular part of the body, and sticking with this vagus nerve
example, we know that there are particular clumps of neurons. There's
one called the nodose ganglion that has a clump of cells related to
the vagus nerve, and you could for example, target a little injection
into that ganglion Would that be an outpatient procedure? Yep. Yep. So
you come in in the morning, get your injection, maybe walk out a few
hours later? Yeah. That's right. And so that's the gene, then the
light delivery, this is also something that we've worked out. We've
worked on making very, very light-sensitive opsins. One challenge, and
Botond would be the first to state this in fact, [chuckles] in solving
this problem for the patient, he had to build goggles that created
much brighter light than the normal ambient light delivery, because as
I mentioned earlier, you have to pack a lot of these channelrhodopsins
in, they don't have much current. You have to really make sure that
you've got a tense enough light to activate enough of them to cause a
stimulation And it has to be the right wavelength, right? It has to be
the right wavelength And going back to your example of the algae
moving toward or away the light, it has to be tuned just right. So I'm
imagining in my mind as a non-engineer, I know you're [chuckles] also
a bioengineer, I'm imagining a little tiny blue light-emitting object,
that's a little bigger than a clump of cells, or maybe about the size
of a clump of cells. And for those that don't know, your credit card
is about 200 microns thick on the side, and a micron is a thousandths
of a millimeter, and so we're talking about a little tiny stamp that's
basically half a millimeter in size all around. Each edge, half a
millimeter in size. I can imagine that being put under my skin, and
then I would what, I'd hit an app on my phone, and I'd say, "Dr.
Deisseroth, I'm not feeling great today. Can I increase the
stimulation?" And you'd say, "Go for it." And then I'd ramp it up. Is
that how it would go? I mean, that's effectively what we already do
with the vagus nerve stimulation. The doctor in this case, and I have
this in some of my patients in the clinic, I do vagus nerve
stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=3514"&gt;Using the Dialogue with Patients to Guide Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk to them, I say, "How are you?" I go through the symptoms, I use
the psychiatric interview to elicit their internal states, and then I
have a radio frequency controller that I can dial in Right there in
real time? Right there in real time. You're holding the remote control
essentially to their brain, although it's remote controlled? Yeah,
through a couple of steps, but yeah. And I can turn up the frequency,
I can turn up the intensity, all with the radio frequency and control,
and then it's reprogrammed or redosed, and then the patient can then
leave at this altered dose. So this is happening now? This is
happening right now, electrically. You do this routinely? I do it
routinely in my clinic, electrically, yeah. And you're getting the
verbal content, which as you described earlier, is the indication of
how well something is working in real time? Yes. So this is what,
maybe you could just describe a little bit of the interaction with
that particular patient or another patient, what's a typical arc of
narrative as you go from no stimulation to increased stimulation? In
most patients, the actual therapeutic effects, the benefits actually
take many days to weeks, and so what I'm mostly focusing on in the
office in real time, is making sure I'm in a safe, low side effect
regime. And so first I talk to the patient who has been on a
particular dose of the stimulation for weeks or longer, and I talk
about symptoms, how were things over the past month? How was your
hope? How was your energy level? Sleep? What is your mood? And then we
talk with the patient and we decide, well, this is not yet where we'd
like to be. And so then, I can turn up the intensity of the
stimulation in real time in the office. In most patients, I don't
expect an immediate mood change. What I do, is I increase the dose
until a next level up, while asking the patient for side effects. Can
you still breathe? Okay. Can you still swallow? Okay. And I can hear
their voice as well. And I can get a sense And you're looking at their
face? And I'm looking at their face. Yeah. - And so I can get a sense,
am I still on a safe side effect regime? And then, I stop at a
particular point that looks safe, and then the patient goes home,
comes back a month later, and I get the report on how things were over
that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=3652"&gt;How Our Eyes Reveal Our Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if you're looking at their face, 'cause in your book, you
describe the incredible complexity of social interactions. And at one
point, you describe the incredible amount of information that the eyes
inform about the brain and the context of somebody's inner experience,
whether depressed or happy or otherwise. Yeah. I want to make sure
that we get back to how to maneuver and manipulate the nervous system
for the sake of mental health. But, what are you looking for? So as a
vision scientist, I think pupils dilating is a sign of arousal, but
that could be a positive arousal, positive valence, like excitement,
or it could be terror. Yeah. You're going to get the same dilation of
the pupils. And I'm always reminding people that these two little
goodies are two pieces of brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] they're
just outside the cranial vault. So they're not unlike the vagus in
that sense, but they're more of a report than a control knob, although
I'd like to think they could be used as control knobs too. So, without
putting you on the spot, again, to diagnose me, [Karl laughs] that's
something I would never ask you to do [Karl laughing] with the cameras
rolling, but what are you looking for that the patient might not be
aware of? In other words, can you see depression in somebody's eyes?
And if you know a patient or if you don't, can you see it in their
body posture when they walk in? Realizing of course, that a trained
psychiatrist like yourself, develops an intuitive sense that's
aggregating lots of different features of a patient, but what about
the eyes? What's going on there? Yeah. The eyes are incredibly rich in
information. And as you alluded to though, it's not as if any one
measurable conveys all the information you need. It's what an engineer
would say, joint statistics. It's many things all at once, whether
they're in synchrony or out of synchrony, that actually turns out to
matter. And the eye contact question, we all know eye contact is
incredibly important. You don't feel you've connected with somebody,
unless there's eye contact, but eye contact can go awry too. It can be
too intense, or it can be mistimed, or if there's someone with autism,
it can be barely there at all. And this is one of the most striking
symptoms of autism, is the avoidance of eye contact, almost as if it's
a harmful quantity. And so there's an immense amount of information
you get from the eyes, but it's the pairing of what's going on in the
eyes, with everything else going on, the body language, the verbal
content of what's coming out. All that together is the art of
psychiatry and social interaction. But sometimes you don't have the
eye contact. And this is an amazing thing and I do talk about this in
the book as well. In many cases in psychiatry, sometimes it's over the
phone that you have to make key decisions. And as I recall, vividly
being as a resident, very often you have to take these phone calls
from people who are not in the hospital, people you can't see, you
can't see their eyes, you can't see their body or anything about them,
just the sound of their voice. And you can ask them questions, and you
have to make, in some cases, life or death decisions. Is this person
truly suicidal? Something like that, as it comes up all the time. And
so I developed over the course of training, and I think all
psychiatrists do this, is you develop a way that data stream you have,
whether it's the eyes or whether it's just the sound of a voice coming
over the phone, you learn to hone in on that data stream you have and
focus on it and identify changes and it's quite amazing. I found that
you can actually... If you know a patient, you can detect very precise
changes in mood, just from the sound of the voice. And you can have a
realization that oh, this patient's depression has improved by about
half, just by the tone of their voice. And same with eyes, with enough
practice, you can get enough information from a single data stream to
give you some information, but when you do have the whole picture of
that, of course, is best. So, so many theories out there about
excessive blinking and lying, lack of blinking and sociopathy. I like
to remind people that people have varying degrees of lubrication of
the eyes, [Karl laughs] which also influence the frequency of blinking
and presumably have nothing to do with whether or not what they're
saying is true or not. But incredible, nonetheless, that the eyes are
a portal to overall arousal state. I'm fascinated by the effects of
light on circadian biology and just overall desire to be awake or
asleep, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=3964"&gt;Controlling Structures Deep In the Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the eyes are on the outside of the cranial vault. The vagus is
outside the cranial vault, obviously. What about the goodies in here?
Parkinson's, we know at least one of the major sites of degeneration
and failure that lead to those symptoms. I can name off any number of
other things. In your book, you talk about the beautiful work done
with optogenetics of active versus passive coping, that there are
areas of the brain like the habenula that when active, make animals
and presumably people, passive and unwilling, or uninterested in
fighting back against pressures of life, whereas another region, the
raphe, you stimulate that, and they actively cope. They get their grit
going, and they are able to lean into life. So, how does one get to
those structures in a focused way? And what does the next two to five,
to 10 years look like? Well, this is the promise on that, and it is on
a timescale that I think things may start to play out. The specificity
of optogenetics is really only useful if you have some idea of how to
use that specificity. And actually, it's a frustrating aspect of
psychiatry that in many cases, the most effective treatments we have,
have the least specificity, electroconvulsive therapy being a great
example, where you're causing a brainwide Which looks barbaric, but as
you mentioned is effective. I mean, it is. These days, it's much more
clinically safe It doesn't look like one fluid there last seen in the
lab [indistinct] - No it doesn't. Now it's a very clinically safe and
stable procedure, but I would say yeah, it's got this almost medieval
lack of specificity, even if the procedure is well-controlled and
clinically safe and stable, and it's not very specific. You're causing
a brainwide seizure. How could you be less specific than that? And we
don't know the source of the relief. [Karl] We don't know Presumably
it's a dump of neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin, but we
don't really know There certainly is a dump of neuromodulators. We
don't know that that's the cause for the relief. And likewise with
medications, this is an awesome and interesting thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=4103"&gt;The Most Effective Drugs Often Have the Most Side Effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most effective antidepressants, some of the most effective
anti-psychotics are the ones that have the most side effects and there
are many examples of this. For example, the most effective anti-
psychotic is something called clozapine, which unquestionably has the
most side effects. It has terrible, terrible side effects. The D4
antagonist? It has basically every receptor. [laughs] Does it really?
Yeah. - Interesting. Yeah, it has prominent serotonin, prominent
muscarinic, certainly acts on dopamine receptors, but it causes blood
cell counts change- [laughs] How do people feel? So if I were
schizophrenic and I was getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera,
and I took clozapine, what could I expect to feel? Well, so you would
notice side effects, and you would notice resolution of symptoms both
and So the voices would go away? Yeah. But in a good situation, the
voices would go away? - That's right. But I would feel not good in my
body? You might have dizziness, you might have drooling, you might
have any number of physical sensations that would be due to these off
target effects, the medication acting on these other receptors I'm
certainly not suggesting this, but what if somebody without
schizophrenia took clozapine? They'd have the same side effects
presumably, yeah. And so it would not be something that I would
recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=4190"&gt;Do Psychiatrists Take the Drugs They Prescribe?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Do psychiatrists take the drugs that they prescribe? [Karl
laughs] I just finished for the third time, Oliver Sacks'
autobiography which is marvelous and I highly recommend to people. He
certainly took a lot of drugs, not as part of his professional role,
but just out of curiosity, what is the interest or kind of role of
drugs in the field of psychiatry? Because I would imagine for a group
of very curious introspective people who are making recommendations
about what to take, there could actually be some benefit for
understanding what the experience of those drugs was like for their
patients. I think that's true. And I will say that probably many or
most psychiatrists have sampled the number of these for exactly the
reason that you're saying is to understand better and to help treat
their patients better. And I've spoken to people who have found this
very helpful to know, okay, this sleep disruption caused by this
medication or the libido disruption caused by this other medication.
Wow, that is a big effect. And it really helps with empathy for the
patients to understand. I'm not suggesting that physicians or anybody
experiment with drugs, but I am relieved to hear that, because I think
that when you're talking about accessing somebody's mind and their
basic physiology, as you've mentioned, relate to appetite, libido and
sleep, really, one is acting as a mechanic of the person's whole
experience. They walk out of the office and they have a life
experience that extends beyond the script. Yeah. And so at the same
time though, you can't let that completely guide your clinical
decisions, because as I mentioned, some of these medications that have
the most side effects, they are also the most effective and clozapine
is a great example. That will work in patients where nothing else
works. And believe me, we don't take the step of clozapine
prescription lightly, because of all these side effects. You have to
come in for a weekly blood cell, or every few weeks of blood cell
check, to make sure that the blood counts are not off for example, but
there are patients where no other medication works for the
schizophrenia and clozapine works amazingly well That's marvelous. And
so we do it, even though there are the side effects. And so then this
comes back to your question, what if we had better and better
specificity? Well, only if we know exactly what we're doing is the
point. And so because as we become more refined, we'd better be right
about where we we're refining to.. And do you imagine a day where it
will be a single, maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, would go in
through the skull or the back of the ear, deliver a small viral
injection of one of these adenoviruses, a little sticker of light-
emitting diode, deep in the brain, is that how you envision this
someday? That certainly could happen. What I actually prefer as a
vision is still medications, because those are minimally invasive. If
we knew what we were doing, we could make them more specific, have
fewer side effects, but optogenetics, that will arm us with true
causal understanding. And so we'll know, and we're already moving
rapidly toward this point, we'll know okay, this symptom, loss of
pleasure in life that we call anhedonia, or the loss of motivation or
energy to overcome challenges, active coping, these are largely
subserved, largely controlled by this circuit or that circuit or the
cell that inhabits this other circuit. And we will know that because
of the work done with channelopsins? Exactly. - Yeah. I agree. In ways
that we never could have the confidence otherwise. And so we'll know
that this is the circuit that underlies the symptom or its resolution.
And then we'll get to understand these cells very deeply, okay, these
cells that are causal, that do matter, who are they? What's their
wiring? What are the proteins that they make? What are the little
things that are on the surface of the cell that could be receptors for
specific medications or combinations of receptors that would give us
the specificity we need? And then, armed with that causal and precise
and rigorous knowledge, then you can imagine medication development
becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, but truly
grounded in causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=4455"&gt;Moving From Experimental Tools To Novel Treaments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see. So using channelopsins as a way to probe the circuitry and
figure out the sites that are disrupted, what patterns of activity are
required? And then, by understanding the constituents of those cells,
like what they express and what they make, then developing drugs that
could target those cells, not necessarily putting light-inducing
diodes into the brain, or walking around with wire packs attached to
our skull or something like that. [Karl] Right. Exactly. That's
fantastic. And I realized no one has a crystal ball, but what do you
think the arc of that is? Meaning, are we going to see that in a year?
In two years? Three years? Let me reframe that. How soon will a pill-
based treatment for a psychiatric disease be available, that targets a
specific set of cells that we know are important because of the work
done with channelopsins? I think that in some ways it's already
happening at the level of individual patients Here at Stanford? Yeah.
Yup. And more broadly in terms of new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials that will play out over the next few years. And these
could be drugs that are already safe and approved for other purposes,
but we might say okay, now we know that this medication, based on what
we know from causal optogenetics, this could be useful for this other
purpose, this psychiatric symptom. And so the path to helping patients
could be relatively swift. That's very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=4560"&gt;Brain-Machine Interfaces &amp;amp; Neuralink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts about brain machine interface and Neuralink
always comes up, although I do want to point out a tremendous respect
for the folks at Neuralink including someone who came up through my
lab, is now there as a neurosurgeon, but the brain machine interface
is something that's been happening for a long time now, some of the
best work, among the best work being done here at Stanford and
elsewhere too of course, is what you just described compatible with or
different than brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
are going to stimulate different patterns of activity and ensembles of
neurons? And what are your general thoughts about brain machine
interfaces going forward? I mean, first of all, it's an amazing
scientific discovery approach, as you mentioned, we and others here at
Stanford are using electrodes, collecting information from tens of
thousands of neurons In humans, I should add. Yeah. [chuckles] And
even, yes, it is quite even separate from the Neuralink work as you
point out, many people have been doing this in humans, as well as in
non-human primates. And this is pretty powerful, it's important. This
will let us understand what's going on in the brain, in psychiatric
disease and neurological disease, and will give us ideas for
treatment. It is, of course still invasive. You still are talking
about putting a device into the brain. And that has to be treated as a
situation that has some risks, and a step that has to be taken
carefully. I see that as something that will be part of psychiatry in
the long run, already with deep brain stimulation approaches, we can
help people with psychiatric disorders. And that's putting just a
single electrode, not even a complex closed loop system where you're
both playing in and getting information back, even just a single
stimulation electrode in the brain can help people with OCD, for
example, quite powerfully. And that will become much more powerful
when we get to a true brain machine interface, collecting information
back, stimulating only when you need to. If we could identify a
pathological activity pattern, a particular, almost like the prodrome
or the early stage of a seizure, maybe there are events that happened
leading up to on some timescale, a psychiatric symptom that we could
intervene in a closed loop way to detect what's happening, what's
starting to go wrong, feed that back to the brain stimulation
electrode, have it be in that way more efficient and more principled.
I think it's great. It's something that of course will be grounded
again and causal understanding, we'll need to know, what is that
pathological pattern that we're detecting? And we need to know that it
matters. And so again, that's where optogenetics is helping us. It's
helping us know, okay, this pattern of activity in these cells and
these circuits, this does mean that there's a particular kind of
symptom that's happening. But armed with that knowledge, absolutely,
even the simple closed loop device detect and stimulate is going to be
part of psychiatry in the future. And then of course, as you get to
more cells, more connections, the ability that we have to help people
will become more powerful. One of the questions I get asked a lot is
about ADHD and attention deficit of various kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=4770"&gt;ADHD &amp;amp; Dr. Deissroth’s Approach To Focusing His Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a hunch, that one reason I get asked so often is that people
are feeling really distracted and challenged in funneling their
attention and their behavior. And there are number of reasons for
that, of course, but what is true ADHD, and what does it look like?
What can be done for it? And what if any role for channelopsins or
these downstream technologies that you're developing, what do they
offer for people that suffer from ADHD or have a family member that
suffers from ADHD? This is a pretty interesting branch of psychiatry.
There's no question that people have been helped by the treatments,
there's active debate over what fraction of people who have these
symptoms can or should be treated? This is typically Adderall or
stimulants of some kind? Yeah, for example the stimulants, that's
right. So ADHD as its name suggests, it has symptoms of, it can have
either a hyperactive state or an inattentive state, and those can be
completely separate from each other. You could have a patient who
effectively is not hyperactive at all, but can remain focused on
what's going on around them So the body can be still, but their mind
is darting around? That's right. Or they can be very hyperactive with
their body. Yeah, it happens both ways. Probably rarely is somebody
hyperactive with their body but their mind is still, [Karl laughs]
although I have to say, and this is a benevolent shout out to Botond
Rosca, Botond has an incredibly sharp and focused mind. Yeah. And his
hand movements [Karl laughs] are extremely exact also, so I do
sometimes wonder, whether or not our body movements and our head
movements, whether or not they're coordinated or not is a readout of
how directed our attention is. I noticed, I have to think complex,
abstract thoughts. I noticed I have to be very still. So my body has
to be almost completely on moving for me to think very abstractly and
deeply. Other people are different. Some people, when they're running,
they get their best thoughts. I can't even imagine that. My brain does
not work that way at all. I have to be totally motionless, [laughs]
which is kind of interesting. How do you go about that? I sit much
like this, I try to have time in each day where I'm literally sitting
almost in this position, but without distraction and thinking, and so
it's almost meditative in some ways, except it's not true meditation,
but I am thinking, well, I'm not moving You're trying to structure
your thoughts in that time? Yeah. Interesting. - Yeah. So, but
everybody, as you say is very different. And so with ADHD, the key
thing is we want to make sure that this is present across different
domains of life, school and home, to show that it really is a
pervasive pattern, and not something specific to the teacher or the
home situation or something. And then you can help patients. It's
interesting that ADHD is one of those disorders where people are
trying to work on quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, and so there's
some progress toward making a diagnosis looking at particular,
externally detectable brainwave rhythm So skullcap with some
electrodes that don't penetrate the skull? That's right. And this can
be done in an hour or two-hour session? Yeah, that's right. It has to
be done in a clinic, right? Yeah, in the clinic, right, and you have
to have the right recording apparatus and so on, but in principle,
increase in confidence comes in exactly which measurements one could
even imagine moving toward home tests, but we're not there yet.
Amazing. I think one of the reasons I get asked about it so much is a
lot of people wonder if they have ADHD. Do you think that some of the
lifestyle factors that inhabit us all these days, could induce a
subclinical or a clinical-like ADHD? I look at people's phone use
including my own, and I don't think of it like addiction, it looks to
me and feels to me more like OCD. And I'll come clean here by saying
when I was younger, when I was a kid, I had a grunting tic. I used to
hide it. I actually used to hide in the closet, 'cause my dad would
make me stop. And I couldn't feel any relief of my mind until I
[grunts] would do this. And actually now, if I get very tired, if I've
been pushing long hours, it'll come back. Interesting. I was not
treated for it, but I will confess that I've had the experience of, I
always liked sports where I involved a lot of impact, fortunately not
football, because I went to a high school where the football team was
terrible. Maybe that would have avoided more impact, [Karl laughs] but
things like skateboarding, boxing, they bring relief. I feel clarity
after a head hit, which I avoid, [Karl laughs] but I used to say
that's the only time I feel truly clear for a while. And then
eventually it dissipated. By about age 16, 17, it just disappeared. So
I have great empathy for those that feel like there's something
contained in them that won't allow them to focus on what they want to
focus on. And these days, with the phone and all these email, et
cetera, I wonder and I empathize a bit when I hear people saying like,
"I think I might have ADHD or ADD". Do you think it's possible that
our behaviors and our interaction with the sensory world, which is
really what phones and email really are, could induce ADD or
reactivate it? This is a great question. I think about it a lot, and
you mentioned this tic-like behavior in yourself, it's very common
that people who have tics have this building up of something that can
only be relieved by executing the tic which can be a motor movement or
a vocalization or even a thought. And people do, I think these days,
do have this. If they haven't checked their phone in a while, they do
have a buildup and buildup and buildup until they can check it and
relieve it. And there's some similarities, there is a little reward
that comes with the checking. But the key question in all of
psychiatry, what we do is we don't diagnose something unless it's
disrupting what we call social or occupational functioning. Like you
could have any number of symptoms, but literally every psychiatric
diagnosis requires that it has to be disrupting someone's social or
occupational functioning. And these days, checking your phone is
pretty adaptive. That pretty much helps your social and occupational
functioning. And so we can't make [chuckles] it a psychiatric
diagnosis. Interesting. At least in the world of today. Yeah, opting
out of communication now, makes you in some ways less adaptive, though
I would point to you as an example of somebody who is quite good at
managing his interactions, at least from the outsider perspective, I
do want to ask you a little bit about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=5196"&gt;How Dr. Deisseroth Balances A Career In Medicine, Science &amp;amp; Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And first of all, and I realize this is only a partial list, but
you're a clinician, you see patients, you run a big laboratory, how
many people are in your laboratory now? That's a huge laboratory. From
experience, I can say that's an enormous laboratory. You have a family
of five children, and you're happily married to a wonderful colleague
of ours as well, who does incredible work. How do you organize at a
kind of conceptual level, the day and the week? And I should say, what
stress mitigation practices if any, do you incorporate? I've received
emails from you at three in the morning. I sometimes send emails at
three in the morning, but that's when I wake up, maybe I'm depressed,
but I go back to sleep. So, maybe just describe the arc of the blocks
of the day, not hour by hour, necessarily the details of what are in
those blocks, but how do you conceptualize the day? How do you
conceptualize the week? And how do you feel about how that's lined up
with your larger goals of making sure these five young people
flourish? Which I hear they are, but how do you go about this, what
for most people would just be an overwhelming set of items? Well, of
course sometimes it's just take it day by day, and so I don't claim So
you bring the horizon into the unit of the day? I do, I do. The unit
is the day, that's right. And I try to have in each day, as I
mentioned earlier, at least an hour of time where I can think, and it
can be when kids are napping, actually, because while driving I can do
that too, because I'm sitting still, [clears throat] but that's the
one thing I try to preserve. When I was writing the book, I adapted
that time to be my writing time, but it wasn't enough, so I had to add
in a new block of time which was sort of midnight to 2:00 AM, writing
time. [chuckles] And carving out these, even small protected times are
very important. Of course, obligations will expand to fill the time
available and you have to be disciplined. At least I found I had to be
disciplined in truly protecting those times where one can think. So
that means no phone? That means no phone, no checking of the phone.
When I was writing the book, there's a focus mode on the MacBook which
kind of rules the border, and you just have your documents and it's
very pure, and you don't have the temptation of distraction. I'm a big
believer in because the vision and the eyes play such a prominent role
in directing our cognition, something you talk about in the book,
really beautifully, and with a lot of depth and rigor, using visual
tools to harness one's complete mental attention. When you do this
practice of sitting and just thinking, sitting still and thinking, you
said your eyes are open. Are you hearing your own verbal voice,
although in your head? - Yes. So you're actually in conversation with
yourself? Yes. And hearing literally, I mean, not quite literally, I
don't actually hear information, but I'm hearing words, and so I
discovered this about myself. Other people, I think may operate
differently, but I'm extremely verbal in how I think. That's how all
my reasoning is done. It's with sentences and [chuckles] construction
of almost equations with words. Complete sentences? Complete sentences
or complete-ish anyway, mostly complete, and when writing the book,
everything about the writing, every sentence was always played out in
my mind, listening for rhythm and timing, and I would obsess over
exact placement of words to get the right rhythm of the spoken
sentence in my mind. I don't mean to interrupt your flow, but when you
do that, and having experienced this process a bit, although
differently, do you experience any kind of welling up of anxiety when
you're hitting the friction points? And if so, do you have tools or
ways that you quell that anxiety in real time? 'Cause what we're
really talking about here is your mind. But what we're really talking
about is this process of converting the activity of neurons, into
something physically concrete in the world. And these intermediate
steps are so mysterious to everybody. We hear, "Just write the book",
"Just do it", whatever that means. In fact, statements like that to me
are kind of empty and meaningless, but when you hear your voice and
you're trying to find the correct word and you keep hitting, it
doesn't sound quite right, what is the experience in your body? Yeah,
when it's not right, it's definitely evasive, it doesn't feel good,
but there's also a hope because I know I can solve it too, and it's
almost like you're almost there. There's a path that you know is
there, you don't quite see it, but it's there. And I keep that in
mind, and so there's this propulsive force forward because I know that
the solution is there. And that said, there were single words that I
would spend days on, because I was just not happy until I got it
right. And there were some things that I never quite got perfect, and
so I left out of the book entirely because it was so close, but not
quite there. And I was like, no, I can't put that in. Everything you
just said is entirely consistent with my experience of you, [both
laughing] and the way you go about everything. I have to ask, are your
kids writers? Do they like books and words and poetry? I know one of
your children is going on to a career in medicine and science. Yeah.
They're each different which is amazing, yet they all, I think do have
some appreciation or a lot of appreciation for reading, but some are
very musical. Two of the five are extremely musical, very, very
talented with guitar and singing and vocal, impressions, it's just
astonishing. And some of them are great with drawing and artistry and
some are very physical and vigorous and are never happy except when
leaping about. And so, it's just amazing how different they are,
honestly. But I think there is a shared appreciation for language. Do
you think that one can train their mind in using these practices? I
really like your description of the staying physically still and
learning to grapple with those challenges. It's something that,
especially in laboratory science, we aren't really trained to do. Like
many professions we're taught to come in and just get into motion, and
I found that very relaxing as someone who probably has an underlying
tic [Karl chuckles] or something like that, it felt great to be in
motion. One of the hardest things about becoming a university
professor and running a lab, was that I no longer working with my
hands. And it felt like some big important part of my life had been
amputated. But what sorts of practices do you incorporate there? And
do you think people can learn to get better at focusing through a
dedicated practice of the sort that you described? I remember the
rhythms of physical work in the laboratory very well. My work these
days as the laboratory leader, my job has returned mostly to words
now, again. And so it's kind of coming full circle. So it's a
different mode. I think you just have to embrace the different stages
of life, come with the different modes, but you can definitely train
yourself for each mode. I loved, as I mentioned, the rhythm of sewing
and suturing and surgery, and I worked really hard on that and became
good at it. And now, I never do it, but it's what's the next
challenge. There's all the various experimental techniques the
dissections of the brain, I can't tell you how many thousands of brain
dissections I've done in my life, and now I don't do them at all.
[Karl laughs] And then you developed a method so that we don't have to
dissect brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=5741"&gt;New Ways of Exploring Brains: CLARITY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right. [chuckles] - As you mentioned there, maybe tell us for a
moment about clarity, and for people who will probably never set foot
into a laboratory, what an incredible, yet another incredible
discovery and development clarity is, and why it helps us understand
how the brain is structured. Yeah. So this is a different technology
also developed in my lab here, and it's part of a broader approach
that we call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. And what this is, is it's
building a gel, like a clear jello-like substance from within all the
cells of a tissue or even an animal, all at once. So you're
effectively building a gel inside all the cells at once. Now, that's
an odd thing to do. Why do we do it? Well, we do it to transform the
tissue into a more tractable accessible object. And the reason that
works is having built this gel, this new infrastructure inside the
tissue, we can then use chemical tricks, and we can link the molecules
we care about, like proteins or RNAs which are the things, as you
know, right before they become proteins, we can link them, physically
anchor them to this gel, which is a scaffold basically, it's an
interlocking network of polymers. We can link all these interesting
molecules in place, lock them in where they were initially in the
tissue, in the cell, in all the cells. And then we can remove very
vigorously, everything we don't care about that's blocking our light,
that's blocking our molecules, coming in to exchange information with
the tissue. We can get rid of everything else, like the lipids, the
fats, we can effectively use detergents to get them all out, and then
we can see in all the things that were absorbing or scattering light
are gone, you can have a brain that's completely transparent, and yet,
all the interesting molecules are still locked into place there, at
the cellular and sub cellular level. And so this is hydrogel-tissue
chemistry. The first form we described was called clarity. We use that
quite a bit still, but there are many variants now, that we and others
have developed on this basic concept of building this gel within the
tissue and anchoring molecules into place. Literally glass-clear
brains. I've done this, I've taken a brain cleared with this method,
and looked at somebody through it, [Karl laughing] and although you
don't want to get it too close to your eye, you don't want to touch it
to your own eye, and you can see direct all the way through it. [Karl]
Yeah. That's incredible for it raises an important question, which is
again, about the human brain, and as somebody who essentially started
out in neuroanatomy and then got into other things, I always am
bothered by the fact that we actually know very little about the
microstructure of the human brain, compared to the brains of other
organisms. Yeah. And in thinking about understanding the circuitry and
the piano, so to speak and how to manipulate it in order to relieve
suffering,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=5929"&gt;What Is Special About the Human Brain?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one wonders, are the structures in these animal brains and how they
behave, and active coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, those
models, how well they translate to the human condition. Do you think
it's fair to say that there are entire regions of the human brain that
aren't just bigger, but that exist only in the brains of humans?
Especially given that we have this speech, although I do wonder
sometimes if animals report in to each other there. Maybe they have
little psychiatric sessions with one another. You know, I'm always
careful to not assume we do things better. We certainly understand
what we're doing better than we understand what animals are doing, and
they certainly do things better than we do. That said, we do have
amazing, wonderful brains and many structures that are very highly
developed in our brains that are not nearly so developed in mice and
fish for example. Now, that said, when I look at the big picture, what
is the mammalian brain really doing? There are things that you would
never have thought we could study in animals and laboratory mammals
like mice, that it turns out you can, actually, and so I would never
draw the line and say, here's something you can't study in mice, or
here's something that has no parallel in mice. I would be very careful
before making any statement like that. And a good example of that is
we've been able to study just in the past year, come to an
understanding of dissociation, and we had a paper that came out in
late 2020, both mouse and human work, in which we got to the sort of
the circuit basis for dissociation. Now, what is dissociation? A lot
of people might not have experienced it, but it's actually very
common. More than 70% of people who've been through trauma experience
dissociation, it shows up in borderline personality, it shows up in
PTSD. What it is, is a separation of the sense of self, from the body.
So you can have someone who, it's not as if you're numb, you're not
anesthetized. You can still know that something's happening to the
body, but you just don't care, because you don't ascribe it to
yourself, which is very interesting, right? How interesting is that?
The cells report narrative. Yeah. Yeah. In your book, you touch on
this. And I will say is the most precise, and meaningful and eloquent
description of what might be consciousness, this narrative toward the
self or of the self, and where it might reside. So in dissociative
conditions, people are feeling as kind of an absence of a merge
between mind and body. - Right. Is that one way to describe it? That's
right. - And as I recall, this paper involved an exploration of
ketamine. Ketamine was a big part of it. Yeah, that's right. And so
ketamine is another one of those cases where people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine or PCP, we call these the dissociative drugs.
They cause it just like these other psychiatric conditions can cause
it. But we were able to manifest this in mice, administering these
dissociative agents in mice. We could make them still able to detect
stimulus, but not care that it was happening. All the while we were
recording the activity of individual cells in the brain to see what
was going on, what was happening along with this dissociation, and
then use optogenetics to see that it mattered to actually provide that
pattern of activity and see, oh, that actually causes the
dissociation. So we could do all that in mice, which who would've
thought that you could study something like this in mice? And we were
able to go back and forth with human work because here in our Stanford
Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, there's a lot of what we call Stereo
EEG Recording. Patients who come in and in the course of normal
clinical care, they have electrodes recording in their brain to
identify where the seizure is, so they can be candidates for removing
a little patch of the brain that's causing the seizure. This has done
for patients who medications are not helping their seizure disorder.
And there was a patient who had a dissociative state before every
seizure, so this was a human being who was really dissociating, who
could tell us literally as it was happening. And we could see this
pattern, the same pattern that was happening in the mice, in the same
patch of the brain, we could see that happening in the human being at
exactly the right time, in the same patch of the brain that's
homologous across these immense evolutionary distances. And we knew
that it mattered to both the mouse and human because in the human we
could cause it to happen. I just want to underscore the power of
optogenetics and the ability to not just remove a particular
experience or behavior by lesioning or destroying, but then to go back
and actually activate same structure or group of structures and see
the emergences. So essentially, these days you hear a lot about gain
of function research in the context of viral manipulation, but gain of
function is something that we do in the laboratory and you do in
patients, to both take away something and put it back, which gives you
causality. That's right. Yeah, and exactly. And so with optogenetics,
we were able to provide in animals without being on any ketamine or
any drug and we could cause the dissociative state by playing in a
precise pattern of activity. And who would have thought you could do
that? But that was a combined mouse and human paper. Likewise, we've
been able to play in visual sensations into the brains of mice, and by
observing which cells in the visual part of the brain, visual cortex,
are naturally responsive to for example, vertical bars, instead of
horizontal bars in the visual world, we could see which cells were
normally reporting on vertical bars, and then we could use
optogenetics to come and play in activity just to those cells. So
these animals are not viewing anything? Not viewing anything at all.
And we could activate just the vertical bar cells, and not only did
the animal act as if it was seeing a vertical bar, behaviorally, it
was trained to do a particular thing if it saw a vertical bar, and it
did that, just as if it was seeing something visually. But everything
in the brain that we were recording to the internal representation of
this external world was naturalistic too. It looked like the brain was
seeing something visual. So that's gain of function too, you know,
playing in, providing a complex sensation or percept that wasn't there
before. And we can do that across species. So, and of course mice are
social, and they do amazing acts of information processing and I try
not to disparage our cousins too much. They certainly have helped the
field of neuroscience and medicine I should mention, and I know that
people have various sensitivities about animal research, but the work
that's been carried out in mice has been absolutely vital and
instructional for treatment of human disease. That's right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=6363"&gt;Psychedelics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we talked about dissociation and dissociative states rather and
ketamine, I'd love your thoughts on psychedelic medicine. You know, I
sort of half joke having grown up in this area in Northern California
when it was much more counter-culture than it is now, that many of the
things that we're hearing about now, at least from my read of the
history books, happened before. There was a movement aimed at taking
the very same compounds essentially, putting them into patients or
people who were obviously using them recreationally, but putting them
into patients, and seeing tremendous positive effects, but also
tremendous examples of induced psychiatric illness. In other words,
many people lost their minds as a consequence of overuse of
psychedelics. I'll probably lose a few people out there, but I do want
to talk about, what is the state of these compounds? And I realize
it's a huge category of compounds, but LSD and psilocybin, as I
understand trigger activation of particular serotonin receptor
mechanisms, may or may not lead to more widespread activation of the
brain that one wouldn't see otherwise. But when you look at the
clinical and experimental literature, what is your sort of top contour
sense of how effective these tools are going to be for treating
depression? And then if we have the time, we could talk about trauma
and MDMA and some of that work. Well, you're right to highlight both
the opportunity and the parallel that is there. And of course we want
to help patients and of course we want to explore anything that might
be helpful, but we want to do it in a safe and rigorous way. But I do
think we should explore these avenues. These are agents that alter
reality and alter the experience of reality I should say, in
relatively precise ways. They do have problems, they can be addictive,
they can cause lasting change that is not desirable, but we have to
see these as opportunities. We have to first of all, study in the
laboratory, and I'm doing this here. You know we have [chuckles]
big... We have safes with many interesting psychedelics that are all
very carefully regulated. We get inspections from the DEA and so on.
If anyone's hoping to find these labs, [Karl laughing] they exist in
outer space, so you need to be on board one of the SpaceX missions in
order to access them. So don't try and come find them. No, that's
exactly true. Yes. And we're doing exactly this. We're saying this is
an incredible opportunity. If we could understand how the perception
of reality is altered, we could be creating new kinds of intervention
that don't have the risks and the problems of causing lasting change
or addiction. Now, that said, even as these medications exist now, as
you know, there's an impulse to use them in very small doses and to
use them as adjunctive treatments for the therapy of various kinds.
And I'm also supportive of that if done carefully and rigorously, of
course there's risk, but there's risk with many other kinds of
treatments. And I'm not sure that the risks for these medications
vastly outweigh the risks that we normally tolerate in other branches
of medicine. Why would they work? I mean, let's say that indeed their
main effect is to create more connectivity, at least in the moment
between brain areas. So the way I think about the two extremes of my
experience anyways, a high degree of stress and focus for whatever
reason, is going to create changes in my visual field and changes in
the way that I perceive times, so that I'm on a micro-sliced time, I
might be in a very contracted view of whatever my experience is,
whereas on the opposite extreme in a dream or in sleep, space and time
are very fluid, and I'm essentially relaxed, although it might be a
very interesting dream, or it might not be. Psychedelics seemed to be
a trajectory. I'm not too far off from the dream state where space and
time are essentially not as rigid. And there is this element of
synesthesia, blending of the senses, you know, feeling colors and
hearing light and things of that sort. You hear these reports, anyway.
Why would having that dream-like experience somehow relieve
depression, long-term? Do we have any idea why that might be? Yeah. We
have some ideas, and no deep understanding. One way I think about the
psychedelics is they increase our willingness to... They increase the
willingness of our brain to accept unlikely ways of constructing the
world, unlikely hypothesis, as it were, as to what's going on. The
brain, in particular our cortex, I think, is a hypothesis generation
and testing machine. It's coming up with models about everything. It's
got a lot of bits of data coming in, and it's making models and
updating the models and changing them, theories, hypothesis for what's
going on. And some of those never reach our conscious mind. And this
is something I talk about in "Projections" in the book quite a bit, is
many of these are filtered out before they get to our conscious mind,
and that's good. Think how distracted we'd be if we were constantly
having to evaluate all these hypotheses about what kinds of shapes or
objects or processes were out there. And so a lot of this is handled
before it gets to consciousness. What the psychedelics seem to do, is
they change the threshold for us to become aware of these incomplete
hypotheses or wrong hypotheses, or concepts that might be noise but
are just wrong, and so are never allowed to get into our conscious
mind. Now, that's pretty interesting, and it goes wrong in psychiatric
disorders. I think in schizophrenia there's some of the times the
paranoid delusions that people have are examples of these poor models
that escape into the conscious mind and become accepted as reality and
they never should've gotten out there. Now, how could something like
this in the right way, help with something like depression? Patients
with depression often are stuck. They can't look into the future world
of possibilities as effectively. Everything seems hopeless. And what
does that really mean? They discount the value of their own action,
they discount the value of the world at giving rise to a future that
matters. Everything seems to run out like a river just running out
into a desert and drying up, and what these agents may do that
increase the flow through circuitry, if you will, the percolation of
activity through circuitry may end up doing for depression is
increasing the escape of some tendrils of process of forward
progression through the world. That's a concept, that's how I think
about it. There are ways we can make that rigorous. We can indeed
identify in the brain by recording, we can see cells that represent
steps along a path and look into the future, and we can rigorously
define these cells and we can see if these are altered on
psychedelics. And so that's one of the reasons that we're working with
these agents in the laboratory to say, all right, is this really the
case? Are these opening up new paths or representations of paths into
the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=6852"&gt;MDMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDMA, ecstasy is a unique compound in that it leads to big increases
in brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. And I
realized that the neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin often
work in concert, not alone, the way they're commonly described in the
more general popular discussions. However, it is a unique compound,
and it's different than the serotonergic compounds, like LSD and
psilocybin. And there are now data, still emerging that it might be,
and in some cases can be useful for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and
similar things. Why would that work? And a larger question, perhaps
the more important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those
compounds, in my mind there are two components. There's the experience
you have while you're on them, and then there's the effect they have
after. People are generating variations of these compounds that are
non-hallucinatory variations. But, how crucial do you think it is to
have, let's stay with MDMA, the experience of huge levels of dopamine,
huge levels of serotonin, atypical levels of dopamine and serotonin
released, having this highly abnormal experience in order to be normal
again? Yeah. I think the brain learns from those experiences. That's
the way I see it, and so for example, people who have taken MDMA, as
you say, there will be the acute phase of being on the drug and
experiencing this extreme connectedness with other people for example,
and then the drug wears off, but the brain learned from that
experience. And so what people will report is, yeah, I'm not in that
state, but I saw what was possible. I saw it. Yeah. There don't need
to be barriers, or at least not as many barriers as I thought. I can
connect with more people in a way that that is helpful. And so I think
it's the learning that happens in that state, that actually matters.
And as you described that, that sounds a lot like what I understand to
be the hallmark feature of really good psychoanalysis, that the
relationship between patient and therapist, hopefully evolves to the
point where these kinds of tests can be run within the context of that
relationship, and then exported to other relations. Exactly right.
Yeah. And that probably, I'm assuming is still the goal of really good
psychiatry also. As a part of Intimacy, really. It should be. When we
have time, I think all good psychiatrists try to achieve that level of
connection and learning, try to help patients create a new model that
is stable, that is learned, and that can help instruct future
behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=7035"&gt;Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: A Story of Emotions”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I took from reading your book, in addition to
learning so much science and the future of psychiatry and brain
science was, amidst this very tragic cases and sadness, and a lot of
the weight that that puts on the clinician, on you also, that there's
a central cord of optimism, that where we're headed is not just
possible but very likely, and better. Yeah. And, are you an optimist?
[chuckles] I am. And by the way, this was a really interesting
experience in writing "Projections", because I had a dual goal. I
wanted it to be for everybody, literally everybody in the world who
wants to read it. And yet at the same time, I wanted to stay
absolutely rigorously close to the science, what was actually known,
when I was speaking about science. When I was speaking about the
neurobiology of the brain or psychiatry, I wanted to not have any of
my scientific colleagues think, oh, he's going too far, he's saying
too much. And so I had these two goals which I kept on my mind the
entire time. And a lot of this trying to find exactly the right word
we talked about was, on this path of staying excruciatingly rigorous
in the science and yet, letting people see the hope, where things
were, have everybody see that we've come a long way, we have a long
way to go, but the trajectory and the path is beautiful. And so that
was the goal, I think. Of course that sounds almost impossible
[chuckles] to jointly satisfy those two goals, but I kept that in my
mind the whole way through. And yes, I am optimistic and I hope that
it came through in the book It certainly did, and at least from this
colleague, you did achieve both. And it's a wonderful, it's a
masterful book, really, and one that as a scientist and somebody who
is a fellow brain explorer, hits all the marks of rigor and is
incredibly interesting and there's a ton of storytelling. I don't want
to give away too much about it, but people should definitely check out
the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MXqXBZy9U&amp;amp;t=7182"&gt;Connecting with Dr. Deisseroth on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you active on social media? If people want to follow you and
connect with what you're doing now and going forward? Yeah. I have
Twitter. That's where I mainly do exchange, tell people about things
that are happening. We'll provide a link to it, but that's Karl
Deisseroth, as I recall, with a K? That's right. Yeah. - That's right.
And so you're on Twitter, and people will hear this, definitely check
out the book. There are other people in our community that of course
are going to be reaching out on your behalf, but it's incredible that
you juggle this enormous number of things, perhaps even more important
however, is that it's all in service to this larger thing of relieving
suffering. So thank you so much for your time today, for the book, and
the work that [chuckles] went into the book, I can't even imagine,
[Karl laughs] for the laboratory work and the development of
channelopsins, clarity, and all the related technologies and for the
clinical work you're doing and for sharing with us. Well, thank you
for all you're doing in reaching out. I'm very impressed by it. It's
important and it's so valuable, and thank you for taking the time and
for all your gracious words about the book. Thank you. I hope you
enjoyed today's discussion with Dr. Deisseroth as much as I did. Be
sure to check out his new book, "Projections: A Story of Human
Emotions". It's available on Amazon, Audible, and all the other
standard places where books are found. If you'd like to support this

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [gentle music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that
theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first
sponsor is Roka. Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that in my
opinion are the absolute best out there. The sunglasses and eyeglasses
that are made by Roka have a number of properties that are really
unique. First of all, they're extremely lightweight, you never even
notice that they're on your face. Second, the optical clarity is
fantastic. One of the things that's really hard to accomplish, but
that Roka succeeded in accomplishing is making sunglasses that you can
wear in lots of different environments. As you move from bright to
shadowed regions for instance, or as the amount of sunlight changes
many eyeglasses will make it such that it's hard to see your
environment and you need to take the eyeglasses off, or you can't see
or detect borders. With Roka sunglasses, all of that is seamless, they
clearly understand the adaptation mechanisms and habituation
mechanisms, all these fancy details about the human visual system have
allowed them to design a sunglass that allows you to be in any
environment and to see that environment extremely well. The eyeglasses
are terrific, I wear readers at night and again, they just make the
whole experience of reading or working on a screen at night very, very
easy, very easy on the eyes. The aesthetic of the eyeglasses and
sunglasses is also suburb. You know, I chuckle sometimes when I see
sports frames or sports glasses, a lot of them just look ridiculous
frankly, but the Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses have a terrific
aesthetic, they have a huge variety to select from. If you'd like to
try Roka glasses, you can go to Roka, that's roka.com and enter the
code Huberman and you'll get 20% off your first order, that's roka.com

podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and
DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your
health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your
immediate and long-term health can only be detected from a quality
blood test. One of the major problems with blood tests however is that
oftentimes you'll get information back about levels of metabolic
factors, hormones, et cetera, and there won't be any directives about
what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, it makes all of
that very easy. First of all, they can come to your home to do the
blood test and DNA test or you can go to a local clinic, they make
that very easy. Second of all, when you get the information back about
the levels of hormones, and metabolic factors, and other things in
your blood it gives you simple directives. They have a dashboard that
allows you to assess for instance, whether or not you ought to make
changes in your nutrition, or changes in your exercise, or changes in
your sleep regimen, any number of different lifestyle factors that can
help bring the markers and the various factors in your blood and DNA
to the appropriate levels. So, really they're putting you in the
driver's seat for your health. In fact, one of the listeners of this
podcast contacted me recently and said I took an InsideTracker test, I
felt like I was in great health, but I noticed from the test that I
had high CRP, C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein is a marker that
if it's too high is a cautionary note about various cardiac and even
eye diseases, so it's something that they are now taking actions on as
a consequence of getting their blood work done and taking the
InsideTracker test. So, I think that's just one of many examples that
we hear about. I have examples from my own life for instance of
different factors in my blood being off and making adjustments to
nutrition and other aspects of my life that have allowed me to bring
those into the proper range. So, if you care about your health
InsideTracker may very well be right for you. If you'd like to try
InsideTracker you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do
that, you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans, just use the

Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral
probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012 so I'm
delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is
terrific because it covers your nutritional bases. If I drink Athletic
Greens once and I sometimes drink it twice a day, then I'm sure that
all the vitamins I need, I'm getting those. All the minerals I need,
I'm getting those, and the probiotics. There's now a ton of data
showing that a healthy gut microbiome is vital to brain function,
vital to immune function, and vital to all aspects of our health. So
with Athletic Greens, you get the vitamins, the minerals, and the
probiotics to cover all your bases. In fact, anytime people ask me
what should they take or what could they do to support their health,
provided that they already have their sleep and other aspects of their
life in order, Athletic Greens is the thing that I recommend because
it covers all the foundations, all the bases of what one really wants
from a supplement without having to take a ton of different things. It
also tastes great, almost everybody that tries it and then reported
back to me has told me that they really liked the taste. I mix mine
with water, a little bit of lemon and lime juice, and I really like
the taste, it's delicious to me. I drink it once or twice a day. It's
keto compatible, it's compatible with most fasting regimens, it's
compatible with if you're a vegan or if you're not vegan, it's
compatible with essentially every nutritional plan out there, so it's
just a terrific all around supplement and benefit to one's health and
diet. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll claim a
special offer, they'll give you five free travel packs that make it
easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, and they'll
give you a year supply of vitamin D3, K2. Again, go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim that special offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=362"&gt;Sensing Chemicals: Smell, Taste &amp;amp; Chemicals That People Make To Control Each Other&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, we've been talking about the senses, how we detect things
in our environment. The last episode was all about vision, how we take
light and convert that information into things that we can perceive
like colors, and faces, and motion, things of that sort as well as how
we use light to change our biology in ways that are subconscious that
we don't realize, things like mood, and metabolism, and levels of
alertness. Today, we're going to talk about chemical sensing, we're
going to talk about the sense of smell, our ability to detect odors in
our environment. We're also going to talk about taste, our ability to
detect chemicals and make sense of chemicals that are put in our mouth
and into our digestive tract. And we are going to talk about chemicals
that are made by other human beings that powerfully modulator the way
that we feel, our hormones, and our health. Now, that last category
are sometimes called pheromones. However, whether or not pheromones
exist in humans is rather controversial, there actually hasn't been a
clear example of a true human pheromonal effect, but what is
absolutely clear, what is undeniable is that there are chemicals that
human beings make and release in things like tears onto our skin, and
sweat, and even breath that powerfully modulate or control the biology
of other individuals. In fact right now, even if you're completely
alone, your chemical environment internally is being controlled by
external chemicals, your nervous system, and your hormones, and your
metabolism are being modified by things in your environment, so we're
going to talk about those. It's an absolutely fascinating aspect to
our biology, it's one of our most primordial, meaning primitive
aspects of our biology, but it's still very active in all of us today.
This episode, believe it or not, will have a lot of tools, a lot of
protocols. Even though I'm guessing most of you can probably smell
your environment just fine, that you know what you like to eat and
what tastes good, and what doesn't taste good to you, today's episode
is going to talk about tools that will allow you to actually leverage
these chemical sensing mechanisms, including how you smell not how you
smell in the qualitative sense, but how you smell in the verb sense,
the action of sniffing and smelling to enhance your sense of smell and
to enhance your sense of taste as well, believe it or not, to enhance
your cognition, your ability to learn and remember things. Everything
we're going to talk about as always is grounded in quality peer-
reviewed studies from some excellent laboratories, I'll provide some
resources along the way, so that means tools and protocols and also
basic information. You're going to learn a ton of neuroscience and lot
of biology in general. And I think what you'll come to realize by the
end is that while we are clearly different from the other animals,
there are aspects to our biology that are very similar to that of
other animals in very interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=550"&gt;Vision Protocols Recap (Brief) &amp;amp; Correction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into chemical sensing, I want to just briefly touch on
a few things from the vision episode. One is a summary of a protocol.
So, I covered 13 protocols last episode, if you haven't seen that
episode, check it out. Those protocols will allow you to be more alert
and to see better over time if you follow them. All of them are zero
cost, you can find any and all of them at hubermanlab.com, there's a
link to those videos and tools and protocols, everything is
timestamped. The two protocols that I just want to remind everybody of
are the protocol of near-far viewing that all of us regardless of age,
should probably spend about five minutes three times a week, doing
some near-far viewing exercises. So, that would be bringing a pen or
pencil up close to the point where you're about to cross your eyes,
but you don't cross your eyes and then out at some distance. And then
look beyond that pen or other object that you're using off as far as
you can into the distance. It would be great if you could do this on a
balcony or deck and then look way off in the distance and then bring
it back in. This is going to exercise that accommodation reflex, the
change in the shape of the lens can help offset a number of things
including myopia, near-sightedness. The other one is this incredible
study that showed that two hours a day outside, even if you're doing
other things while you're outside can help offset myopia,
nearsightedness. So, try and get outside, it's really the sunlight and
the blue light, right? Everyone's been demonizing blue light out
there, but blue light is great provided it's not super, super bright
and really close to your eyes. Blue is terrific if it comes from
sunlight. Two hours a day outside is going to help offset myopia,
nearsightedness. Now, that's a lot of time, I think most of us are not
getting that time, but since you can do other things like gardening,
or reading, or walking, or running. If you can get that two hours
outside your visual system and your brain will benefit. I also would
like to make one brief correction to something that I said incorrectly
in the previous episode. At the end of the episode, I talked about
lutein, and how lutein may help offset some moderate to severe age-
related macular degeneration. As well, I talked about how some people
are supplementing with lutein even though they don't have age-related
macular degeneration with the idea in mind that it might help offset
some vision loss as they get older. I said lutein, and lutein was the
correct thing to say, but once or twice, when I started speaking fast
I said leucine and not lutein. I want to emphasize that leucine, an
amino acid, very interesting, important for muscle building covered in
previous episodes, but lutein, L-U-T-E-I-N, is the molecule and
compound that I was referring to in terms of supplementing for sake of
vision. So I apologize, please forgive me I misspoke, a couple of you
caught that right away, in listening to the episode after it went up I
realized that I had misspoken. So, lutein for vision, leucine for
muscles, and muscle growth, and strength, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=740"&gt;Color Vision: Excellent Resource: What is Color? (The Book)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the content of today's episode, I want to just
briefly touch on color vision. Many of you asked questions about color
vision and color perception. And indeed color perception is a
fascinating aspect of the human visual system, it's one of the things
that makes us unique. There are certainly other animals out there that
can detect all the colors of the rainbow, some can even detect into
the infrared, into the far-red that we can't see, but nonetheless,
human color vision, provided that somebody isn't colorblind, is really
remarkable. And if you're interested in color vision or you want to
answer questions about art or about for instance why that dress that
showed up online a few years ago looks blue to you and yellow to
somebody else. All the answers to that are in this terrific book which
is "What Is Color?: 50 Questions and Answers on the Science of Color".
I did not write this book, I wish I had, the book is by Arielle and
Joann Eckstut, that E-C-K-S-T-U-T. So, it's "What Is Color?: 50
Questions and Answers on the Science of Color". It's an absolutely
fabulous book, I've no business relationship to them. I did help them
get in contact with some color vision scientists when they reached out
to me. And you can know that all the information in the book was
vetted by excellent color vision scientists. It's a really wonderful
and beautiful book, the illustrations are beautiful. If you're
somebody who's interested in design or art, or you're just curious
about the science of color, it's a terrific book, I highly recommend
it. If you just look it up online, there are a variety of places that
will allow you to access the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=834"&gt;How We Sense Chemicals: Enter Our Nose, Mouth, Eyes, Skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's talk about sensing chemicals and how chemicals control us.
In our environment, there are a lot of different physical stimuli.
There is light, photons, which are light energy and those land on your
retinas and your retinas tell your brain about them, and your brain
creates this thing we call vision. There are sound waves, literally
particles moving through the air and reverberations that create what
we call sound and hearing. And of course there are mechanical stimuli,
pressure, light touch, scratch, tickle, et cetera, that lands on our
skin or the blowing of a breeze that deflects the hairs on our skin,
and we can sense mechanical touch, mechanical sensation. And there are
chemicals, there are things floating around in the environment which
we call volatile chemicals. So, volatile sounds oftentimes like
emotionally volatile, but it just means that they're floating around
out there. So, when you actually smell something like let's say you
smell a wonderfully smelling rose or cake. Yes, you are inhaling the
particles into your nose, they're literally little particles of those
chemicals are going up into your nose and being detected by your
brain. Also, if you smell something putrid, disgusting, or awful, use
your imagination, those particles are going up into your nose and
being detected by neurons that are part of your brain. Other ways of
getting chemicals into our system is by putting them in our mouth, by
literally taking foods and chewing them, or sucking on them and
breaking them down into their component parts, and that's one way that
we sense chemicals with this thing, our tongue. And there are
chemicals that can enter through other mucosal linings and other kind
of just think damp, sticky linings of your body. And the main ones
would be the eyes, so you've got your nose, your eyes and your mouth.
But mainly when we have chemicals coming into our system it's through
our nose or through our mouth. Although, sometimes through our skin
certain things can go transdermal, not many, and through our eyes. So
these chemicals, we sometimes bring into our body, into our biology,
through deliberate action. We select a food, we chew that food, and we
do it intentionally. Sometimes they're coming into our body through
non-deliberate action. We enter an environment, and there's smoke and
we smell the smoke, and as a consequence we take action. Sometimes we
are forced to eat something because somebody tells us we should eat it
or we do it to be polite. So, there are all these ways that chemicals
can make it into our body. Sometimes however, other people are
actively making chemicals with their body, typically this would be
with their breath, with their tears, or possibly, I want to underscore
possibly, by making what are called pheromones, molecules that they
release into the environment typically through the breath that enter
our system through our nose, or our eyes, or our mouth that
fundamentally change our biology. I will explain how smell and taste
and these pheromone effects work, but I'll just give an example, which
is a very salient and interesting one that was published about 10
years ago in the Journal Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=1048"&gt;The Chemicals From Other People’s Tears Lower Testosterone &amp;amp; Libido&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Magazine is one of the three what we call apex journals. There
are a lot of journals out there, but for those of you that want to
know, Science Magazine, Nature Magazine, and Cell are considered the
three top kind of apex journals, they are the most stringent in terms
of getting papers accepted, they're even reviewed there. They have
about a 95% rejection rate at the front gate, meaning they don't even
review 95% of what gets sent to them. Of the things that they do
decide to review then get sent out, a very small percentage of those
get published, it's very stringent. This paper came out in Science
showing that humans, men in particular in this study, have a strong
biological response and hormonal response to the tears of women. What
they did is they had women, and in this case it was only women for
whatever reason, cry and they collected their tears. Then those tears
were smelled by male subjects, or male subjects got what was
essentially the control, which was the saline. Men that smelled these
tears that were evoked by sadness had a reduction in their
testosterone levels that was significant. They also had a reduction in
brain areas that were associated with sexual arousal. Now, before you
run off with your interpretations about what this means and criticize
the study for any variety of reasons, let's just take a step back. I
will criticize the study for a variety of reasons too. One is that
they only used female tiers and male subjects, so it would have been
nice for them to also use female tears and female subjects smelling
those, male tears and male subjects smelling those, male tears and
female subjects smelling those, and so on. They didn't do that, they
did have a large number of subjects, so that's good, that adds power
to the study. And they did have to collect these tears by having the
women watch what was essentially a sad scene from a movie. They
actually recruited subjects that had a high propensity for crying at
sad movies, which was not all women. It turns out that the people that
they recruited for the study were people who said, "Yes, I tend to cry
when I see sad things in movies." What they're really trying to do is
get just get tears that were authentically cried in response to
sadness, as opposed to putting some irritant in the eye and collecting
tears that were evoked by something else like just having the eyes
irritated. Nonetheless, what this study illustrates is that there are
chemicals in tears that are evoking or changing the biology of other
individuals. Now, most of us don't think about sniffing or smelling
other people's tears, but you can imagine how in close couples, or in
family members, or even close friendships, et cetera, that we are
often in close proximity to other people's tears. Now, I didn't select
this study as an example because I want to focus on the effects of
tears on hormones, per se, although I do find the results really
interesting. I chose it because I wanted to just emphasize or
underscore the fact that chemicals that are made by other individuals
are powerfully modulating our internal state, and that's something
that most of us don't appreciate. I think most of us can appreciate
the fact that if we smell something putrid, we tend to retract, or if
we smell something delicious, we tend to lean into it. But there are
all these ways in which chemicals are affecting our biology, and
interpersonal communication using chemicals is not something that we
hear that often about, but it's super interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=1276"&gt;SMELL: Sniffing, A Piece of Your Brain In Your Nose, 3 Responses To Smells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's talk about smell and what smell is and how it works. I'm
going to make this very basic, but I am going to touch on some of the
core elements of the neurobiology. So, here's how smell works. Smell
starts with sniffing. Now, that may come as no surprise, but no
volatile chemicals can enter our nose unless we inhale them. If our
nose is occluded, or if we're actively exhaling it's much more
difficult for smells to enter our nose, which is why people cover
their nose when something smells bad. Now, the way that these volatile
odors come into the nose is interesting. The nose has a mucosal
lining, mucus that is designed to trap things, to actually bring
things in and get stuck there. At the base of your brain, so you could
actually imagine this or if you wanted, you could touch the roof of
your mouth. So, right above the roof of the mouth, about two
centimeters is your olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulb is a collection
of neurons and those neurons actually extend out of the skull, out of
your skull into your nose into the mucosal lining. So, what this means
in kind of a literal sense is that you have neurons that extend their
little dendrites and axon-like things, they're little processes as we
call them, out into the mucus, and they respond to different odorant
compounds. Now, the olfactory neurons also send a branch deeper into
the brain and they split off into three different paths. So, one path
is for what we call innate odor responses, so you have some hard wired
aspects to the way that you smell the world that were there from the
day you were born and that will be there until the day you die. These
are the pathways and the neurons that respond to things like smoke,
which as you can imagine there's a highly adaptive function to being
able to detect burning things because burning things generally means
lack of safety or impending threat of some kind. It calls for action,
and indeed these neurons project to the central area of the brain
called the amygdala, which is often discussed in terms of fear, but
it's really fear and threat detection. So some compounds, some
chemicals in your environment when you smell them, unless you're
trained to overcome them because you're a firefighter you will
naturally have a heightened level of alertness, you will sense threat,
and if you're in sleep, even it will wake you up. All right, so that's
a good thing, it's kind of an emergency system. You also have neurons
in your nose that respond to odorants or combinations of odorants that
evoke a sense of desire and what we call appetitive behaviors,
approach behaviors, that make you want to move toward something. So,
when you smell a delicious cookie, or some dish that's really savory
that you really like, or a wonderful orange, and you say, "Mmm," or it
feels delicious, or it smells delicious that's because of these innate
pathway, these pathways that require no learning whatsoever. Now, some
of the pathways from the nose, these olfactory neurons into the brain
are involved in learned associations with odors. Many people have this
experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=1480"&gt;Smells &amp;amp; Memory: Why They Are So Powerfully Associated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that they can remember the smell of their grandmother's home, or their
grandmother's hands even, or the smell of particular items baking, or
on the stove in a particular environment. Typically, these memories
tend to be of a kind of nurturing sort of feeling safe and protected.
But one of the reasons why olfaction smell is so closely tied to
memory is because olfaction is the most ancient sense that we have, or
I should say chemical sensing is among the most primitive and ancient
senses that we have, probably almost certainly evolved before vision
and before hearing. But when we come into the world because we're
still learning about the statistics of life about who's friendly and
who's not friendly, and where's a fun place to be and where's a boring
place to be, that all takes a long time to learn. But the olfactory
system seems to imprint, seems to lay down memories very early and
create these very powerful associations. And if you think about it
long enough and hard enough many of you can probably realize that
there are certain smells that evoke a memory of a particular place, or
person, or context. And that's because you also have pathways out of
the nose that are not for innate behaviors like cringing, or
repulsion, or gagging, or for that appetitive mmm sensation, but that
just remind you of a place, or a thing, or a context, could be flowers
in spring, could be grandmother's home and cookies. This is a very
common occurrence, and it's a very common occurrence because this
generally exists in all of us. So, we have pathway for innate
responses and a pathway for learned responses. And then we have this
other pathway, and in humans it's a little bit controversial as to
whether or not it sits truly separate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=1600"&gt;Pheromone Effects: Spontaneous Miscarriage, Males &amp;amp; Timing Female Puberty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the standard olfactory system or whether or not it's its own
system embedded in there, but that they call the accessory olfactory
pathway. Accessory olfactory pathway is what in other animals is
responsible for true pheromone effects. We will talk about true
pheromone effects, but for example in rodents and in some primates,
including mandrills. If you've ever seen a mandrill, they have these
like big beak noses things, you may have seen them at the zoo, look
them up if you haven't seen them already, M-A-N-D-R-I-L-S mandrills,
there are strong pheromone effects. Some of those include things like
if you take a pregnant female rodent or mandrill, you take away the
father that created those fetuses or fetus, and you introduce the
scent of the urine or the fur of a novel male, she will spontaneously
abort or miscarry those fetuses, it's a very powerful effect. In
humans, it's still controversial whether or not anything like that can
happen, but it's a very powerful pheromonal effect in other animals.
Another example of a pheromone effect is called the Vandenbergh effect
named after the person who discovered this effect, where you take a
female of a given species that has not entered puberty, you expose her
to the scent or the urine from a sexually competent, meaning post-
pubertal male, and she spontaneously goes into puberty earlier. So,
something about the scent triggers something through this accessory
olfactory system, this is a true pheromonal effect and creates
ovulation, right and menstruation. Or in rodents it's an estrous
cycle, not a menstrual cycle. So, this is not to say that the exact
same things happen in humans. In humans, as I mentioned earlier, there
are chemical sensing between individuals that may be independent of
the nose. And we will talk about those, but those are basically the
three paths by which smells, odors impact us. So, I want to talk about
the act of smelling, and if you are not somebody who is very
interested in smell,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=1736"&gt;Sniffing Creates Alertness &amp;amp; If Done Properly Can Help You Focus &amp;amp; Learn Better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you are somebody who is interested in making your brain work
better, learning faster, remembering more things, this next little
segment is for you because it turns out that how you smell, meaning
the act of smelling, not how good or bad you smell, but the act of
smelling, sniffing, and inhalation powerfully impacts how your brain
functions and what you can learn and what you can't learn. Breathing
generally consists of two actions, inhaling and exhaling, and we have
the option of course to do that through our nose or our mouth. I've
talked on previous episodes about the fact that there are great
advantages to being a nasal breather, and there are a great
disadvantages to being a mouth breather. There are excellent books and
data on this, there's the recent book "Breath" by James Nestor, which
is an excellent book that describes some of the positive effects of
nasal breathing as well as other breathing practices. There's also the
book "Jaws" by my colleagues, Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn, with a
foreword by Jared Diamond and an introduction by Robert Sapolsky from
Stanford. So, that's a book chockablock with heavy hitter authors that
describes how being a nasal breather is beneficial for jaw structure,
for immune system function, et cetera Breathing in through your nose,
sniffing actually has positive effects on the way that you can acquire
and remember information. Noam Sobel's group originally at UC Berkeley
and then at the Weizmann Institute has published a number of papers
that I'd like to discuss today. One of them, Human Non-Olfactory
Cognition Phase-Locked with Inhalation, this was published in Nature
Human Behavior, an excellent journal. Showed that the act of inhaling
[Andrew inhales deeply] has a couple of interesting and powerful
consequences. First of all, as we inhale the brain increases in
arousal, our level of alertness and attention increases when we inhale
as compared to when we exhale. Now, of course with every inhale,
there's an exhale, you could probably double up on your inhales if
you're doing size or something, physiological size I've talked about
these before, so double inhales [inhales twice] followed by an exhale
[exhales], something like that. Or if you're speaking, you're going to
change your cadence and ratio of inhales and exhales, but typically we
inhale, then we exhale. As we inhale, what this paper shows is that
the level of alertness goes up in the brain, and this makes sense
because as the most primitive and primordial sense by which we
interact with our environment and bring chemicals into our system and
detect our environment, inhaling is a cue for the rest of the brain to
essentially to pay attention to what's happening, not just to the
odors as the name of this paper suggests, Human Non-Olfactory
Cognition Phase-Locked with Inhalation. What that means is that the
act of inhaling itself wakes up the brain, it's not about what you're
perceiving or what you're smelling. And indeed sniffing as an action,
inhaling as an action has a powerful effect on your ability to be
alert, your ability to attend, to focus, and your ability to remember
information. When we exhale, the brain goes through a subtle, but
nonetheless significant dip in level of arousal and ability to learn.
So, what does this mean? How should you use this knowledge? Well, you
could imagine, and I think this will be beneficial for most people to
focus on nasal breathing while doing any kind of focused work that
doesn't require that you speak, or eat, or ingest something. There's a
separate paper published in the journal of neuroscience that showed
that indeed if subjects, human subjects, are restricted to breathing
through their nose, they learn better than if they have the option of
breathing through their mouth, or a combination of their nose and
mouth. These are significant effects in humans using modern techniques
from excellent groups. So, sniffing itself is a powerful modulator of
our cognition and our ability to learn. You can imagine all sorts of
ways that you might apply that as a tool. And I suggest that you play
with it a bit that if you're having a hard time staying awake and
alert, you're having a hard time remembering information, you feel
like you have a kind of attention deficit, nonclinical of course,
nasal breathing ought to help, extending or making your inhales more
intense ought to help. Now, this isn't really about chemical sensing
per se, but here's where it gets interesting and exciting. If you are
somebody who doesn't have a very good sense of smell, or you're
somebody who simply wants to get better at smelling and tasting
things, you can actually practice sniffing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=2040"&gt;Protocol 1: Sniffing (Nothing) 10-15X Enhances Your Ability to Smell &amp;amp; Taste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that sounds ridiculous, but it turns out that simply sniffing
nothing. So, doing something like this. [Andrew sniffs deeply] I guess
the microphone sort of has a smell [sniffs], I guess my pen doesn't
have a smell. [Andrew sniffs deeply] It turns out that doing a series
of inhales, and of course each one is followed by an exhale, 10 or 15
times and then smelling an object like an orange or another item of
food, or even the skin of somebody else will lead to an increase in
your ability to perceive those odors. Now, there are probably two
reasons for that. One reason is that the brain systems of detecting
things are waking up as a mere consequence of inhaling. Okay, so this
is sort of the olfactory equivalent of opening your eyes wider in
order to see, more or less. Okay, last episode I talked about how
opening your eyes wider actually increases your level of alertness,
it's not just that your level of alertness causes your eyes to be open
wider. Opening your eyes wider can actually increase your level of
alertness. Well, it turns out that breathing more deeply through the
nose, wakes up your brain and it creates a heightened sensitivity of
the neurons that relate to smell. And there's a close crossover, I'm
sure you know this, between smell and taste. If any of you have ever
had a cold or you have for whatever reason you've lost your sense of
smell, you become what they call anosmic, your sense of taste suffers
also. We'll talk a little bit more about why that is in a few minutes,
but as a first protocol, I'd really like all of you to consider
becoming nasal breathers while you're trying to learn, while you're
trying to listen, while you're trying to wake up your brain in any way
and learn and retain information, this is a powerful tool. Now, there
are other ways to wake up your brain more as well. For instance, the
use of smelling salts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=2150"&gt;Smelling Salts, Ammonia &amp;amp; Adrenaline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not recommending that you do this necessarily, but there are
excellent peer reviewed data showing that indeed, if you use smelling
salts, which are mostly of the sort that include ammonia, ammonia is a
very toxic scent, but it's toxic in a way that triggers this innate
pathway, the pathway from the nose to the amygdala, and wakes up the
brain and body in a major way. This is why they use smelling salts
when people pass out, this is why fighters used to use or maybe
sometimes still use smelling salts in order to heighten their level of
alertness, this is why powerlifters will inhale smelling salts. They
work because they trigger the fear and kind of overall arousal systems
of the brain, this is why I think most people probably shouldn't use
ammonia or smelling salts to try and wake up, but they really do work.
If you've ever smelled smelling salts and I have, I tried this, they
give you a serious jolt, it's like six espresso infused into your
bloodstream all at once, you are wide awake immediately and you feel a
heightened sense of kind of desire to move because you release
adrenaline into your body. Now, inhaling through your nose and doing
nasal breathing is not going to do that, it's going to be a more
subtle version of waking up your system of alerting your brain
overall. And for those of you that are interested in having a richer,
a more deep connection to the things that you smell and taste,
including other individuals perhaps not just food, practicing or
enhancing your sense of sniffing, your ability to sniff might sound
like a kind of ridiculous protocol, but it's actually a kind of fun
and cool experiment that you can do. You just do the simple experiment
of taking for instance an orange, you smell it, try and gauge your
level of perception of how orange-ish it smells, or lemony, lemonish,
lemony, I don't know is it lemonish or lemony? Lemony it smells, then
set it away, do 10 or 15 inhales [Andrew inhales and exhales] followed
by exhales of course, or just through the nose. [Andrew breaths
rapidly] I'm not going to do all 10 or 15. And then smell it again,
and you'll notice that your perception of that smell, the kind of
richness of that smell will be significantly increased. And that's
again, for two reasons, one, the brain is in a position to respond to
it better, your brain has been aroused by the mere act of sniffing,
but also the neurons that respond to that lemon odor, that lemony or
odor are going to respond better. So, you can actually have a
heightened experience of something, and that of course will also be
true for the taste system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=2305"&gt;How You Can Become A Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, &amp;amp; Tasting Better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also can really train your sense of smell to get much, much
better. When Noam Sobel's group was at Berkeley I happened to be a
graduate student around that time, and every once in a while I'd look
outside and there would be people crawling around on the grass with
goggles on, gloves on, and these hoods on with earmuffs. And they
looked ridiculous, but what they were doing is they were actually
learning to follow scent trails. So, in the world of dogs you have
sight hounds that use their eyes in order to navigate and find things,
and you have scent towns that use their nose. And the scent hounds are
remarkable, they can be trained to detect a scent. These are the
sniffing, you know, the bomb sniffing and the drug sniffing dogs in
airports. There are now dogs actually that can sniff out COVID
infections with a very high degree of accuracy, they can be trained to
do that. There's something about the COVID and similar infections that
the body produces probably in the immune response, some odors and the
dogs are I think as high as 90% in some cases, maybe even 95%
accuracy, just remarkable. There are theories that dogs can sniff out
cancer, this stuff all exceeds statistical significance. It's still a
little bit mysterious in some ways, but you may not ever achieve the
olfactory capabilities of a scent hound, but what Noam Sobel's lab did
is they had people completely eliminate their visual experience by
having them wear dark glasses or goggles, so they couldn't see, and
they couldn't hear, they couldn't sense anything with their sense of
touch, they had thick gloves on. But they had these masks on where
just their nasal passages were open and people could in a fairly short
amount of time learn to follow a chocolate scent trail on the ground,
which is not something that most people want to do, but what they
showed using brain imaging, et cetera in subsequent studies is that
the human brain, you can learn to really enhance your sense of smell
and become very astute in distinguishing whether or not one particular
odor or combinations of odors is such that it's less than, or more
than a different odor for instance. Now, why would you want to do
this? Well, if you like to eat as much as I do, one of the things that
can really enhance your sense of pleasure from the experience of
ingesting food is to enhance your sense of smell. And if you don't
have a great sense of smell, or if you have a sense of smell that's
really so good that it's always picking up bad odors, we'll talk about
that in a minute. Well, then you might want to tune up your sense of
smell by doing this practice of 10 or 15 breaths, excuse me, sniffs,
not breaths, sniffs and then interacting with some food item or thing
that you're interested in smelling more of. So, these could be the
ingredients that you're cooking with, I really encourage you to try
and really smell them. You sometimes hear this as kind of a
mindfulness practice like ooh, really smell the food, really taste the
food. And we always hear about that as kind of a mindfulness and
presence thing, but you actually can increase the sensitivity of your
olfactory and your taste system by doing this. And it has long-term
effects, that's what's so interesting. This isn't the kind of thing
that you have to do every time you eat. You don't have to be the
weirdo in the restaurant that's like picking up the radish and like
jamming it up your nostrils, please don't do that. You don't have to
necessarily smell everything, although it's nice sometimes to smell
the food that you're about to eat and as you eat it, but it has long-
term effects in terms of your ability to distinguish and discriminate
different types of odors. And these don't even have to be very pungent
foods it turns out, the studies show that doesn't have to be some
really stinky cheese, you know, there are cheese shops that I've
walked into where like I just basically gag, I can't handle it, I just
can't be in there, it just overwhelms me. Other people, they love that
smell. So, you have to tune it to your interest and experience, but I
think even for you fasters out there, everybody eats at some point,
everybody ingests chemicals through their mouth. And one of the ways
that you can powerfully increase your relationship to that experience
and make it much more positive is through just the occasional practice
of 10 or 15 sniffs of nothing, which almost sounds ridiculous like how
could that be? But now, you understand why, it's because of the way
that the sniffing action increases the alertness of the brain as well
as increasing the sensitivity of the system. No other system that I'm
aware of in our body is as amenable to these kinds of behavioral
training shifts and allow them to happen so quickly. I would love to
be able to tell you that just doing 10 or 15 near-far exercises with a
pen or going outside for 10 or 15 seconds each morning is going to
completely change the way that you see the world. But it actually
isn't the case, you actually, it requires more training, a little bit
more effort in the visual system. In the olfactory system, and your
smell system, and in your taste system just the tiniest bit of
training and attention, and sniffing, inhaling can radically change
your relationship to food such that you actually start to feel very
different as a consequence of ingesting those foods as well as
becoming more discerning about which foods you like and which ones you
don't like. And we're going to talk about that because there's a
really wonderful thing that happens when you start developing a
sensitive palate and a sensitive sense of smell in a way that allows
you to guide your eating and smelling decisions, and maybe even
interpersonal decisions about who you spend time with, or mate with,
or whatever, in a way that is really in line with your biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=2625"&gt;Smell As A Readout Of Brain Health &amp;amp; Longevity; Regaining Lost Sense Of Smell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, how well we can smell and taste things is actually a very
strong indication of our brain health. Now, that's not to say that if
you have a poor sense of smell or a poor sense of taste, that you're
somehow brain damaged or you're going to have dementia, although
sometimes early signs of dementia or loss of neurons in other regions
of the brain related to say Parkinson's can show up first as a loss of
sense of smell. Again, it's not causal, and it's certainly not the
case that every time you have a sudden loss of smell that there's
necessarily brain damage, I want to be very about that, but they are
often correlated. There's also a lot of interest right now in loss of
sense of smell because one of the early detection signs of COVID-19
was a loss of sense of smell. So, I just briefly want to talk about
loss of sense of smell and regaining sense of smell and taste because
these have powerful implications for overall health. And in fact can
indicate something about brain damage and can even inform how quickly
we might be recovering from something like a concussion. So, our
olfactory neurons, these neurons in our nose that detect odors are
really unique among other brain neurons because they get replenished
throughout life, they don't just regenerate, but they get replenished.
So regeneration is when something is damaged and it regrows, these
neurons are constantly turning over throughout our lifespan, they're
constantly being replenished, they're dying off and they're being
replaced by new ones. This is an amazing aspect of our brain that's
basically unique to these neurons, there's one other region of the
brain where there's a little bit of this maybe, but these olfactory
neurons about every three or four weeks they die. And when they die,
they're replaced by new ones that come from a different region of the
brain, a region called the subventricular zone. The name isn't as
important, but as the phenomenon, but these neurons are born in the
ventricle, the area of your brain that's a hole that contains... It's
not an empty hole, it's a hole basically that contains cerebral spinal
fluid. Well, there's a little subventricular zone, there's a little
zone below, sub ventricles. And that zone, if you are exercising
regularly, if your dopamine levels are high enough, those little cells
there are like stem cells. They are stem cells and they spit out what
are called little neuroblasts, those little neuroblasts migrate into
the front of your brain and then shimmy, they kind of move through
what's called the rostral migratory stream. They kind of shimmy along
and land back in your olfactory bulb, settle down and extend little
wires into your olfactory mucosa. This is an ongoing process of what
we call neurogenesis or the birth of new neurons. Now, this is really
interesting because other neurons in your cortex, in your retina, in
your cerebellum, they do not do this, they are not continually
replenished throughout life. But these neurons, these olfactory
neurons are, they are special. And there are a number of things that
seem to increase the amount of olfactory neuron neurogenesis. There is
evidence that exercise, blood flow, can increase olfactory neuron
neurogenesis. Although, those data are fewer in comparison to things
like social interactions, or actually interacting with odorants of
different kinds. So, if you're somebody who doesn't smell things well,
you have a poor sense of smell, your olfactory system doesn't seem
very sensitive, more sniffing, more smelling is going to be good. And
then the molecule dopamine, this neuromodulator, that is associated
with motivation and drive. And in some cases, if it's very, very high
with mania, or if it's very, very low with depression or Parkinson's,
but for most people where dopamine is in essentially normal ranges
dopamine is also a powerful trigger of the establishment of these new
neurons and their migration into the olfactory bulb and your ability
to smell. Now, you don't want to confuse correlation with causation,
so if you're not good at smelling does that mean you have low
dopamine? No, not necessarily. If you have low dopamine, does that
mean that you have a poor sense of smell? No, not necessarily. Some
people who take antidepressants of the sort that impact the dopamine
system strongly like Wellbutrin will report a sudden, meaning within a
couple of days, increase in their ability to smell particular odors,
and it's a very striking effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=2910"&gt;Dopamine, Sense Of Smell, New Neurons &amp;amp; New Relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people when they are in a new relationship because dopamine and
the hormones, testosterone and estrogen are associated with novelty
and the sorts of behaviors that often are associated with new
relationships those three molecules; dopamine, testosterone, and
estrogen kind of work together. And oftentimes people will say or
report when they're newly in love or in a new relationship that
they're just obsessed with, or they just so enjoy the scent of another
person so much so that they like to borrow the other person's clothing
or they'll sniff the other person's clothing or they can even just in
the absence of the person they can imagine their smell and feel a
biological response, something that we'll talk more about. So, these
neurons turnover throughout the lifespan and as we age, we actually
can lose our sense of smell. And it's likely, I want to underscore
likely, that that loss of sense of smell as we age is correlated with
a loss of other neurons in the retina, in the ears, a loss of vision,
loss of hearing, loss of smell, loss of the sense apparati which our
neurons is correlated with aging. So, what we've been talking about
today is the ability to sense these odors, but what I'd like to do is
empower you with tools that will allow you to keep these systems tuned
up. Last time, we talked about tuning up and keeping your visual
system tuned up and healthy regardless of age. Here, we're talking
about really enhancing your olfactory abilities, your taste abilities
as well by interacting a lot with odors, preferably positive odors,
and sniffing more, inhaling more, which almost sounds crazy, but now
you understand why. Even though it might sound crazy it's grounded in
real mechanistic biology of how the brain wakes up and responds to
these chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=3020"&gt;Why Brain Injury Causes Loss Of Smell; Using Smell To Gauge &amp;amp; Speed Recovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, speaking of brain injury, olfactory dysfunction is a common theme
in traumatic brain injury for the following reason, these olfactory
neurons as I mention extend wires into the mucosa of the nose, but
they also extend a wire up into the skull. And they extend up into the
skull through what's called the cribriform plate, it's like a Swiss
cheese type plate where they're going through. And if you get a head
hit, that bone, the cribriform plate, sheers those little wires off
and those neurons die. Now, eventually they'll be replaced, but
there's a phenomenon by which concussion and the severity of
concussion and the recovery from a head injury can actually be gauged
in part, in part, not in whole, but in part by how well or fully one
recovers their sense of smell. So, if you're somebody that
unfortunately has suffered a concussion, your sense of smell is one
readout by which you might evaluate whether or not you're regaining
some of your sensory performance. Of course, there will be others like
balance, and cognition, and sleep, et cetera. But I'd like to refer
you to a really nice paper which is entitled Olfactory Dysfunction in
Traumatic Brain Injury: the Role of Neurogenesis the first author is
Marin, M-A-R-I-N. The paper was published in Current Allergy and
Asthma Report, this is 2020. I spent some time with this paper, it's
quite good, it's a review article, I like reviews if they're peer-
reviewed reviews and in quality journals. And what they discuss is and
I'll just read here briefly 'cause they said it better than I could,
"Olfactory functioning disturbances are common following traumatic
brain injury, TBI, and can have a significant impact on the quality of
life. Although there is no standard treatment for patients with the
loss of smell." Now I'm paraphrasing, "Post-injury olfactory training
has shown promise for beneficial effects. Some of this involves," they
go on to tell us the role of dopamine, dopaminergic signaling, as I
mentioned before, but what does this mean? This means that if you've
had a head injury or repeated head injuries that enhancing your sense
of smell is one way by which you can create new neurons. And now, you
know how to enhance your sense of smell by interacting with things
that have an odor very closely, and by essentially inhaling more,
focusing on the inhale to wake up the brain and to really focus on
some of the nuance of those smells. So, you might do for instance a
smell test by which you smell something like a lemon, put it down, do
10 inhales or so, smell again, et cetera. You might also just take a
more active role in trying to taste and smell your food, and taste and
smell various things. I mean, please don't ingest anything that's
poisonous that you're not supposed to be ingesting, but you know what
I mean, really tuning up this system, I think is an excellent review,
we're going to do an entire episode all about the use of the visual
system in particular, but also the olfactory system for treatment of
traumatic brain injury, as well as other methods. But I wanted to just
mention it here because a number of people asked me about TBI. And
here again, we're in this place where the senses and our ability to
sense these chemicals through these two holes in the front of our
face, our nostrils is a powerful readout and way to control brain
function and nervous system function generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=3213"&gt;Using Smell To Immediately Becoming Physically Stronger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note about the use of smelling salts, I have a feeling
that some of you may be interested in that and its application. If you
are interested in that, I recommend you go to the scientific
literature first rather than straight to some vendor or to the what do
they call it these days? Costello bro science, he says, bro science,
the bro science. You can go to this paper, which is excellent and is
real science, which is Acute Effects of Ammonia Inhalants on Strength
and Power Performance in Trained Men. It's a randomized controlled
trial, it was published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning
Research in 2018, and it should be very easy to find. I will provide a
link to the so-called PubMed ID, which is a string of numbers, and
we'll put that in the caption if you want to go straight to that
article, does show a significant what they call, this is what the
words they use literally in quotes, "psyching up effect through the
use of these ammonia inhalants and a significant increase in maximal
force in force development in a variety of different movements." So,
for those of you that are interested in ammonia inhalants, so-called
smelling salts, that might be a good reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=3280"&gt;Smelling In Our Dreams, Active Sniffing In Sleep, Sniffing As a Sign Of Consciousness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I wanted to talk about with reference to odors is this
myth which is that we don't actually smell things in our dreams, that
we don't have a sense of smell. That's pure fiction, I don't know who
came up with that, it's very clear that we are capable of smelling
things in our sleep. However, when we are in REM sleep, rapid eye
movement sleep, which is the sleep that predominates toward the second
half of the night our ability to wake up in response to odors is
diminished. It's not absent, but it's diminished. If smoke comes into
the room, we will likely wake up if the concentration of smoke is high
enough regardless of the stage of sleep we're in, but in REM sleep we
tend to be less likely to smell, to sniff. And that actually was
measured in a number of studies that sniffing in sleep is possible.
So, if you put an odor like a lemon underneath someone's nostrils in
the early portion of the night, they will smell, and they will
later... They will sniff, excuse me, whether or not they smell or not,
I guess depends on them and when they showered last, but they will
definitely sniff and they will report later, especially if you wake
them up soon after that, they had a dream or a percept of the scent of
a lemon for instance. Later in the night, it's harder for that
relationship to be established, it's likely that because of some of
the paralysis associated with rapid eye movement sleep, which is a
healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, you don't want to act out
your dreams in REM sleep that there is a less active tendency to
sniff. And actually this has real clinical implications, the ability
to sniff in response to the introduction of an odor is actually one
way in which clinicians assess whether or not somebody's brain is so-
called brain dead. That's not a nice term, but brain dead, or whether
or not they have the capacity to recover from things like coma and
other states of deep unconsciousness, or I guess you'd call it
subconsciousness. So, what will happen is if someone has an injury and
they're essentially out cold, the production of a sniffing reflex, or
a sniffing response to say a lemon or some other odor presented below
the nostrils is considered a sign that the brain is capable of waking
up. Now, that's not always the case, but it's one indication. So just
like you could use mechano sensation, so, a toe pinch for instance,
you know, or scraping the bottom of somebody's barefoot to see if
they're conscious, or shining light in their eyes, these are all
things that you've seen in movies and television, or maybe if you've
seen in real life as well. Well, odors and chemical sensing is another
way by which you can assess whether or not the brain is capable of
arousal. And actually olfactory stimulation is one of the more
prominent ones that's being used in various clinics. As a last point
about specific odors and compounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=3455"&gt;Mint Scents Create Alertness By Activating Broad Wake-Up Pathways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that can increase arousal and alertness, and this was simply through
sniffing them not through ingesting them. There are data, believe it
or not, there are good data on peppermint and the smell of peppermint,
minty type sense, whether you like them or not will increase
attention, and they can create the same sort of arousal response
although not as intensely or as dramatically as ammonia salts can for
instance. By the way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, you could
actually damage your olfactory epithelium if you do that too close to
the ammonia. If you're going to use smelling salts be sure you work
with someone or you know what you're getting and how you're using
this. You can damage your olfactory pathway in ways that are pretty
severe, you can also damage your vision. If you've ever teared up
because you inhaled something that was really noxious, that is not a
good thing, it doesn't mean you necessarily cause damage, but it means
that you have irritated the mucosal lining and possibly even the
surfaces of your eyes, so please be very, very careful. Scents like
peppermint, like these ammonia smelling salts, the reason they wake
you up is because they trigger specific olfactory neurons that
communicate with the specific centers of the brain, namely the
amygdala and associated neurocircuitry and pathways that trigger
alertness of the same sort that a cold shower or an ice bath, or a
sudden surprise, or a stressful text message would evoke. Remember,
the systems of your body that produce arousal, and alertness, and
attention, and that cue you for optimal learning, aka focus. Those are
very general mechanisms, they involve very basic molecules like
adrenaline and epinephrin same thing actually, adrenaline and
epinephrin. The number of stimuli, whether it's peppermint or ammonia,
or a loud blast, the number of stimuli that can evoke that adrenaline
response and that wake up response are near infinite. And that's the
beauty of your nervous system, it was designed to take any variety of
different stimuli placed them into categories, and then evoke
different categories of very general responses. Now, you know a lot
about olfaction and how the sense of smell works, here's another
experiment that you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=3588"&gt;Protocol 2 Pleasant Or Putrid: The Microwave Popcorn Test, Cilantro, Asparagus, Musk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll ask you right now. Do you like, hate, or are you indifferent to
the smell of microwave popcorn? Some people, including one member of
my podcast staff says it's absolutely disgusting to them, they feel
like it's completely nauseating. I don't mind it at all, in fact, I
kind of like it. I think the smell of a microwave popcorn is kind of
pleasant. I don't particularly like it, but it's certainly not
unpleasant. Some people have a gene that makes them sensitive to the
smell of things like microwave popcorn such that it smells like vomit.
I probably don't have that gene because I find the smell of microwaved
popcorn pretty pleasant. Some people hate the smell of cilantro, some
people ingest asparagus, and when they urinate they can smell the
asparagus in a very pungent way, other people can't smell it at all.
These are variants in genes that encode for what are called olfactory
receptors. Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene,
one gene that codes for a receptor that responds to a particular odor.
If you don't have that gene you will not respond to that odor. So, the
reason why some people find the smell of microwave popcorn to be very
noxious, putrid in fact, is because they have a gene that allows them
to smell the kind of putrid odor within that. Other people who lack
that gene just simply can't smell it, so we are not all the same with
respect to our sensory experience. What one person finds delicious,
another person might find disgusting. I'll give a good example which
is that I absolutely despise Gorgonzola and blue cheese, absolutely
despise it, it smells and tastes like dirty moldy socks to me. Some
people love it, they crave it, actually, some people get a visceral
response to it, and we will talk about how certain tastes can actually
evoke very deep biological responses, even hormonal responses when we
talk about taste in a few minutes. But there are these odors, for
instance in popcorn it's the molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, not
proline but pyrroline, that gives off to some people like me a toasted
smell as the sugars in the kernels heat, but the compound is also
found in things like white bread and jasmine rice, which don't have as
pungent an odor, but some people smell that and it smells like cat
urine. Now, there are scents like musky scents and musty scents that
are secreted by animals like skunks and other animals of the so-called
Mustelidae family. So, these would be ferrets and other animals that
can spray in response to fear, or if they just want to mark a
territory because they want to say that's mine. Dogs incidentally have
scent glands that they rub on things, cats have them too. This musty
odor, some people find actually quite pleasant, some people find it to
be very noxious and that will depend of course on the concentration,
right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=3780"&gt;Skunks, Costello, All Quiet On The Western Front&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll never forget the first time Costello got sprayed by a skunk and
it was awful. I actually don't mind the smell of skunk at a distance,
it's actually a little bit pleasant, I admit it's a little bit
pleasant to me. I don't think that makes me too weird because if you
ever read the book "All Quiet on the Western Front" about World War I,
there's a description in there about the smell of skunk at a distance
being mildly pleasant, so the author of that book probably shared a
similar olfactory profile to me, or I to them rather, but some people
find even the tiniest bit of the smell of skunk or musk to be noxious
or awful. Now, of course in high concentrations, it's really awful.
And unfortunately, poor Costello, he was like literally red-eyed and
just snorting, and it was awful. There's a joke about dogs that says
that dogs either get skunked one time and never again or 50 or a
hundred times. Costello has been skunked no fewer, I'm not making this
up, has been skunked no fewer than 103 times. And that's because if he
sees something or hears something in the bushes, he just goes straight
in, he does not learn. But if you like this, that musty scent or musky
scent, well that says something about the genes that you express in
your olfactory neurons, it is completely inherited. And if you don't
like that scent, if it's really noxious or you have this response to
microwave popcorn, well, that means you have a different compliment, a
different constellation if you will of genes that make up for these
olfactory sensory neurons and the receptors that they express. Let's
talk about taste. Not whether or not you have taste or you don't have
taste,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=3872"&gt;TASTE: Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Umami, Sour; Your Tongue, Gustatory Nerve, NST, Cortex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there's no way for me to assess that, but rather how we taste things,
meaning how we sense chemicals in food and in drink. There are
essentially five, but scientists now believe there may be six things
that we taste alone or in combination, they are sweet tastes, salty
tastes, bitter tastes, sour tastes, and umami taste. Most of you
probably heard of umami by now, it's U-M-A-M-I. Umami is actually the
name for a particular receptor that you express on your tongue that
detects savory tastes, so it's the kind of thing in braised meats.
Sometimes people can even get the activation of umami by tomatoes or
tomato sauces. What are each of these tastes and taste receptors
responsible for? And then we'll talk about the sixth, maybe you can
guess what it is, I don't know if you can guess it now. I couldn't
guess it, but of the five tastes each one has a specific utility or
function. Each one has a particular group of neurons in your mouth, in
your tongue, believe it or not, that responds to particular chemicals
and particular chemical structures. It is a total myth, complete
fiction, that different parts of your tongue harbor different taste
receptors. You know, that high school textbook diagram that you know
sweet is in one part of the tongue and sour is in another, and bitters
in another, complete fiction, just total fiction related to very old
studies that were performed in a very poorly controlled way, no
serious biologists and certainly no one that works on tastes would
contend that that's the way that the taste receptors are organized,
they are completely intermixed along your tongue. If you have
heightened or decreased sensitivity to one of those five things I
mentioned; sweet, salty, bitter, umami, or sour at one location in
your tongue, it likely reflects the density of overall receptors or
something going on in your brain, but not the differential
distribution of those receptors. So, the sweet receptors are neurons
that express a receptor that respond to sugars, in the same way that
you have cones, photoreceptors, in your eye that respond to short,
medium, or long wavelength light, meaning blueish, greenish, or
reddish light. You have a neuron, or neurons plural, in your tongue
that respond to sugars. And then those neurons, they don't say sweet,
they don't actually send any sugar into the brain, they send what we
call a volley, a barrage of action potentials of electrical signals
off into the brain. It's an amazing system. So, all these receptors in
your tongue make up what are called the neurons that give rise to a
nerve, a collection of wires, nerve bundles of what's called the
gustatory nerve, it goes from the tongue to the so-called nucleus of
the solitary tract. And some of you requested names, I usually don't
like to include too many names for sake of clarity, but the gustatory
nerve from the tongue goes to the nucleus of the solitary tract and
then to the thalamus and to insular cortex. You don't have to remember
any of those names if you don't want to, but if you want mechanism,
you want neural circuits, that's the circuit, gustatory nerve from the
tongue, nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem, then the
thalamus, and then insular cortex. And it is in insular cortex, this
regenerate cortex that we sort out and make sense of and perceive the
various tastes. Now, it's amazing because just taking a little bit of
sugar or something sour like a little bit of lemon juice and touching
it to the tongue within 100 milliseconds, right? Just 100
milliseconds, far less than one second, you can immediately
distinguish ah, that's sour, that sweet, that's bitter, that's umami,
and that's an assessment that's made by the cortex. Now, what to these
different five receptors encode for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=4125"&gt;Energy, Electrolytes, Poisons, Gagging, Amino Acid &amp;amp; Fatty Acid Sensing, Fermentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, but what are they really
looking for? What are they sensing? Well, sweet stuff signals the
presence of energy, of sugars. And while we're all trying or we're
told that we should eat less sugar for a variety of reasons, the
ability to sense whether or not a food has rapid energy source or
could give rise to glucose is essential so we have sweet receptors.
The salty receptors, these neurons are trying to sense whether or not
there are electrolytes in a given food or drink. Electrolytes are
vitally important for the function of our nervous system, and for our
entire body, sodium is what allows neurons to fire. What allows them
to be electrically active. We also need potassium and magnesium, those
are the ions that allow the neurons to be active. So the salty
receptors, the reason that they are there is to make sure that we are
getting enough, but not too much salt, we don't want to ingest things
that are far too salty. Bitter receptors are there to make sure we
don't ingest things that are poisonous. How do I know this? How can I
say that? Even though I was definitely not consulted at the design
phase, how can I say that? Well, the bitter receptors create a what we
call labeled line, a unique trajectory to the neurons of the brainstem
that control the [gags], the gag reflex. If we taste something very
bitter it automatically triggers the gag reflex. Now, some people like
bitter taste, I actually liked the taste of bitter coffee, children
generally like sweet tastes more than bitter tastes, but even babies
if they taste something bitter, they'll just immediately spit it up,
it's like the gag reflex. Putrid smells will also evoke the same
neurons, so some people are very sensitive, they have a very sensitive
or low threshold vomit reflex, you're going to and there was somebody
in my lab early on. And we never did this intentionally, and we're
just laughing 'cause it was so dramatic. How we would have a
discussion, someone would say something about something kind of gross,
appropriate for the workplace, but nonetheless gross, we are
biologists, would say something and they would say, "Stop, stop stop,
I'm going to throw up." You know and some people have a very low
threshold quick gag reflex. Other people don't, other people have a
very stable stomach, they don't, you know, they rarely, if ever vomit.
The umami receptor isn't sensing savory because the body loves savory,
it's because savory is a signal for the presence of amino acids. And
we'll talk more about this, but the presence of amino acids in our gut
and in our digestive system, and the presence of fatty acids is
essential, there is in fact, no essential carbohydrate or sugar. Now,
I'm not a huge proponent of ketogenic diets nor am I against them, I
think it's highly individual, you have to decide what's right for you,
but everybody needs amino acids to survive, the brain needs them and
we need fatty acids, especially to build a healthy brain during
development, you need amino acids and fatty acids. And the sour
receptor, why would we have a sour receptor? So, that we could have
those really like sour candies? I think they've gotten more and more
sour over the years. I admit I don't eat candy much, but I do have a
particular weakness for like a really good really sour like gummy
peach or they if the gummy cherries are dipped in whatever that sour
powder, so I was a kid who I admit it, I liked the LIK-M-AID thing,
I'd like drink the powder. Please don't do this, don't give this
garbage to your kids, but I liked it, it was tasty, but sour receptors
are not there so that you can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches or
something like that, that's not why the system evolved, it's there and
we know it's there to detect the presence of spoiled or fermented
food. Fermented fruit has a sour element to it, and fermented things
while certainly some fermented foods like sauerkraut, and kimchi, and
things of that sort can be very healthy for us and are very healthy in
reducing inflammation, there's great data on that, pro quality
microbiome, et cetera. Fermented fruit can be poisonous, right?
Alcohols are poisonous in many forms to our system and the sour
receptor bearing neurons communicate to an area of the brainstem that
evokes the pucker response, closing of the eyes and essentially
shutting of the mouth, and cringing away. I think cringe is like a
thing now, my niece, whenever I seem to say something or do something
it's either an eye-roll, a cringe, or both in combination. So the
sour, the sweet, the salty, the bitter, and the umami system, were not
there so that we could have this wonderful pallet of foods that we
enjoy so much, they'll allow us to do that, but they're there to make
sure that we bring in certain things to our system and that we don't
ingest other things. Now, what's the sixth sense within the taste
system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=4428"&gt;Our 6th Sense of Taste: FAT Sensing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sixth sense generally, but within the taste system. What's this
putative possible sixth receptor? I already kind of hinted at it when
I talked about fatty acids, there are now data to support the idea
although there's still more work that needs to be done that we also
have receptors on our tongue that sense fat. And that because fat is
so vital for the function of our nervous system and the other organs
of our body that we are sensing the fat content in food, maybe this is
why I can only eat half, but no less than half of a jar of almond
butter or peanut butter in one sitting. I just can't, unless it's not
salted, in which case, it makes no sense to me. But it's remarkable
how that texture, and also the flavor, but that texture of fat. I love
butter, I am guilty, and Costello is definitely guilty of eating pats
of butter from time to time, I have no guilt about this. People eat
pats of cheese, why shouldn't we eat a pat of butter? If you think
that's gross then maybe I have a greater abundance of the fat
receptors in my tongue, maybe I have a fat tongue than you do. But
nonetheless, the ability to sense fat here in our mouth seems to be
critical, you can imagine why that is. I want to talk about the tongue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=4505"&gt;Gut-Brain: Your Mouth As An Extension Of Your Gut; Burned Mouth &amp;amp; Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the mouth as an extension of your digestive tract. I know that
might not be pleasant to think about, but when you look at it through
the lens that I'm about to provide, it will completely change the way
you think about the gut brain and about all the stuff that you've
heard in these recent years about oh, we have this second brain, it's
all these neurons in our gut, I've been chuckling through these last
few years as people have gotten so excited about the gut brain, not
because of their excitement, I think that excitement is wonderful, but
we always knew that the nervous system extended out of the brain and
into the body, and people seem kind of overwhelmed and surprised by
the idea that we have neurons in our gut that can sense things like
sugars and fatty acids. And I think those are beautiful discoveries,
don't get me wrong. Diego Bohorquez's lab out of Duke University has
done beautiful studies showing that within the mucosal lining of our
gut we have neurons that sense fatty acids, sugars, and amino acids,
and that when we ingest something that contains one or two or three of
those things, there's a signal sent via the vagus nerve up into what's
called the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E, and then into the brain where
it secretes dopamine which makes us want more of that thing, it makes
us more motivated to pursue and eat more of that thing, that's either
fatty, or umami, savory, or has a sweet taste, any one or two or three
of those qualities, independent of the taste. Now, I think those are
beautiful data, but we know that this thing, the mouth. And for those
of you listening I've just got my couple of fingers in my mouth,
that's why I sound like I've got something in my mouth. This thing in
the front of our face, we use it for speaking, but it is the front of
our digestive tract. We are essentially a series of tubes and that
tube starts with your mouth and heads down into your stomach. And so,
that you would sense so much of the chemical constituents of the stuff
that you might bring into your body or that you might want to expel
and not swallow or not interact with by being able to smell is it
putrid? Does it smell good? Does it taste good? Is this safe? Is it
salty? Is it so sour that it's fermented and it's going to poison me?
Is it so bitter that it could poison me? Is it so savory that, mmm,
yes. I want more and more of this. Well, then you'd want to trigger
dopamine, that's all starting in the mouth. So, you have to understand
that you were equipped with this amazing chemical sensing apparatus,
we call your mouth and your tongue. And those little bumps on your
tongue that they call the papillae, those are not your taste buds.
Surrounding those little papillae like little rivers are these little
dents and indentations. And what dents and indentations do in a tissue
is they allow more surface area, they allow you to pack more
receptors. So, down in those grooves are where all these little
neurons and their little processes are with these little receptors for
sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, and maybe fat as well. And so, it's
this incredible device that you've been equipped with, that you can
use to interact with various components of the outside world and
decide whether or not you want to bring them in or not. Just as you
can lose those olfactory neurons, if you happen to get hit on the head
or you have some other thing, maybe it was an infection that caused
loss of those olfactory sensory neurons, you can also lose taste
receptors in your mouth. If you've ever eaten something that's too
hot, not spicy hot, but too hot, you burn your tongue, you burn
receptors. It takes about a week to recover those receptors. For some
people it's a little bit more quickly, but if you burn your tongue
badly by ingesting a soup that's too hot or a beverage that's too hot,
you will greatly reduce your sense of taste for essentially all
tastes. And that's because those neurons sit very shallow beneath the
tongue's surface, and so that if you put something too hot on, you
literally just burn those neurons away. Luckily those neurons also can
replenish themselves. Those neurons are of the peripheral nervous
system, and like all peripheral system neurons they can replenish or
regenerate. So, if you burn your mouth in about a week or so hopefully
sooner you'll be able to taste again. In fact, everybody's ability to
taste is highly subject to training. You can really enhance your
ability to taste&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=4770"&gt;Protocol 3: Learn To Be A Super-Taster By Top-Down Behavioral Plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and taste the different component parts of different foods simply by
paying attention to what you're trying to taste, this is an amazing
aspect of the taste system. I think more than any other system, the
taste system and perhaps the smell system as well can be trained so
that you can learn to pick out the tones, if you will of different ice
cream, or different beverages. I'm somebody who, you know, I don't
drink much alcohol, I'll occasionally have a drink or something, but a
while ago I got to taste a bunch of different white tequilas, these
are different kinds of tequilas that are, they're not brown, they're
white. And I sort of assumed that all tequila was disgusting, that was
my assumption before doing this. And then I tasted a couple of white
tequilas and I realized oh, those aren't aren't too bad. I tasted a
few more, and then pretty soon I could really start to detect the
nuance and the difference. Now, I haven't had a tequilas in a long
time, now I sort of tend to not drink at all these days, but in a very
short period of time like a couple of days I got very good at
detecting which things I liked and I could start to pick out tones.
So, I'm not a wine drinker, but for those of you that are, you know,
you hear about oh, it has floral tones, or berry tones, or chocolate
tones. You know, some of that is just kind of menu-based and kind of
marketing-based silliness designed to get you excited about what
you're about to ingest. But some of it is real, and for people that
are skilled in assessing wines or assessing foods. I'm much more of an
eater than a drinker, you can really start to develop a sensitive
palate, a nuanced palette through what we call top-down mechanisms.
This olfactory cortex that takes these five, maybe the sixth fat
receptor too, information and tries to make sense of what's out there
in the world. And what its utility is, is it good? Is it bad? Do I
want more of it or less than it? That neural circuitry is unlike other
neural circuitry in that it seems very amenable to behavioral
plasticity for whatever reason, and we could talk about what those
reasons might be. You know, it's interesting sometimes to think about
how your taste literally, chemical taste, is probably very different
than that of other people, how a food tastes to you is probably very
different than how it tastes to somebody else. The same probably
cannot be said of something like vision or hearing, unless you're
somebody who has perfect pitch or your color vision is disrupted, or
you're a mantis shrimp, chances are when we look at the same object
two people are seeing more or less the same object or perceiving it in
a very similar way. There are experiments that essentially establish
that. Now we, have taste receptors and a lot of those tastes
receptors, their chemical structures are known, they come with fancy
names like the T1R1 or the T1R2, which were identified as the sweet
and umami receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=4940"&gt;The Umami-Sweet Distinction: Tigers Versus Pandas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's interesting is that this umami flavor is the savory flavor
rather that's sensed by umami receptors is very close to the receptor
that detects sweet things. Similarly, bitter is sensed by a whole
other set of receptors. Now, there's a fun naturally occurring
experiment that will forever change the way that you look at animals,
and the way certainly that I think about dogs and Costello in
particular. Carnivorous large animals like tigers and some grizzly
bears for instance, we know that they have no ability to detect sweet,
they don't actually have the receptors for sweet on their tongue, but
their concentration of umami receptors of their ability to detect
savory is at least 5,000 times that which it is in humans. In other
words, if I eat a little piece of steak, or Costello eats a little
piece of steak, that steak probably tastes much, much more savory than
it does to me. So dogs, and tigers, and bears, et cetera, they're
going to taste savory things and smell savory things with a much
higher degree of sensitivity, but they can't taste sweet things. Other
large animals, which are mostly herbivores like the panda bear for
instance. It's hard to believe that thing is even a bear, I got
nothing against pandas, I just think that they get a little bit too
much of the limelight frankly. So, no vendetta against Panda, save the
pandas, I hope they replenish all the pandas, but pandas in all their
whatever have no umami receptors, they can't taste savory, but they
have greatly heightened density of sweet receptors. So, there they are
eating these whatever bamboos all day or not bamboozle, but bamboos
all day and they can taste things that are very sweet with a much
higher degree of intensity. And in general, animals that are more
gentle that are herbivores, excuse me. Or animals that have the
propensity for aggression, that's where you really see the divergence
of the umami receptor because it's associated with meat and amino
acids. And where you see the enhancement of the sweet receptors for
animals that eat a lot of plants and fruits, and they probably taste
very different to them than they do to you and me. And, so it's
interesting to note that animals that eat meat, that eat other
organisms can actually extract more savory experience from that. What
does this mean for you? All right, do you associate yourself as a
tiger, or a grizzly bear, or a panda, or a combination of both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=5105"&gt;Eating More Plants Versus Eating More Meat, Cravings &amp;amp; Desire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are omnivores. However, you may find it interesting that
people that for instance eat a pure carnivore type diet or a keto diet
where they are ingesting a lot of meat, so therefore are sensing a lot
of umami flavors. And I realized not everyone who's keto eats meat,
but those who do that will develop a more sensitive palate and likely
there are some data, although early data, craving for umami-like
foods. Whereas people that eat a more plant-based diet are likely
developing a heightened sensitivity and desire for, and maybe even
dopamine response to sugars and plant-based foods. Now, this is my
partial attempt to reconcile the kind of online battle that seems to
exist between plant-based versus animal-based, purely plant-based or
purely animal-based diets. I think most people are omnivores, but it's
kind of interesting to think that the systems are plastic such that
people might want more meat if they eat more meat, people might want
more plants if they eat enough plants for a long period of time. And
this might explain some of the chasm that exists between these two
groups. Now, this is not to say anything about the ethical or the
environmental impacts of different things, I don't even want to get
into that because the meat people say that the plant-based diets have
as much a negative impact as the plant people say that the meat based
diets, that's a totally different discussion. What I'm talking about
here is food craving and food seeking and one's ability to detect
these umami, savory flavors is going to be enhanced by ingesting more
meat and less activation of the sweet receptors. So in other words,
the more meat you eat the more you're going to become like a tiger, so
to speak. And the more that you avoid these umami flavors and meats
and the more that you would eat plant-based foods and in particular
sweet foods, the more you will likely suppress that umami system and
that you will have a heightened desire for, appetite for and sensing
of sweet foods or foods that contain sugars. What I'm about to tell
you is going to seem crazy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=5235"&gt;Food That Makes You Feel Good Or Bad: Taste Receptors On Our Testes Or Ovaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but is extremely interesting with respect to taste and taste
receptors. Remember, even though we can enjoy food and we can evolve
our sense of what's tasty or not tasty, depending on life decisions,
environmental changes, et cetera, the taste system just like the
olfactory system and the visual system was laid down for the purpose
of moving towards things that are good for us and moving away from
things that are bad for us, that's the kind of core function of the
nervous system. Well, taste receptors are not just expressed on the
tongue, they are expressed in other cells and other tissues as well.
Some of you may be able to imagine foods that are so delicious to you
that they make your entire body feel good. Or foods that are so
horrifically awful to think about let alone taste, that they create a
whole body shuddering or kind of repellent-type response where you
just either cringe or turn your face away even in the absence of that
food. That's sort of how I feel about pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. If
you like Gorgonzola cheese, I don't judge you, I just, that's an
individual difference. I happen to love certain foods, I do like
savory foods very much. I, when I think about them, they just they
make me feel good. And I'm oftentimes not even associating with the
taste of those foods, it feels almost like a visceral thing. Well, it
turns out that some of the taste receptors extend beyond the tongue,
that they actually can extend into portions of the gut and digestive
system. And if that's not strange enough, turns out that some of the
taste receptors are actually expressed on the ovaries and the testes.
So, what that means is that the gonads, the very cells, and tissues,
and organs in our body that make up the reproductive axis are
expressing taste receptors. Okay, so how do we interpret this? Does
this mean that when you eat something that's very savory or very sweet
for instance, that it's triggering activation of the ovaries or of the
testes? Well, it's possible. Now, how those molecules, those chemical
molecules would actually get there isn't clear, the digestive track
does not run directly to the testes or to the ovaries. But
nonetheless, what this means is that chemical sensing of the very
things that we detect on our tongue and that we call taste in quotes
in food is also evoking cellular responses within the reproductive
gonads. Now, whether or not this underlies the positive association
that we have with certain foods isn't clear, but I'd be remiss if I
didn't point out the obvious, which is that the relationship between
the sensual nature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=5405"&gt;Biological Basis For The Sensuality of Umami and Sweet Foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of particular foods and sensuality generally and the reproductive axis
is something that's been covered in many movies, there are entire
movies that are focused on the relationship between for instance,
chocolate and love and reproductive behaviors, or certain feasts of
meat and their wonderful tastes and the kind of sensuality around
feasts of different types of foods, but in general, it's the sweet and
the savory, rarely is it the sour or the bitter, the salty or the fat.
And not surprisingly perhaps, it is the T2Rs and the T1Rs, the
receptors that are associated with the sweet and with the umami, the
savory flavors that are expressed not just on the tongue and in
portions of the digestive tract, but on the gonads themselves. So,
what does this mean? Does this mean that eating certain foods can
stimulate the gonads? Maybe, there's no data that immediately support
that right now, but this is an emerging area. If you'd like to read
more about this there's a great review, entitled Taste perception:
From the tongue to the testis, although they do also talk about the
ovaries. Why they didn't include that in the title is I think a
reflection of the bias of the author. The author indeed not
incidentally is Feng Li, last name L-I. It's a very interesting paper
published in Molecular Human Reproduction. You can find it easily
online, it's downloadable, I'll also provide a link to it. I just
think it's fascinating that these taste receptors are expressed in
other tissues. And I should mention that they're expressed in tissues
of other areas of the body as well, including the respiratory system,
but the richest aggregation or concentration of these receptors for
umami and sweet of course is on the tongue, but also on the gonads.
And I think it does speak to the possible bridge between what we think
of as a sensory or a sensual experience of food and the deeper kind of
visceral sense within the gut, and maybe even within the gonads as
well of something that we find extremely pleasurable, or even
appetitive that we want to move toward it. We are actually going to
return to that general theme in the discussion about touch sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=5548"&gt;Appetitive &amp;amp; Aversive Sensing: Touching Certain Surfaces, Tasting Certain Foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people for instance, when they touch certain surfaces like furs,
or sheep skins, or velvet, or soft, smooth surfaces it feels good
elsewhere in their body, not just at the point of contact with that
surface. And similarly, if there's the... How about this one? The
screech of chalk on a chalkboard, it's a sound, but it has a very
strong visceral component, or sandpaper, like fingernails on a
chalkboard, not the sound, but the feeling, right? Exactly, so our
whole nervous system is tuned to either be drawn toward appetitive, or
repelled by aversive behaviors, right? So there's this push-pull that
exists, and what I'm referring to in terms of these receptors on the
tongue that are also expressed on the gonads is yet another example of
what at least in this case seems to be an appetitive thing, a desire
to move toward certain foods and maybe even the experiences that are
associated with those foods. I want to talk about a particular aspect
of food and a chemical reaction in cooking called the Maillard
reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=5615"&gt;Amino Acids Are Key To Life, The Maillard Reaction, Smell-Taste Merge, Food Texture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you have probably heard of the Maillard reaction, it's spelled
M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. The D is silent, so don't call it the Maillard
reaction, and it's not the Maillard reaction, it is the Maillard
reaction. And the Maillard reaction is a reaction that for the
aficionados is a non-enzymatic browning. The other form of non-
enzymatic browning is caramelization, although when you hear caramel,
carmel, I think it's caramel. You think sweet, and indeed
caramelization is a sugar-sugar chemical interaction that leads to a
kind of nicely toasted not burnt, but nicely toasted sweet taste.
Whereas the Maillard reaction is that really savory reaction that
occurs when you have a sugar amino acid reaction. Remember, we have
neurons in our gut, but also neurons in our tongue and neurons deep in
the brain that are comparing the amount of sugar to savory. Okay, and
the Maillard reaction is very interesting for you chemists out there,
this is going to be way too elementary. And for you non-chemists it's
probably going to be a little bit of a reach, but just bear with me,
all these chemicals that we sense have a different structure, it's
like hydrogens, and oxygens, and aldehyde groups, and all these
things. And basically the Maillard reaction involves what's called a
free aldehyde. If you didn't like chemistry, don't worry about it,
it's basically got a group there that kind of sits open that allows it
to interact with other things and actually through the use of heat and
the process that we call brazing, which I'll talk about in a moment
you create a what's called a ketone group. Now, most people now have
heard of ketones 'cause they think about the ketogenic diet, but a
ketone group is actually a chemical compound that can be used for
energy, and that's why people say you can use ketones for energy, but
if you've ever actually encountered ketones, if you for instance, get
liquid ketones, a ketone ester, and you smell it, what does it smell
like? It smells a little bit like an alcohol, but it has a kind of
savory taste, even when you smell it. Okay, there are other smells
that have these tastes too, but for the Maillard reaction which could
be created for instance like if you took a piece of meat, or if you're
not a meat eater if you took tomatoes and you cook them in a pan and
you cooked it nice and slow till it's simmered and almost started to
brown and burn a little bit. Usually if I do it burns, I'm not a good
cook as Costello points out a lot, but it gets that like almost tangy,
very umami-like flavor. And sometimes it will even stick to the pan,
if you scrape it off and actually you can taste it in your mouth as
you're cooking it. That's the Maillard reaction, that's that free
aldehyde group, and that's the production of a ketone group. When you
smell ketones, it smells very much like that. Okay, some people talk
about the ketones will produce like fruity breath. And that's true if
people are really far into ketosis, their breath has a kind of fruity
odor, that's a little bit of a different thing. So, the relationship
between smell and taste is a very, very close one. And this is why
when people drink wine they often will inhale and then sip, some of
that is just kind of like pomp and circumstance frankly, they make a
big deal of it, but they can sense things with their mouth. The
combination of odor receptors being activated in a particular way, and
taste receptors in the mouth being activated in a particular way,
triggers the activation of multiple brain areas that are associated
with taste, and circuitry within the body that's associated with the
behaviors that relate to that taste like leaning toward it, or leaning
away from it depending on whether or not it's appetitive or aversive.
So the Maillard reaction is a very interesting reaction involving this
sugar amino acid thing, but really it's what it's doing is heating up
food such that the amino acids are more available literally in their
chemical form for detection by the neurons. This is a phenomenon that
occurs in other domains of the taste system. For instance, a lot of
what's happened with highly processed foods is that manufacturers have
figured out how to trigger more dopamine response by ingestion of
these sugary foods and created textures, and created essentially
design of foods for two purposes. I'm not out to completely demonize
processed food, I did that in a previous episode, but processed foods
are really designed to take foods that ordinarily would spoil, that
would have a shelf life and extend their shelf life to turn foods
which are not a commodity into a commodity. Something could be stored
and used essentially as a tradable purchasable, sellable resource. In
doing that they change, they've also decided to change the texture so
that you want to chew more of them. Like I have this thing I don't
know what it is for those Triscuit crackers. I don't know why are
those things so good? It's probably the texture, got those layers,
they're just kind of perfectly salty. I haven't had one in a long
time, so I bet if I had one now it wouldn't taste as good as I'm
imagining it. But those combinations of texture, smell, and taste are
what combine to activate these different brain areas that make you
really want to desire something. And the people who make foods,
processed foods in particular, are phenomenally good at figuring out
what drives the dopamine system and makes you want more of these
things either because of the way they taste and/or because of the way
they trigger neurons in your gut that have nothing to do with taste
that simply make you desire more of the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=5940"&gt;How Processed Food Make You Crave More Processed Foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, many of the foods that are processed foods make you
desire more of them, it's impossible to eat one chip kind of thing.
Not because they taste good, but because in your gut they're
activating the neurons that activate dopamine which make you seek more
of those foods independent of blood sugar or anything else. So, you
may actually be eating more particular foods not because they taste
good, but because they feel good on your tongue and mouth, and because
the neurons in your gut which are totally independent of conscious
taste are triggering the release of dopamine which is a molecule that
makes you seek more of, and do more of anything that led to the
ingestion of that food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=5984"&gt;Protocol 4: Invert Your Sense of Sweet &amp;amp; Sour: Miracle Fruit; Swapping Bitter &amp;amp; Sweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a fun experiment that you can do, which is to completely
invert your sense of sweet and sour, there's actually a way to do this
readily. When I was a post-doc, I used to have a journal club at my
house, people would come over in the evening once a month, and we
would read a paper, typically the weirdest paper we could find and we
would eat food and hang out, that's what nerds did and do for fun, so
that's what we did. And one time someone brought what's called miracle
berry. Okay, so this isn't some psychedelic plant medicine thing,
miracle berry, you can purchase online, it's relatively inexpensive.
It actually causes a change in the configuration of taste receptors
such that when you eat something sour, it tastes sweet. And so what's
really wild is you ingest miracle berry, and then you bite into a
lemon, maybe even the lemon and peel and it tastes as sweet as a
peach. And this effect lasts several hours. Definitely, you know,
check any warnings, I don't know what sort of warnings these, a
miracle berry carries, but I'm sure there's always something, you can
imagine. There are a number of papers on miracle berry or miracle
fruit it's called, but it changes your perception of sour at a
perceptual level, but it does that by changing the activity of the
receptors in the mouth and tongue. Now, this is important as a
principle and it's underscored by experiments that have been done by
for instance Charles Zuker's lab at Columbia University, where they've
essentially genetically engineered animals such that the bitter
receptor is swapped with the sweet receptor, or the sweet receptor is
swapped with the bitter receptor. And what they show is that the
actual food, the experience on the tongue drives different pathways in
the brain. Here's what they did, they essentially took mice and
swapped out the sweet receptor and put in a bitter receptor. And then
what they found is that whereas normally mice would actively seek out
and even work for sugar water, sucrose, they really like that. If they
replace the sweet receptor with the bitter receptor, the mice would
avoid sugar water. And the reverse was also true, that mice would
drink a bitter solution avidly, they liked a bitter solution if they
swapped out the bitter receptor for sweet receptor. What this means is
that our entire experience of what we taste is dependent on how we
experience that taste the level of the tongue. And so, you're
hopefully not going to do genetic engineering of your taste receptors,
but if you'd like to do this sort of experiment you actually can do it
very easily using miracle fruit, the instructions of how much to
ingest, et cetera, any safety concerns are usually on the package and
should be easy to find. And there's a lot of science to support how
this works, it's kind of a fun experiment that anyone can do and will
completely change your perception of any food that you're accustomed
to eating. In fact, you can figure out how much sweet or the sense of
sweetness is contributing to your experience of a food, even if you
don't think of it as a sweet food through this miracle fruit
experiment. You could take miracle fruit, you could eat a slice of
pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza, which perhaps normally to you would
taste just like pizza, and you'll notice it tastes very different.
What you are detecting is how much the sense of sweet was contributing
to that particular flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=6183"&gt;Pheromones, Desire To Continue Mating: Coolidge Effect Occurs In Males &amp;amp; Females&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'd like to return to pheromones. As I mentioned earlier, true
pheromonal effects are well-established in animals. And one of the
most remarkable pheromone effects that's ever been described is one
that actually I've mentioned before on this podcast, but I'll mention
again just briefly, which is the Coolidge effect. The Coolidge effect
is the effect of a male of a given species, in most cases, it tended
to be a rodent or a rooster mating. And at some point reaching
exhaustion or the inability to mate again because they just simply
couldn't for whatever reason. The Coolidge effect establishes that if
you swap out the hen with a new hen, or the female rat or mouse with a
new one then the rat or the rooster spontaneously regains their
ability to mate, somehow their vigor is returned, the refractory
period after mating that normally occurs is abolished and they can
mate again. It turns out that the Coolidge effect runs in the opposite
direction too. I did not know this, but I recently learned of a study,
it was actually done in hamsters, not in in mice, but it turns out
that females also will, female rodents will mate to exhaustion. And at
some port... At some point, excuse me, they will refuse to mate any
longer unless you swap in a new male. And then because mating in
rodents involves the female being receptive, there are certain number
of behaviors that mean that tell you that she's willing and wanting to
mate, so-called lordosis reflex. Then if there's a new male, she will
spontaneously regain the lordosis reflex and the desire to mate. And
how do you know this? How do we know it's a pheromonal effect? Well,
this recovery of the desire and ability to mate both in males and in
females can be evoked completely by the odor of a new male or female,
it doesn't even have to be the presentation of the actual animal. And
that's how you know that it's not some visual interaction or some
other interaction, it's a pheromonal interaction. Now, as I mentioned
earlier, pheromonal effects in humans have been debated for a long
period of time. We are thought to have a vestigial, meaning a kind of
shrunken down miniature accessory olfactory bulb called Jacobson's
organ, or the vomeronasal organ. Some people don't believe that
Jacobson's organ exists, some people do, there is anatomical evidence
for it in some cadavers. It sits not very high up in the brain or
where your olfactory bulb is, but it's actually in the nasal passages,
so there's like little dents as you go up through your nasal passages,
and there is evidence of something that's vomeronasal-like.
Vomeronasal is the pheromonal organ, they call it Jacobson's organ if
it's present in humans, kind of tucked into some of the divots in the
nasal passage. Even if that organ, Jacobson's organ isn't there or is
not responsible for the chemical signaling between individuals, there
is chemical signaling between human beings. As I mentioned earlier,
the effect of tears in suppressing the areas of the brain that are
involved in sexual desire and testosterone of males, that's a concrete
result, that's a very good result published by an excellent group with
no pre-existing bias going in, that's just what they found. There is
also evidence both for and against chemical signaling between females
in terms of synchronization of menstrual cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=6400"&gt;Do Women Influence Each Others Menstrual Cycles?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the original paper on this was published in the 1970s by
McClintock, and it essentially said that when women live together in
group housing, dormitories, and similar that their menstrual cycles
were synchronized and that was due to what was hypothesized to be
pheromonal effects. Over the years, that study has been challenged
many, many times. The more recent data point to the idea that there is
chemical-chemical signaling between women in ways that impact the
timing of the menstrual cycle, but that depending on whether or not
some of the women are in the ovulation phase, the ovulatory phase of
that cycle or whether or not they are in the follicular phase, the
phase when the follicle is maturing before the egg actually obviates.
So two separate phases of the 28 day menstrual cycle will either
lengthen or shorten the menstrual cycle of the person that smells
those women. Translated into English what that means is that it is
very likely it seems that something, maybe pheromones, but maybe some
other chemical that is independent of pheromones is being conveyed
between women that are housed together or spend a lot of time together
to shift their menstrual cycle, but it doesn't necessarily mean that
they synchronize. So for instance, if one woman is in the follicular
phase of the menstrual cycle, it might shorten or delay ovulation.
Excuse me, it might accelerate ovulation in another woman, whereas if
somebody is in the ovulatory phase of their cycle, it might lengthen
the menstrual cycle out so that they, the woman who smells that
person's scent or who smells her sweat, we still don't know the origin
of the chemical would ovulate later. So, all of this is to say is that
chemical-chemical signaling is happening from females to males through
tears, we know that. Is that a pheromonal effect? Well, by the strict
definition of a pheromone, a molecule that's released from one
individual that impacts the biology of another individual, yes. But in
terms of identifying what the pheromone is in tears, that's still
unknown, it's not clear what the chemical compound is. So, we're
reluctant as scientists to call it a true pheromonal effect. The
menstrual cycle and the synchronization of the menstrual cycle effect
seems to hold up under some conditions. But in some cases, there's a
kind of clash of menstrual cycles that's created by chemicals that are
emitted from one female to another. So, there are many examples of
this in humans, for instance, people can recognize the t-shirt of
their mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=6559"&gt;Recognizing the Smell Of Your Romantic Partner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you give... This experiment has been done many times, I know it's
been challenged a number of times, but the data are pretty good by now
that if you offer, you take a collection of women who are in stable
relationships with somebody, you offer them the smell of a hundred
different shirts and they can very readily pick out their significant
others scent. Okay, that's pure olfaction, that's not pheromonal, but
nonetheless is a remarkable degree of discrimination, olfactory
discrimination. You can dilute their partner's scent down to the point
where they themselves can't consciously detect the difference between
the sweat or the t-shirt of a hundred different t-shirts or so, they
might say, "I don't really smell the difference, but I think it's this
one. Yeah, this one belongs to the person that I've been with." And
they are much greater than chance at detecting the t-shirt or
identifying the t-shirt correctly. So, there's no question really that
there is chemical-chemical signaling between humans, the question is
whether or not it's truly pheromonal in basis. Now, you'll notice that
a lot of the examples I gave aside from the one of tears is women
detecting the scents of men or of other women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=6630"&gt;Differences In Odor Detection Ability, Effects Of Hormones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it turns out that there are a number of papers, the best one I
think that I could find is published in Physiology and Behavior in
2009, it's a review entitled Sex Differences and Reproductive Hormone
Influences on Human Odor Perception by Doty, D-O-T-Y, and Cameron. I
encourage you to check out this review it's available free as a
download, we'll provide a link to it, you can get the full PDF if you
want. But it does seem that women are better at detecting odors in
these odor discrimination tasks than are men. And yes, that it does
vary according to where they are in their menstrual cycle. And yes,
they also looked at people who had received gonadectomy, they had
their ovaries removed, a number of different important controls. None
of this surprises me, none of this should surprise you, it's very
clear that hormones have a profound effect on enlarge number of
systems in our biology and that smell, and taste, and the ability to
sense the chemical states of others, either consciously or
subconsciously have a profound influence on whether or not we might
want to spend time with them, whether or not this is somebody that
we're pair bonded with, whether or not this is somebody that we just
met and don't trust yet, things of this sort. And given what's at
stake in terms of reproductive biology, not just offspring, but given
the possibility of transmission of diseases, et cetera, you know, the
risks of childbirth, et cetera. It makes so much sense that much of
our biology is wired toward detecting and sensing whether or not
things and people are things that we should approach or avoid, whether
or not reproduction with that person is the appropriate response or
suppression of the reproductive response is the appropriate response,
right? As in that's the case with the tears. So, I think these are
fascinating studies, it's an area that still needs a lot of work, but
there are some really wonderful papers on this. And the one that I
mentioned a few minutes ago, Sex Differences and Reproductive Hormone
Influences on Human Odor Perception is one of the better reviews that
are out there. There are also a number of other reviews for instance
that talk about pheromone effects and their impact on mood, and sexual
responses, and things of that sort, and we will also provide some
links to those. A lot of this is still speculative, but I want to say
I know I said it three times, what I really want to underscore because
it is vitally important, and people seem to get a little triggered by
the notion of pheromones. Just because we haven't identified the
actual chemical compound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=6780"&gt;We Rub The Chemicals Of Others On Our Eyes and Skin, Bunting Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that's acting as a pheromone or putative pheromone does not mean that
chemical-chemical signaling between individuals doesn't exist, clearly
it does. Actually, you and every other human from the time you're born
until the time you die are actively seeking out and sensing and
evaluating the chemicals that come from other individuals. There's a
really nice study that was done by the Weizmann Institute, a group
there, I think it was also Noam Sobel's group, but another group as
well as I recall looking at human-human interactions when they meet
for the first time. It's a remarkable study because what they found
was people would reach out and shake hands. It's is a typical
response, you know pre-pandemic, people would meet, they'd reach out
and they would shake hands. And what they observed was almost every
time within just a few seconds of having shaken hands with this new
individual, people will touch their eyes almost without fail.
Occasionally, they would touch their eyebrow, occasionally someone
would touch their hair. We always associate that with people having
some sort of... Or us having some sort of self-conscious response like
oh, we want to make sure shirt tucked in and all prim and proper,
whatever it is, or looking right, is there something you're like
teeth? This kind of thing, but actually people are doing that even if
the person they just met left the room. So, someone's sitting there,
someone comes in, they shake hands, and the person inevitably
subconsciously touches their eyes. They are taking chemicals from the
skin contact and they are placing it on a mucosal membrane of some
sort, typically not up to their nose or in their mouth, typically on
their eyes. Now, animals do this all the time, there's a phenomenon in
animals called bunting. If you have a overeager dog that when you meet
them or you see them again after you've been away for the day they'll
rub their head against you, right? Cats will do this too, it's called
bunting, they're rubbing their scent glands on you, they're marking
you. And believe it or not, you're marking other people when you shake
their hand, and they are then taking your mark and rubbing it on
themselves subconsciously. So, we all do these kinds of behaviors, and
now that you're aware of it you can watch for it in your environment,
you can pay attention to people. Some of this has probably changed in
light of the events of 2020, et cetera, but nonetheless, we are
evaluating the molecules on people's breath, we are evaluating the
molecules on people's skin by actively rubbing it on ourselves. And we
are actively involved in sensing not just their facial expressions,
the size of their pupils, and things like that, but the chemicals that
they are emitting, their hormone status, how they smell. We're
detecting the pheromones possibly, but certainly the odors in their
breath. You might say, "Well, I don't actually go around sniffing
people's breath. I don't, you know, unless if it's bad," in which case
it's aversive, but breath is communicating a lot of signals. And this
handshake eye rub experiment shows that we are actively going through
behaviors reflexively to wipe ourselves or smear ourselves with other
people's chemicals. Now, that might seem odd or even gross to you, but
I think it's beautiful, I think that it illustrates the extent to
which we as human beings are in some ways among the other animals in
our subconscious, sometimes conscious, but certainly subconscious
tendency to try and evaluate our chemical environment through what we
inhale through our nose, what we ingest through our mouth, and what we
actively take off other people's skin and rub on ourselves to evaluate
it and what we should do about it, and perhaps that person as well. So
today, we talked a lot about olfaction taste and chemical sensing
between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&amp;amp;t=7000"&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to think that you now know a lot about how your smell system
works and why inhaling is a really good thing to do in general for
waking up your brain, and for cognitive function, and for enhancing
your sense of smell. We talked about how to enhance your sense of
taste, and we talked about chemical signaling between individuals as a
way of communicating some important aspects about biology. People are
shaping each other's biology all the time by way of these chemicals
that are being traded from one body to the next through air, and skin
to skin contact, and tears. If you're enjoying this podcast and you're

convert  light information into electricity the rest of the brain can
understand and how our brain  creates the incredible thing we
experience as “sight”. I also describe how we can train and support
our visual system to improve at any age. I describe more than a dozen
protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness,
improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and
our mental focus generally). I also explain how to use eyesight to
improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy
eyes and colorblindness occur. I also describe various compounds that
may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our
vision. Many simple, zero-cost protocols and a lot of scientific
mechanisms are covered in this episode in clear language anyone can

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [gentle music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that
theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first
sponsor is Roka. Founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford,
Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses have really been designed with the
utmost care and the utmost attention to the science of optics and the
visual system. So one of the things I like so much about Roka
eyeglasses and sunglasses is that they're extremely lightweight. If
you get sweaty, so for instance, if you wear them while running, or
walking, or hiking, they don't slip off. And with the sunglasses, when
you're outdoors, if there's cloud cover, or if there's shadows, or if
the day gets brighter or dimmer, you can still see your surroundings
perfectly well. And that's because the designers at Roka really
understand the way the visual system works how it habituates, how it
adapts. You don't need to understand the science behind all that, but
they do, and as a consequence the eyeglasses perform extremely well
under all conditions, whether or not that's indoors or outdoors. So
they put a ton of science and purpose into the design. They also
happen to look really good. They have a really nice aesthetic. A lot
of, as you know, performance active wear eyeglasses look rather
ridiculous, but the Roka glasses, I think, have a very nice aesthetic
to them that you can wear anywhere. If you'd like to check out Roka
glasses, you can go to Roka, that's roka.com and enter the code
Huberman at checkout, and you'll get 20% off your first order. That's

your order. Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and
reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood
work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact
our immediate and longterm health can only be analyzed from a blood
test. And now, with the advent of modern DNA tests, we can also get
insight into our specific DNA makeup and how that influences our
lifestyle choices and our health status. The problem with a lot of
blood tests is that you get a lot of information back, but you don't
always know what to do with that information. With Inside Tracker,
they have a very easy to use, personalized dashboard platform that
informs you what sorts of lifestyle, nutrition, exercise, changes you
might want to make, according to the levels of particular metabolic
factors, hormone factors, et cetera, in your blood and DNA. So it
makes everything very simple, both in terms of where you're at health-
wise and what you should or could do, in order to improve your health,
something I do believe most everybody would like to do. With Inside
Tracker, it makes all that very easy. They also have something called
the inner age test. This is a test that shows you what your biological
age and compares to that, of course, to your chronological age. And,
of course, your biological age is really what you want to know,
because it's a predictor of how long you're going to live and the
quality of your life. If you'd like to try Inside Tracker, you can
visit insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get 25%
off any of Inside Tracker's plans, just use the code Huberman at
checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix
Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are ideally suited to your
sleep needs. Everybody needs something different in terms of what to
sleep on. Some people like a hard mattress. Some people like a soft
mattress. Some people tend to run warm. Some people tend to run cold.
With Helix Sleep, you go to their website, you take a very brief two-
minute quiz, and you answer some questions such as, do you tend to
sleep on your stomach, or your side, or your back? Maybe you don't
know. Do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera. At the end of that
quiz, you match to a specific mattress. I took that quiz about six
months ago, and I matched to the Dusk Mattress, and I've been sleeping
on a Dusk mattress from Helix for the last six months, and I've been
sleeping better than I ever have before. Basically, everyone's unique,
and Helix understands that, and that's built into the design of their
mattresses and this two-minute quiz that you take to match you to one.
If you'd like to try a Helix Sleep mattress, you can go to
helixsleep.com/huberman, take their two-minute quiz, and they'll match
you to a customized mattress. You'll also get up to $200 off any
mattress order and two free pillows. They make terrific pillows.
You'll get a 10-year warranty on that mattress, and you get to try it
out for 100 nights risk-free. If you don't like it, they'll come pick
it up and take it away. You won't get charged, you'll get your money
back, et cetera. So that's helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off
and two free pillows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=291"&gt;Protocol: Concurrent Training For Endurance, Strength, Hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now beginning a new topic for the next four to five episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast. Before we move into that, I want to just
briefly touch on a couple questions that I got from the last episode,
which was related to the science of endurance training. I described
the four kinds of endurance training. We posted protocols of the
specific four kinds of endurance training at hubermanlab.com. Just go
to that episode, you can see the download, it's a zero-cost PDF. I got
a lot of questions about what's called concurrent training, which is
how to program endurance training if you are also interested in
strength and hypertrophy training. Or how to incorporate strength and
hypertrophy training, which was in the previous episode, with
endurance training. This can all be made very simple. Ask yourself,
what are you trying to emphasize, and then emphasize that for a 10 to
12 week cycle. So if you're mostly interested in endurance, I would
say use a three to two ratio, maybe get three endurance training
workouts per week, maybe four, and two strength and hypertrophy
workouts. If you're mainly focusing on strength and hypertrophy, get
three or four workouts for strength and hypertrophy and do two
endurance workouts. Start with the minimum number of sets that's
required to get the result that you want. So if you're not accustomed
to doing endurance work, you would start with the minimum number
that's listed on that protocol. So if it says three to five sets, you
would start with three, maybe even just two, and then work your way up
by adding sets each week. I do suggest that people get at least one
complete rest day per week. And although I know a lot of people don't
like that, I benefit from that. I actually benefit from having two
complete rest days each week. I just continue to make progress that
way, whether or not it's for strength and hypertrophy or for
endurance. I am a big believer in rest days, other people are not. And
those could be active rest days, hiking, relaxing, et cetera. After a
10 to 12 week cycle, then I also suggest taking anywhere from five to
seven days completely off. You can still enjoy life and do things, I
know for you addicted exercisers that you're going to loathe to do
that, but that's one way to stay injury free, keep your joints and
tissues healthy over time, and continue to make progress. If you don't
want to do that week off, don't do it. None of this is holy. None of
it is a strict prescriptive. Just ask yourself, what are you going to
emphasize and emphasize that, in terms of the total volume of workouts
that you do, and work up incrementally, and then move into another
cycle. That's what I suggest. So go to hubermanlab.com, you can get
the protocol there. We are now going to move into a new topic
unrelated to physical performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=444"&gt;The Senses, Vision, Seeing &amp;amp; What We Should All Do To See Better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with this episode and for the next four to five episodes, we
are going to talk all about the senses. That's sight, eyesight,
hearing, touch, taste, smell, and we're also going to talk about this
critical sense that we call interoception, or our sense of our
internal real estate. Now, the reason that we are talking about the
senses is because if you understand how the senses are perceived, what
they're about, what the underlying cells and connections are about,
you will be in a terrific position to understand the month's topic
that follows, which is all about mental health. Now, I want to
emphasize that if you're somebody who doesn't have any trouble seeing,
hearing, tasting, smelling and has an excellent sense of
interoception, I do believe that these episodes will still be very
relevant to you, because they have everything to do with how you move
through the world, how you make sense of information, and how you
organize your thoughts and your emotions. I also want to emphasize
that we're going to cover a lot of practical tools. So today's episode
is going to be all about vision and eyesight, a topic that's very near
and dear to my heart, because it's the one that I've been focusing on
for well over 25 years of my career. But we're not just going to get
into the mechanistic details about how light is converted into
electrical potentials and things like that. We are going to talk about
practical tools that you can and should use to help maintain the
health of your visual system and your eyesight. Very often, young
people will say, what should I do? You know, you're always talking
about, you know, neuroplasticity and how it tapers off over time, but
I'm a young person, what should I do? You should absolutely train and
support your eyesight. In fact, if you're a young person and you see
perfectly, or you feel as if you see the world perfectly, you are in
the best position to bolster, to reinforce that visual system, so that
you don't lose your vision as you age. In addition, you can leverage
your visual system for better mental and physical performance, and
we're going to talk about that. If you're somebody who suffers from a
clinical disorder of vision, you have trouble seeing, or if you need
corrective lenses in order to see, this episode is definitely for you.
And while of course I can't make clinical diagnoses, I can't have a
one-to-one conversation with any of you in this format, nor am I a
clinician, I'm a scientist, not a physician. I did consult with our
chair of ophthalmology, Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg at Stanford University
School of Medicine, as well as several other people to really vet the
information and make sure that the protocols that I'm describing are
consistent with the clinical literature. If you have a severe eye
problem, you should be working with a really good ophthalmologist
and/or optometrist, but certainly an an ophthalmologist who's a
medical doctor. But I do believe that the information that we're going
to discuss today is going to be relevant to everybody and will set the
stage for the month on mental health and mental performance. So, let's
get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=635"&gt;Our Eyes: What They Really Do, &amp;amp; How They Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we hear the word vision, we most often think about eyesight, or
our ability to perceive shapes, and objects, and faces, and colors.
And indeed, vision involves eyesight, our ability to see shapes, and
objects, and faces, and colors, and so forth. However, our eyes are
responsible for much more than that, including our mood, our level of
alertness, and all of that is included in what we call vision. So I
just want to take about three, maybe four minutes, and talk about how
the visual system works, how it's built, and how you are able to so-
called see things around you. I also want to describe the ways in
which your eyes and your visual system impact your mood and your level
of alertness. And then, we are going to get right into some protocols,
some specific things that each and all of you should do if you want to
enhance your vision and maintain your vision as you get older. And
again, if you're a 15-year-old or a 12-year-old, this episode is
especially for you, because your nervous system is far more plastic
than mine is. It's much more amenable to change, so you can really
build a very strong visual system. And in doing that, and if you adopt
specific behaviors at any age of light viewing at particular times and
particular ways, then you can build an emotional system that's also
reinforced by your visual system. So, let's talk about vision. What is
vision? Well, vision starts with the eyes. We have no what's called
extraocular light perception. While it feels good to have light on our
skin, while it feels good to be outside in the sunlight for most
people, the only way that light information can get to the cells of
your body is through these two little goodies on the front of your
face. And for those of you listening, I'm just pointing to my eyes. As
many of you have heard me say before, on this and other podcasts, your
eyes, in particular, your neural retinas are part of your central
nervous system. They are part of your brain. They're the only part of
your brain that sits outside the cranial vault. In other words, you
have two pieces of your brain that deliberately got squeezed out of
the skull during development and placed in these things we call eye
sockets. There's a genetic program for the specific purpose of making
sure that three little layers of neurons, nerve cells, got squeezed
out and form what are called your neural retinas. Now, the eyes have a
lot of other goodies in them that are very important, and those are
the goodies that we're going to focus on a lot today. There's a lens
to focus light, precisely to the retina. If you're somebody who
requires eyeglasses or contacts, chances are, you don't do that
correctly, and so, that's why you use other lenses, like eyeglasses or
contacts. There are also other pieces of the eye that are designed to
keep the eye lubricated. You also have these things that we call
eyelashes. Most people don't know this, but eyelashes are there to
trigger the blink reflex if a piece of dust or something gets in front
of your eye. It's a beautiful adaptation of nature. They aren't just
aesthetically nice. Costello happens to have very long eyelashes. He
gets compliments about this all the time. Maybe you have long
eyelashes. I don't have particularly long eyelashes. But the eyelashes
are there, so that if a piece of dust or something starts to head
towards the cornea, the eye blinks very, very fast. It's the fastest
reflex you own is your eye blink reflex. We also have these things
called eyelids. Now, eyelids might seem like the most boring topic of
all, but they are incredibly fascinating. Today, we're going to talk
about how you can actually use your visual system to increase your
levels of alertness based on the neural circuits that link your
brainstem with your eyelids. And no, we are not going to have a
blinking contest, because I would win and you would lose, and that
wouldn't be fun for you. So, let's talk about what the eyes do for
vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=870"&gt;Converting Light Into Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the entire job of the eyes is to collect light information
and send it off to the rest of the brain, in a form that the brain can
understand. Remember, no light actually gets in past those neural
retinas. It gets to the neural retina, and we have specific cells in
the eye called photoreceptors. They come in two different types, rods
and cones. Cones are mainly responsible for daytime vision, and the
rods are mainly responsible for vision at night or under low light
conditions, generally speaking. So basically what happens is if your
eyelids are open, light comes into the eye, the lens focuses that
light, light is also just called photons, light energy, onto the
retina. These photoreceptors, the rods and cones, have chemical
reactions inside them that involve things like vitamin A and that
chemical reaction converts the light into electricity. Now, that might
seem incredibly abstract, but the way to think about this is very
similar to, for instance, you have touch receptors on your skin and
when you press on those touch receptors, they convert pressure,
physical pressure, into electrical information and those neurons send
it up to your spinal cord and brain, and you can register that
somebody or you are touching the top of your hand, as I'm doing now.
With the eyes and the retina, it's just that light gets converted into
electrical information. Within the eye, within the retina, there are
then a series of stages of processing, and that information eventually
gets sent into the brain by a very specific class of neurons. I would
like you to know the names of these neurons. They're called retinal
ganglion cells. So the only thing you need to know about the
neuroscience of the eye at this point are that there are rods and
cones. The cones are involved in bright daytime vision and rods are
involved in more dusk or nighttime vision. And you've got these cells
called retinal ganglion cells that send the information off to the
rest of the brain. Now, here's what's incredible. I just want you to
ponder this for a second. This still blows my mind. Everything you see
around you, you're not actually seeing those objects directly. What
you're doing is you're making a best guess about what's there based on
the pattern of electricity that arrives in your brain. Now, that might
just seem totally wild and hard to wrap your head around, but think
about it this way, because this is the way it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=1020"&gt;We Don’t See Anything Directly: It Is All A Comparison Of Reflected Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take an example of a color, like green or blue. You have cones
in your eye that respond best to the wavelength of light that is
reflected off, say, a green apple. So, you don't actually see the
green apple. What you see is the light bouncing off that green apple,
and it goes into your eye, and you see it and perceive it as round and
green, but not because you see anything green. No green light arrives
in your brain. What happens is your brain actually compares the amount
of green reflection coming off that apple to the amount of red and
blue around it. Well, you might say, well, the green apple is sitting
on a brown table or a white surface. Well, then, it will appear very
green. Because the amount of wavelength of light for green is very
high, and the amount for red is very low, and so, it looks very green,
okay? So, we don't actually see anything directly. What the brain is
receiving is a series of signals, electrical signals, and it's
comparing electrical signals, in order to come up with what we call
these perceptions. Like I see something green, a green apple, or I see
red. Let me give you a slightly different example. If you were to play
a key on the piano, let's say you play, I'm not a musician, but I'm
going to, so hopefully I won't get this too incorrectly but let's say
you have like E sharp, and maybe it's like ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding. If the brain gets that signal, it doesn't actually know E that's
what, it doesn't recognize it until you were to play another key next
to it, dun, dun, dun, dun, and what it does, it does the math, it does
the subtraction, and it compares those two. So when we see something
green, or we see something red, or we see something blue, we're not
actually seeing it directly. The brain is making a guess about how
green or red or blue that thing is by comparing what's around it,
okay? And if that seems hard to wrap your head around, don't worry,
because we will explain it in more depth going forward. But I really
want people to understand this, that vision, eyesight, is not looking
at things directly, and that information getting directly into your
brain, it is translated. Light information is transformed into
electrical signals that your visual system exquisitely understands.
Now, what does this mean? Why should you care about this? Well, if you
have a dog like I do, or a cat,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=1175"&gt;Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, &amp;amp; You(r View Of The World)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they are not colorblind, but they lack the cones that respond to red,
meaning long wavelength light. So what does that mean? That means that
when they see green, it's different than the green you see. Not
because that apple is invisible to them, but because they aren't able
to compare it to red, and you are. As a consequence, when they look at
a green lawn, it looks more brownish or orange to them. When you wear
a red shirt in front of your dog or cat, if you see a stop sign and
they see a stop sign, they see orangish-brown, and you see red.
presuming that you are a trichromat, meaning you have three-color
vision. So, this is all to say that every animal sees the world
differently, depending on whether or not they have one or two or three
of these different cones, the red, blue, or green cones. If you are a
mantis shrimp of all things, you see hundreds of colors that human
beings can't see, okay? Many things animals see into visual ranges
that you and I can't see in. So for instance, a pit viper senses heat
emissions, it literally sees the heat coming off of you or of an
animal that they want to eat. If you are a ground squirrel, you can
see ultraviolet light. This is going to sound kind of weird, but
ground squirrels actually signal one another by standing up outside
and shining sunlight off each other's stomachs to each other,
signaling at a distance, just like, you know, you could signal
somebody with a mirror in sunlight at distance. There are species of
primates, this isn't very pleasant to think about, that urinate on
their hands, and then wipe it all over their stomach. and then use
that sunlight to reflect different signals to each other. I don't know
what they're saying. We always assume it's something cute and nice,
but maybe they're insulting each other. So this actually gets right
down to the heart of these bigger questions, like consciousness, what
do we see? What's out there? How much of life is really accessible to
us? And I could go on and on, you know, this used to be kind of an
obsession of mine when I was coming up in the field of visual
neuroscience to understand how different animals see the world
compared to us. You know, I'll give one more example, a diving bird,
you know, a bird that flies over the ocean. It has an incredible task.
It has to both view the horizon, and it has to view schools of fish,
and then, it has to make a trajectory down into the water and grab one
of those fish to eat. And the water has what's called a refractory
index. It actually shifts like a prism, the impression or the
perception of where that fish is, right? If the bird sees the fish
right below it, it has to know, it has to adjust its diving trajectory
just right, because it knows that that fish actually isn't where it
sees it. It's probably a few inches ahead or to the side of that,
because of the way that water diverts the image. If you've ever
dropped a coin to the bottom of a pool, if you go straight down
looking at that location. If you were to look from the top of the
pool, and you dive straight down with your eyes closed, you will miss,
because the water refracts, it shifts the visual image. Well, diving
birds have an arrangement of these retinal cells that communicate to
the brain that's both a streak to view the horizon, 'cause they need
to know where they are relative to the horizon, and they have a pupil
like we do on the bottom of their eye, so that they can make very
accurate dive and attacks on these schools of fish, and catch fish,
and eat those fish. We just have pupils in the middle of our eyes. So
there's a ton about the optics of the eye, and the way that it
communicates with the brain that allows us to see. We could spend
hours talking about this, but what I'd like to embed in your mind is
that what you experience in the outside world is bottlenecked, it's
limited by which wavelengths, which colors if you will, of light that
you can see. That your brain is coming up with a best guess about
what's there. It doesn't actually know what's there. And that your
vision is distinctly different from say, the vision of a dog or from
the vision of somebody who's a dichromat, meaning they don't have a
red cone. A lot of people, in particular about 1 in 80 males, lacks a
red cone and therefore, sees the world much the same way that Costello
does. Although, he sees it from just much lower toward the ground. So,
that's what I'd like you to understand about the way the eye
communicates with the brain. I would also like you to understand that
the brain itself is making these guesses and that those guesses are
largely right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=1445"&gt;Everything You See Is A Best Guess, Blind Spots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know that? Well, they're right because when you reach out to
grab a glass, most of the time you grab the glass, and you don't miss,
right? Most of the time, when you make judgments about the world
around you, based on your visual impression of them, it allows you to
move functionally through the world. But let me give you some examples
of where this guessing is happening right now. And it's so incredible
that, to this day, this still blows my mind. Cover one eye with one
hand. If you're driving, maybe don't do this. If you're viewing the
world around you, presumably you can see everything that's out there.
I could do this with one eye or the other eye. You probably see better
out of one or the other, and we'll talk about that. You have a giant
blind spot in the middle of your visual field. It's called your blind
spot. It is the spot in which the connections, the wires, from all
those retinal ganglion cells exit the back of the eye and head off
toward the brain. In other words, you are blind for a huge spot of
your central vision. The part of your vision that's highest acuity,
highest detail, and yet, you don't see that ever. You cover one eye,
and you see perfectly fine. And it's not just because your eye is
moving around really quickly. Your brain is guessing what's in that
spot, which is absolutely incredible, and so, you don't see that blind
spot. This is happening all the time. Now, when you have two eyes
open, the way that your eyes are positioned in your head and the way
they view the world is such that they fill in each other's blind
spots, so it's pretty convenient. But if you cover one eye, that's
impossible, and yet, you still see the world as complete. So the brain
is doing these incredible things. It's also creating depth, a sense of
depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=1550"&gt;Depth Perception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though what arrives from the retina is essentially a readout of a
two-dimensional, flat image, so it can sense depth. How do you know
depth? Well, this is very simple. Things that are closer to you tend
to be larger than things that are far away. Things that are closer to
you tend to look like they're moving faster. If you've ever been in a
train and you look to your side, the rungs on a fence, or the train
tracks going by you, look like they're going very fast. If you look
off in the distance, they look like they're moving very slowly. And
there are differences between what's close to you and what's further
away. So, a little house on the horizon, you don't look at it and say,
oh, that must be a tiny, little house. You have some prior knowledge
that things further away are smaller. So that's the main way that you
do that. And you compare the location, at which information about
light lands on the two eyes. So your eyes are slightly offset from one
another. So that, for instance, if I look at you, if you were standing
right in front of me right now, and I were to look at you, the image
of your face, the light bouncing off your face to be more precise,
lands on one eye in a slightly different location than it does in the
other eye, and then the brain does math. It basically does the
equivalent of geometry and trigonometry, and essentially figures out
how far away you are from me, which is just incredible. So the brain
does all this very, very fast, and the brain uses about 40 to 50% of
its total real estate for vision. That's how important vision is. Now,
for those of you that are blind, or low vision, or no vision, that
real estate in the brain will be taken over by neurons that control
sense of touch and a sense of hearing, and your, indeed, hearing and
touch are much better, higher acuity, and faster in blind people. But
for most of you, who I presume are sighted, this is how it works. So,
that's kind of vision from eye to brain in a nutshell. There are a
bunch of different stations in the brain that do different things.
That's eyesight. Now, I want to talk about the other aspect of vision,
which is the stuff that you don't perceive, the subconscious stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=1680"&gt;Subconscious Vision: Light, Mood, Metabolism, Dopamine; Frog’s Skin In Your Eyes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, we'll transition directly into how you can use light and
eyesight to control this other stuff because it's very important and
that other stuff is mood, sleep, and appetite. And there are ways in
which you can use the same protocols that I will describe, in order to
preserve and even enhance your vision, your ability to see things and
consciously perceive them. So the protocols we will describe have a
lot of carry over to both conscious eyesight and to these subconscious
aspects of vision. And I just want you to understand a little bit more
about the science of seeing, of eyesight and vision, and then all the
protocols will make perfect sense. So as amazing as eyesight is, it
actually did not evolve for us to see shapes and colors and motion and
form. The most ancient cells in our eyes, and the reason we have eyes,
is to communicate information about time of day to the rest of the
brain and body. Remember, there's no extraocular photo reception.
There's no way for light information to get to all the cells of your
body, but every cell in your body needs to know if it's night or day.
And I talked a little bit about this on the, in the episodes on sleep,
and this episode is not about sleep. But I want to emphasize that
there is a particular category of retinal ganglion cell, remember the
neurons that connect the retina to the brain, that is involved in a
special kind of vision that has nothing to do with conscious
perception of what's around you, and it's happening right now, it's
happening all the time. These are so-called melanopsin retinal
ganglion cells, named after the opsin that they contain within them.
They are essentially photoreceptors, remember before I said there are
photoreceptors and then these ganglion cells? Well, these melanopsin
cells, as the name suggests, melanopsin, have their own photoreceptor
built inside them. The opsin that they contain is actually very
similar to the melanopsin that is present in the skin of some
amphibians and that causes those amphibians to change their skin color
in different light conditions. So you have, believe it or not, a
little bit of frog skin in your eye, so to speak. Okay, not exactly,
but you essentially have the equivalent of what frogs have on their
skin in your eye. If you are low vision or no vision, as long as you
have retinas, it's very likely you still have these cells, even though
you can't see or you don't see well. These cells, retinal ganglion
cells, communicate to areas of the brain when particular qualities of
light are present in your environment and signal to the brain,
therefore, that it's early day or late in the day. These melanopsin
ganglion cells are sometimes also called intrinsically photosensitive
cells because they behave like photoreceptors. What do these cells
respond to, and why should you care about them? Well, you should care
about them, because they regulate when you'll get sleepy, when you'll
feel awake, how fast your metabolism is, excuse me, your blood sugar
levels, your dopamine levels, and your pain threshold. There are other
factors that impact those things, but they are one of the, if not the
most powerful determinant, of those other things like mood and pain
threshold, sleepiness, wakefulness, et cetera. These melanopsin
ganglion cells have been shown by the Nitz Group, N-I-T-Z, up at
University of Washington, and by Samer Hattar's lab and David Burson's
lab, and a number of other people's labs, Satchin Panda, Prevencio, et
cetera, a number of excellent labs in neuroscience to set the
circadian clock and to respond best to the contrast between blue and
yellow light of the sort that lands on the cells when you view the
sun, when it's a so-called low solar angle, when it's low in the sky,
either in the morning or in the evening, what does all this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=1920"&gt;Blue-Yellow Light, Sunlight; &amp;amp; Protocol 1 For Better Biology &amp;amp; Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means, and here's the first protocol, and you've probably heard me
say this before, but is appropriate to this episode to say it again.
If you are not viewing the sun, sunlight, even through cloud cover,
for two to 10 minutes in the early part of the day, when the sun is
still low in the sky and doing the same thing again in the evening,
you are severely disrupting your sleep rhythms, your mood, your
hormones, your metabolism, your pain threshold, and many other
factors, including your ability to learn and remember information. The
most central and important aspect of our biology, and perhaps our
psychology as well, is to anchor ourselves in time, to know when we
exist. Okay, it sounds a little bit abstract and philosophical, but
it's not. And we don't know time as a real thing because of watches
and clocks. We know time at a biological level, based on where the sun
is and where, which of course is where we are relative to the sun,
because the earth is spinning around. Now, what does this mean for a
protocol? It means, see, get that light in your eyes early in the day,
and anytime you want to be awake. So try and get as much sunlight in
your eyes during the day as you safely can. We'll talk about eye
safety this episode in depth. And the blue light and the contrast of
that blue yellow, remember we don't see blue, this is all
subconscious. This is blue reflections coming off of sunlight. Blue
light, we've been told is so terrible for us, it is absolutely
essential and wonderful for waking up the brain, for triggering all
sorts of positive biological reactions, but it needs to be viewed
early in the day. If you can't see sunlight, because it's the thick
cloud cover of say a, you know, you're in the UK and it's winter, then
artificial lights, especially blue lights, would be very beneficial to
you. We need a lot of this light and its contrast with yellow, in
order to trigger these melanopsin cells, which will then trigger your
circadian clock, which sits above the roof of your mouth, which will
signal every cell in your body, including temperature, rhythms, et
cetera. So first things first, your visual system was not for seeing
faces, motion, et cetera. The most ancient cells in your eye, which
are there right now as we speak, are there to inform your body and
brain about time of day, so you want to get that bright light early in
the day. Absolutely essential, two to 10 minutes, you can download the
light meter app if you want to measure lux. When we, when I explained
how to do that in earlier episodes it got a little convoluted, get
that two to 10 minutes, ideally without sunglasses. Now, here's
another reason to do this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=2100"&gt;Protocol 2: Prevent &amp;amp; Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours Per Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I've never spoken about this before on any podcast, which is that
there have been several studies now in thousands of subjects,
exploring what can be done to prevent myopia, nearsightedness, and
other visual defects. And it turns out, in a series of large clinical
trials, the conclusion has emerged that getting two hours a day of
outdoor time without sunglasses, blue light, this blue light that
everyone has demonized, getting that sunlight during the day for two
hours, even if you're reading other things, and doing other things
outside, has a significant effect on reducing the probability that you
will get myopia, nearsightedness. Now, whether or not that's also due
to the fact that myopia can be caused by viewing things up close to
too much. So if you're indoors, we tend to be looking at things more
closely, right? Unless you have a very large house with walls that are
very far away from you, but the effect does seem to be directly
related to getting sunlight, and not just to the distance that you're
viewing. I'm going to describe this study just briefly, but this is a
second protocol. So we have one protocol about getting sunlight to set
your circadian clocks, meaning wake you up, establish your sleep, will
occur about 12 to 16 hours later, that's all in the sleep episode. But
also to enhance your mood, to enhance your metabolism, to optimize
your hormone levels, and to optimize learning and dopamine levels,
this feel good neuromodulator that's essential to not getting
depressed, et cetera. But now's the second protocol, which is ideally,
and this includes children, as long as they're not very small infants,
ideally, we're all getting two hours of outdoor time, even if there's
cloud cover. Remember, we evolved mostly under outdoor conditions, not
indoor conditions, and no artificial blue light will not replace this
aspect of your visual system and offsetting myopia. So I just want to
briefly describe this study, because it's a very important one, and I
don't think it's discussed often enough. There are many studies
exploring this, but one of the ones I liked the most, looked at 693
students, and a subset of them were encouraged to spend 11 hours a
week outdoors. Okay, so most kids are in school five days a week or
so, so they're spending 11 hours a week outdoors. They are sometimes
reading outdoors. They're not always just playing outdoors, they might
be reading books, et cetera. They used eight different schools. And
the reason they did the study, I probably should have mentioned, is
that myopia, nearsightedness, is a global epidemic. At least, that's
how it was referred to in the study. I don't know who decides what's
an epidemic or not. I think there are thresholds for that. This paper
published in the journal Ophthalmology in 2018 described the fact that
being outdoors for two hours a day could significantly reduce the
probability that these children would develop nearsightedness. And it
turns out based on other studies, that adults who spend two hours a
day outside, that would be reading outside, talking outside. No, it
does not include light coming through the windshield of your car, I'll
explain why in a few moments, offset the formation of myopia. Now,
myopia, or nearsightedness, has to do with the way that the lens
focuses light onto the retina. I don't want to get into a long
description of this now, but basically the lens has bring light to the
retina, not in front of it, not behind it. If it brings light to a
position in front of the retina, then you won't see clearly, you will
need corrective lenses. If it brings light directly to the retina,
then you will see clearly, that should be intuitive why that makes,
why it makes sense. So you might say, well, why would being outside,
getting this blue light or this blue-yellow contrast from sunlight
actually offset myopia? Well, it probably, and I want to emphasize
probably has to do with the fact that these melanopsin ganglion cells,
these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells, are not just
responsible for sleep, and talking to your circadian clock, and that
sort of thing, they also make connections within the retina. They
connect to things like, this is for the aficionados, the ciliary body,
the iris, the muscles and the structures within the eye that actually
move the lens and allow you to adjust your vision to things up close
or far away. And in doing so, they increase or improve the health of
the little tiny muscles within the eye that move the lens. And they
probably, again, this needs a little bit more work, in order to really
tamp down the mechanism. They're probably also involved in bringing
growth factors and blood supply to the muscles and to the neurons that
are responsible for this focusing mechanism within the eye. So
remember, your eye is an optical device. You were born with lenses,
you don't have to use glasses, or maybe you do because you have lenses
in your eyes and those lenses need to move. It's not a rigid lens,
like a glass lens. It's a dynamic lens, and it has little muscles that
pull on it, and squeeze it, and make it thicker or thinner, as you
look at things close and far away, and I'll describe how that works in
a moment. These melanopsin cells and their activation by sunlight,
completely subconsciously, unaware, you're unaware of this, promote
the health of this system within the eye and allow you to offset the
myopia, nearsightedness. In other words, getting outside for two hours
a day, each day, on average, even if there's cloud cover, without
sunglasses on, will allow you to offset the formation of myopia. Now,
you might still form myopia if you have certain structural features or
a genetic basis for that, we will talk about things that you can do as
well. But for everybody, we should be doing this. And that might seem
like a lot, but this is the way that your visual system works. Staying
indoors, just getting artificial light, and looking at things up close
leads to visual defects. Okay, it's a form of kind of like visual
obesity, right? The posture of your visual system, if you will, is
going to be unhealthy if you're just indoors and you're not getting
sunlight early in the day and for at least two hours per day. I want
to talk a little bit more about how our eyes adjust to things that are
close to us or far away. This is an absolutely brilliant consequence
of our nature and our design. And whenever I say nature and design,
people always ask me, you know, what are you really trying to say? Are
you trying to talk about creators? Are you talking about intelligent
design? Look, I want to be very frank with you. I wasn't consulted at
the design phase, and neither were you. And so, that is all very
interesting, but it's not the topic of this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=2520"&gt;Improving Focus: Visual &amp;amp; Mental; Accommodation, Your Pupils &amp;amp; Your Bendy Lens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is clear and what is the topic of this discussion is that the eye
can dynamically adjust where light lands by moving the lens and
changing the shape of the lens in your eye, through a process called
accommodation. And if you understand this process of accommodation,
you not only can enhance the health of your eyes in the immediate and
long-term, but you also can work better. You'll be able to focus
better on physical and mental work. You will be able to concentrate
for longer. And I want to emphasize that so much of our mental focus,
whether or not it's for cognitive endeavors or physical endeavors, is
grounded in where we place our visual focus, okay? What we look at and
our ability to hold our concentration there is critically determining
how we think. So, in other words, if you can hold visual focus, you
can hold mental focus, cognitive focus, but holding visual focus is
challenging, it's tiring, because it requires movement of the lens.
And that movement of the lens requires activation of muscles. And the
activation of muscles, as you know from the physical performance
episodes, if you saw them and even if you don't, is dictated by
neurons. So, what is accommodation? Well, it's actually very simple
and very elegant. And again, this is another case where whenever I
look at this stuff, even though I've been looking at for years,
learning about it for years, it still boggles my mind that we have
these apparati built into our eyes. So, we have lenses in our eyes,
and we have these things called the irises. You know, you're all
familiar with the iris, because you'll see people's pupils get bigger
or smaller, and we intuitively think of eyes as having the pupils. If
you actually draw two circles on a sheet of paper, and you just, they
look like two circles. But if you put little dots in the middle of
them, they look like eyes. Your brain recognizes those as eyes,
because one of the first things you see when you come into this world
are eyes. And actually, if you put the little dots close together,
it'll look kind of wrong, like it's cross-eyed. And if you put them at
different locations within those two dots, of opposing locations,
it'll look google-eyed. And so, your brain is actually filling in all
the face and other information, even emotional information, just based
on this recognition of eyes. And so, there's clearly we know this,
there's real estate deep up in, you know, further up in the brain,
that's responsible for analyzing and recognizing faces and the eyes
and the position of these little things we call irises, and pupils, et
cetera, is really important for how we interpret the status of others.
And that's why it's such a powerful thing just to put two circles and,
you know, move the pupils around on paper. In fact, I want to get into
accommodation, but if you think about it, if one of my pupils was up
there and the other one was down there, one was really big, and one
was really small, that would actually be a sign of pretty severe
damage. If someone gets hit hard on the side of the head, you'll
notice that they shine a light in one eye. You know why they're doing
that? They're actually looking at the other eye. When you shine light
of the eye that pupil constricts to limit the amount of light that
comes in, so it doesn't damage the eye. This also happens when you
walk outside, and it's bright, it constricts, but we have what's
called the consensual pupil reflex. There's a connection deep in the
brainstem, deep back here in the brain near my neck, that connects the
pupil mechanism for the two eyes, and they're looking at the other
eye. And if you shine light in one eye, and that people constricts but
the other one doesn't, there's a good chance there's brainstem damage.
This is what they do on the side of a, you know, football field or a
boxing match, or if someone unfortunately hits their head. So, two
pupils and don't freak out if one pupil is a little bit smaller than
the other, that doesn't necessarily mean brain damage. But if you
suddenly have one pupil bigger than the other, you absolutely want to
go see a neurologist right away. So, the eyes and the pupils are
indicative of things that are happening deep in the brain. Now,
accommodation is our ability to accommodate to things that are up
close here or further away. And the way this works is that the iris,
and the musculature, and a structure called the ciliary body move the
lens. So, when you look far away, okay, when you see things far away,
your lens actually relaxes, it can flatten out. So I want you to think
about this. When you look far away, when it may be anywhere from like
20 feet away from you out to a horizon that's miles or kilometers away
from you, the lens can just relax. It can flatten out. And you'll
notice that it actually is relaxing to look at a horizon. It's
relaxing to look far away. Whereas if I look at something up close to
me like this pen, or my phone, or a computer screen, or this
microphone, it takes effort. You'll sense the effort. Now, some of
that effort is actually eye movements, because you have muscles that
can move your eyes within their sockets. But a lot of the work, quote
unquote, is neural work of the muscles having to move and contract,
such that the lens actually gets thicker, in order to bring the light
to the retina and not to a location in front of it or behind it, so
called accommodation. There's also changes in the size of the pupil,
as things are closer and further away from you. In fact, there's a
simple way to think about this. Healthy pupils are going to dilate
when you look at something far away from you. Now, when you see
something that excites you or stresses you out, your pupils also get
big. Your eyes get wide. But if you look at something far away, your
pupils are going to dilate. And when you look at things that are
closer to you, when you move them up close, the pupils are going to
shrink. That's all part of this accommodation mechanism. Now, you
might say, why are you telling me about accommodation? This is crazy.
Why are you telling me about this? Well, these days we're spending a
lot of time looking at things, mainly our phones up close, and
computers up close, and we are indoors. If you are a young person, and
even if you are 25 or older, and you are spending a lot of time
looking at things up close, and you are not allowing your vision to
relax. In other words, you are not giving your lens the opportunity to
flatten out, and for these muscles to relieve themselves of this work,
you may or may not have migraine headaches. You may or may not have
headaches. You might, and that could be the cause of those. But you
are also training your eyes to be good at looking at things up close
and not far away, and as a consequence, you are reshaping the neural
circuitry in your brain, and it is not good. It is not healthy to only
look at things up close. Now, there are a lot of recommendations out
there right now, especially with all the lockdowns of the last, you
know, 12 to 18 months that people should look up from Zoom every once
in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=2930"&gt;Protocol 3: Distance Viewing For 20min For Every 90 Minutes of “Close Viewing”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe now, I'm hearing that people should take calls instead of
doing Zoom, where you should look up from your computer screen. It's
actually not going to solve the problem, just to look up from your
computer screen. You need to go to a window. You need to look out at a
distance. Ideally, you would even open the window, because those
windows actually filter out a lot of the blue light that you want
during the daytime. A lot of the sunlight, it's actually 50 times less
gets through. You want to get out onto a balcony. You want to relax
your eyes and look out at the horizon. You want to go into what's
called panoramic vision, and let your vision expand. You want this
lens mechanism to be very elastic. You don't want it to get stuck in
that configuration of looking at things up close. Accommodation is a
wonderful feature of your visual system, but you don't want to push
that too hard, too often, or for too long. You want to view the
horizon. You want to get outside, not just to lighten the load on your
mind, or to think about other things, but to maintain the health of
your visual system. In other words, you want to exercise these muscles
and that involves both the lens moving and getting kind of thicker and
relaxing that lens. And the relaxation of the lens is actually one of
the best things you can do for the musculature of the inner eye. So
what's the protocol, how often should you do this? You might be
surprised, but for every 30 minutes of focused work, you probably want
to look up every once in a while and just try and relax your face and
eye muscles, including your jaw muscles, because all these things are
closely linked in the brainstem and allow your eyes to go into a so-
called panoramic vision, where you're just not really focusing on
anything and then refocus on your work. At least every 90 minutes of
looking at things up close, or even if you're looking at a screen, you
know, television screen, or you're watching a movie, or you're
indoors, for every 90 minutes of that, you ideally would have at least
20, probably more like 30 minutes of being outside, ideally. But if
you can't be outside, of non up-close vision. And you might say,
that's impossible, how am I supposed to do that? You know, I'm in an
office or I'm in a building. Get to a window, get outside if you can
do it safely, get onto a balcony, and just let your eyes relax. Many
people are experiencing severe vision problems, because they're not
getting enough sunlight during the day. They have sleep problems,
because they're not viewing sunlight early in the day. And as I've
mentioned in previous episodes, they're getting a lot of artificial
stimulation, artificial light stimulation, of the eye in the middle of
the night, all of this is through the visual system. So migraines,
fatigue, challenges with your eyesight getting worse as you age, or
even in young people, there's a, you know, at least according to the
articles, they describe it as this epidemic of myopia can largely be
dealt with by getting outside, going into panoramic vision,
experiencing some distanced vision, look at things off in the horizon.
If you're walking or hiking or biking, not looking at your phone the
whole time that you're doing that. If you're at the bus stop or you're
commuting, certainly not looking at your phone the entire time you're
doing that. So this is vital. And I want to emphasize another
protocol, though I don't want to get into it in too much depth, 'cause
I want to make sure that I also talk about a number of other important
aspects of the visual system that are more related to sight, but
getting into optic flow is very important for de-stressing your
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=3140"&gt;Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Yourself Through Space Daily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you move through space, whether or not it's through walking,
biking, even swimming, if it's self-generated optic flow, so probably
not driving or motorcycling, but yes, bicycling or I don't know,
unicycling. I don't know why I thought about unicycling. There used to
be a graduate student at Stanford who was a really impressive
unicycler, those are pretty rare. As long as it's self-generated optic
flow, meaning you're generating motion of your body and the visual
images around you are passing by on your eyes, that is very good for
the visual system. And it's very good for the mood systems and the
neuromodulator systems of the brain and body that regulate mood. This
is well-established. So I'm not telling people to get away from their
phone and their computers. I spend a lot of time staring at a page,
drawing, writing, texting, et cetera, just like you do, but we're
really talking about some very simple protocols that aren't just
designed to improve your sleep, but are really designed to bolster and
enhance your vision. And of course, because it's this podcast, we will
also talk about things that you can take to improve your vision. But
if your visual behavior isn't right, and I do believe we should always
start with behaviors, and then think about nutrition, supplementation,
et cetera, if your behaviors around vision aren't right, you cannot
expect to have good, healthy eyesight for a long time, meaning
throughout your lifespan. And if your vision is already poor, many of
these things that I'm talking about today, perhaps all of them, will
improve your vision to some degree. And if your vision is starting to
go, then doing these behaviors is likely to really enhance the quality
of the vision that you will build and maintain over time. And all of
these are essentially zero cost, okay? If you live in a very dark
environment, like a cave or outer space, it's going to be hard to do
some of this stuff. But if you're on planet earth, even if there's
cloud cover, chances are you can do some, or most, or even all of
these some, most, or all days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=3266"&gt;Protocol 5: Be More Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Up Versus Down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm about to describe next is going to seem so silly on the face
of it, but has deep mechanism to support it. Put simply, when you get
tired, your eyelids close, and when you're alert, your eyelids are
open. That is because you have neurons in your brain, that depending
on your level of alertness, will make it easy or hard to keep your
eyes open. Now, that's a complete duh, except that we don't often
think about the relationship between alertness and where we are
looking and our eyelids. Now, I learned this from a colleague of mine
in psychiatry, who happens to work on hypnosis. I'm not going to
hypnotize you right now. That's actually for a future episode. But
what happens when we get tired? Our eyelids close, and our chin moves
down. We tend to nod out this way. If you have ever been in a
classroom, certainly not one of mine, but if you've been in a
classroom and the lecturer is kind of drawing on, or it's the
afternoon, what you'll notice is that a number of students, their
heads are jolt, kind of their eyelids are closing, and their chin is
dropping, and they, you'll see a bunch of heads bouncing back up,
right? I was definitely one of those people in class. If it was post-
lunch in the afternoon, it's warm, the hum of the air conditioner, or
whatever it is, and I'm just out, okay? When we're wide awake, the
opposite happens. Our eyelids are open all the way, and our chin
happens to be up. And no, this is not me telling you to have good
posture. However, what I learned from my colleague at Stanford is that
these circuits actually act in loops. When we look up, maybe it's
because these melanopsin cells are in the bottom of our retina, they
are, and maybe it's because they're there in order to view sunlight,
which is overhead, which it is, but that system of alertness is linked
to the position of our eyes. So when we look up and our eyelids are
up, it actually has a purpose. It actually creates a wakefulness
signal for the brain. And so, while this might seem like the silliest
and simple tool that I might ever describe on this podcast, if you are
feeling tired, it actually can be beneficial to the wakefulness
systems of the brain, including the locus coeruleus and these areas
that release norepinephrine to actually look up, to actually look up
toward the ceiling. You don't want your chin all the way back, but to
look up and to raise your eyes toward the ceiling and to look up and
try and hold that for 10 to 15 seconds. So this isn't looking up and
closing your eyes, like on a nice sunny day, that's relaxing. This is
looking up and actually looking up at the ceiling. It actually
triggers some of the areas of the brain that are involved in
wakefulness. So if you're somebody who's falling asleep at your work,
this can be very beneficial. Likewise, many people are looking at
their phone all day, and their chin is down, and then they're sitting
at a computer that's positioned below them, and they're having trouble
staying awake or focusing. It can be very, I tell Costello this all
the time, 'cause he's always falling asleep while he's trying to do
his work, positioning your computer screen up at eye level, or
sometimes having it actually above eye level, can actually create
wakefulness and alertness for the work that you're going to do. This
is simply because of this connection between the brainstem circuits
and the other neural circuits that control wakefulness and eyelids
opening and looking up. Okay, so it, again, it's remarkably simple,
almost laughably simple, but it's grounded in some of the most
hardwired, meaning present from birth, aspects of our neural
circuitry. And norepinephrine released from locus coeruleus isn't just
a mouthful, it's a really interesting and powerful mechanism for how
the rest of the brain wakes up. Locus coeruleus hoses the rest of your
brain with norepinephrine, in order to wake up those circuits for work
and attention. And so, eyes up is actually a way, a route into
increased alertness. Eyes down is a route into sleepiness, into
reduced alertness. And I have only one friend that texts up here, like
on the street holds his phone up here. It looks ridiculous. And yet,
you know, if we were trying to create more sense of alertness, if
that's your goal, positioning computer screens up high, chin up,
looking up if you need to kind of create an alertness signal, not
always being chin down and texting, or working into typewriters, or
reading below us. is actually going to send a recurring wakefulness
signal. When things are up, we tend to be alert. When everything's
focused down, including our eyes, it tends to have a more suppressive
or sedative type signaling to the deeper centers of the brain. Now,
before we move on to the science, and tools,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=3561"&gt;Protocol 6: Sleep In A Very Dark Room To Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and protocols related to pattern vision, I want to mention another
study that was done by the University of Pennsylvania. They have a
terrific group there that works on sleep. They made an important
discovery that I think everybody should know about, which is that
children that sleep in rooms that have a nightlight or dim lights are
much more likely to develop myopia, nearsightedness. Conversely,
children that sleep in very dark rooms, so either very dim nightlights
or complete black, they have a much lower, statistically speaking, a
significantly lower probability of developing myopia, nearsightedness.
Now, why is that? It's because the wavelengths of light that matter
for these melanopsin cells, oftentimes can get through the eyelids.
And that's particularly true for children and people that have thin
eyelids. Some people, like me, have very thin eyelids. I've been told
this before. Not many people touch my eyelids, but among those that
have, I have very thin eyelids. I notice I have very thin eyelids
compared to say, Costello. Now, Costello's eyes droop. He can't even
close his eyes all the way they're so droopy. But many people have
thin eyelids, and those people are going to be even more prone to
light coming in through the eyelid. So for parents, for kids, and for
adults, you really want to try to get to a place where you can sleep
in a completely black or dark environment. One little exposure to
light, no big deal. But this ties back to the other protocol that I've
described before in the mood and sleep episodes, which is that viewing
light, even a very low intensity between the hours of 10:00 PM and
4:00 AM is extremely detrimental to the dopamine and other mood
producing systems of the brain. It can negatively impact learning, and
immunity, and even blood sugar, and make people type two diabetes
prone by way of communication from these melanopsin cells to a
structure in the brain called the habenula. Why am I throwing out all
this verbiage? Well, because people have asked for more mechanisms.
So, if you really want to know, when you look at blue light or if blue
light is getting in through your eyelids in the middle of the night,
it is likely distorting this lens accommodation mechanism in the eye
and leading to myopia in some cases. So, that's one reason to avoid
blue light exposure and bright light exposure, even nightlight
exposure, in middle of the night. Viewing any light of bright
intensity between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM on a consistent
basis is going to suppress dopamine, because of the way that that
light activates these melanopsin cells, and the habenula, and the
dopamine system. So it's all very simple, get as much bright light as
you can safely, right? You never want to look at any light so bright
that it's painful look at, during the daytime. Try and go without
sunglasses, unless you need them. Now, I wear sunglasses for sake of
sport and sake when it's really bright out, but I try to get two hours
a day of working outside or being outside, even if there's cloud
cover, that's going to offset myopia. It's going to help you get
better sleep. It's going to support mood and metabolism, et cetera.
And at night, if you're sleeping with a lot of lights in the room, and
especially, if there are kids that need a nightlight, you should try
and wean them off that nightlight, because it's going to be beneficial
for their vision to wean them off that nightlight and put them into a
darker environment. Obviously, you want to get them emotionally
comfortable with that first. Now, let's talk about pattern vision,
actual seeing things, like faces and colors, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=3775"&gt;Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm presuming that some of you out there are colorblind. We can all
help the red-green colorblind folks out there by not using red in
slides and diagrams, and on menus, and things of that sort. Try and
use magenta instead. They can see the contrast between magenta and
green better than if there's red and green. So, be kind to the
colorblind folks out there. It's actually a fair percentage. And there
are a lot of different kinds of colorblind. I should just mention some
people are true monochromats. They see the world in black and white.
That's exceedingly rare. Most colorblind people, colorblind in quotes,
are red-green colorblind, meaning they lack red cone photo pigment,
meaning they can't see long wavelengths of light. So they see the
world much as a canine or a cat does, where they don't get the green-
red contrast. That's why we call it red-green colorblind. They have
the green cones, but they can't do the contrast comparison that I
described at the beginning of the episode. So use magenta, and they
will be able to see things. You wonder why stop signs and stop lights
and things aren't in magenta. Well, because the world is unkind to the
red-green color blind individuals, and they have to learn the position
of those lights in the street lights. And they have to learn the
shapes of signs, which they can do readily, and it usually says stop
on it as well. But if you care about colorblind folks, which I do,
then we could all do them a service by, I think by law actually in the
U.S., menus are required to be colorblind accessible. How can you
improve your vision? How can you get better at seeing things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=3872"&gt;Protocol 7: Keeping Your Vision Sharp With Distance Viewing Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one way is to make sure that you spend at least 10 minutes a day
total, at least, viewing things off in the distance. So that would be
well over half a mile or more, try and see a horizon, try and get your
vision out to a location that's beyond the four walls of your house or
apartment, or the doors of your car, and the windshield of your car. I
know that can be hard to do, but it's very valuable. If you live in a
city like New York and it's skyscrapers everywhere, you've probably
experienced the incredible sense of relaxation, and it's aesthetically
beautiful, when you are walking down one of these long avenues, and
you turn, and I think they have a name for this in New York, where the
sunset is suddenly visible along a long avenue between some
skyscrapers. And it's just very relaxing to be able, suddenly, to see
at a distance, and that's actually because this eye mechanism of
relaxing the lens and relaxing some of the musculature around the eyes
sends signals deep into the brainstem that release some of the centers
that are involved in alertness, AKA stress. And it's very pleasant for
a reason. It's not a, it's not a placebo effect if you will. There are
a bunch of neurochemicals and things that are associated with that. So
try and see at a distance, because it's good for your eyesight. It'll
keep this lens nice and elastic, and the muscles nice and strong that
move the lens, and it has this relaxing component to it. Now, our
visual system is exquisitely tuned to motion,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=3965"&gt;Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not just our self-generated motion, but the motion of things around
us. And one of the things that it does is something called smooth
pursuit. Smooth pursuit is our ability to track individual objects
moving, as the name suggests, smoothly through space in various
trajectories. You can actually train or improve your vision by looking
at smooth pursuit stimuli, and that sounds really boring. What you can
do is, and I'll provide a link to some that I think are pretty good
that are used in various clinics, ophthalmology and optometry clinics.
You can actually take a few minutes each day, or maybe if you don't do
it each day, you could every third day or so, and actually just
visually track a ball. Sometimes it's moving in and kind of an
infinity symbol. Sometimes it's more of a sawtooth. Sometimes it's
changing speed. Sometimes the cue that you're following, the little
target, is dilating and contracting. This is going to keep the
muscles, I want to be clear, this is going to keep the extraocular
muscles conditioned and strong and allow you to have a healthy smooth
pursuit system. Remember, the brain follows the eye. It follows the
movements of the eye. It has to deal with that. And the neural
circuits within the brain have to cope with changes in smooth pursuit.
So if you're doing a lot of reading up close, you're not viewing
horizons, you're not getting a lot of smooth pursuit type stimulation
from your life, or you're just getting it within the confines of a
little box on your phone, like your smooth pursuit is over, you know,
millimeters or what we always talk in terms of visual angle, but the
amount of degrees of visual angle. But if you're just looking at
smooth pursuit in this little tiny box on your phone, or on your
computer screen, and you're not looking at objects in your environment
like swooping birds and things like that, which I'm guessing many of
you are not spending your time doing, well, these mechanisms for
smooth pursuit will get worse over time. Your vision will get worse.
And so, while I prefer that people get out into the real world and
experience smooth pursuit tracking of visual objects, I don't know,
maybe it's a good reason to go to a hockey game or, you know, and try
and keep your eye on the puck, which I can never seem to do. It moves
so fast. Or I guess this is a good reason to watch live sports if
that's your thing, or to watch a tennis match, like a cat, like a
kitten, watching the ball go back and forth, whatever, watching kids
play, it doesn't really matter. The idea is that you want to use the
visual system regularly for what it was designed for, and smooth
pursuit is a great way to keep the visual and motion tracking systems
of the brain and the eye and the extraocular muscles working in a
really nice coordinate fashion. I would say five to 10 minutes, three
times a week will be great. If you care about your vision, you can
train your vision in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=4128"&gt;Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times a Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one is to train accommodation. There are a lot of videos out
there, I want to be clear, on the internet, some of which are from
clinicians, some of which are not. Some of which are from scientists,
some of which are from other sources, talking about things you can do
to make your vision better, to improve your vision. Most of those are
geared toward improving the extraocular eye muscles, but I did consult
with our chair of ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, Jeff
Goldberg, who's an MD and a PhD, a phenomenal scientist, and a
phenomenal clinician, and incidentally, a phenomenal chairman as well,
about what sorts of things, tools, are actually beneficial for pattern
vision and sight, because there's just so much out there on the
internet. Not all of which is accurate or good, frankly. And he agreed
that a smooth pursuit stimulus, that kind of training, as well as, or
exercise, as well as near far. So spending a few minutes, you might
even just do this for two minutes of looking at something up close,
that's going to activate these accommodation mechanisms, and then
moving it at arms length, and focusing on it for five, 10 seconds,
maybe more, maybe 15 or 20 seconds, then slowly moving it into a
location, and then out. This is actually a lot like the visual
training that's done post-concussion to try and repair, actually
repair some of the balance, and motor, and visual, and cognitive
aspects of the brain. And we are going to have a guest on at a future
time that, to deal with concussion and some post-concussion training.
A lot of post concussion recovery and training centers around the
visual system. Not just because people are trying to recover their
vision and their sense of balance, but because, as I mentioned
earlier, the brain's ability to make sense of its environment, and the
brain's ability to parse time, not just on the day-night schedule, but
also shorter time intervals, follows the visual system. Something
we'll turn to a little bit more at the end. So what does this mean?
The tool is, spend two to three minutes doing smooth pursuit. There's
some programs on YouTube, or you can just look up smooth pursuit
stimulus, and I'll provide a link to a couple I like as well. You
could do this with a pen if you wanted. You could do this. Someone
else could hold a wand, and you could do that, if you've got someone
that can do that for you. Practice accommodation for a few minutes,
maybe every other day, just bringing something in close. You'll feel
the strain of your eyes doing that. I can feel it right now, move it
out. You'll feel a relaxation point. Move it past that relaxation
point, where you will have to do what's called the vergence eye
movement to maintain focus on that location as it moves out, bring it
back in. At the point where you actually have to go cross-eyed, this
will differ for different people, depending on how far apart your eyes
are, so called interpupillary distance. So for me, I have been teased
before, I have a very short interpupillary distance. I'm not a
cyclops, but I'm heading there. Some people are more walleyed, like a
flounder. Well, depending on your interpupillary distance, the point
at which things get blurry and cross-eyed will vary. But for me, you
know, as I get about, oh gosh, I guess it's about six inches from my
nose. It's really hard, I can't accommodate any longer. I move it out
another inch, and everything's in nice focus. Try and see whether or
not you can get things closer. Now, you don't want to get cross-eyed.
Remember what your parents told you, or my parents told me, that if
you cross your eyes, when you're young, that they can stay that way.
Actually, they won't necessarily stay that way, but your brain can
start losing information and the ability to see binocular depth,
something we'll talk about in a moment. But for now, the protocol
would be, you know, two to three, maybe five minutes, just practice
that, practice accommodation, and then be sure to give your eyes some
rest, get outside, look at a horizon, or do nothing, just kind of let
your eyes go soft. I guess what the yogis would call soft gaze. Just
kind of relax your eyelids, not this, not eyes closed. Just relaxed,
panoramic vision, try and see the walls around you without moving your
head. Exercise your eye muscles, exercise the accommodation mechanisms
of your eyes, practice a little bit of smooth pursuit. You don't have
to be neurotic about this, but if you do this often enough, meaning
every other day, every third day or so, you can be the strange person
on the plane or in the classroom doing this. You know, that people
might chuckle or look at you funny, or tease you, but that's okay,
because you'll be able to see when they are losing their vision, so
you'll get the last laugh. Please don't laugh at them, but maybe you
can help them. At that point, you can hold the pen for them. It's
worth doing. It's really worth preserving your vision. And again, if
you're a young person, this is great, because then you can actually
build an extra strong visual system, using all the tools that we're
describing. I do want to talk about a new set of findings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=4413"&gt;Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol To Improve Photoreceptors &amp;amp; Vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that are related to red light and offsetting age-related macular
degeneration. There are a lot of ways in which our visual system gets
worse over time, but one is so called age-related macular
degeneration. Glen Jeffrey at the University College London, somebody
I've known for decades as a, because he's a scientist, has done
beautiful work on development and function of the visual system, has
published a number of papers recently, one that got a particularly
high amount of attention in the press was one that showed that
flashing red light into the eyes early in the day, not late in the
day, early in the day, can help offset some age-related macular
degeneration, presumably by enhancing the mitochondrial function in
the photoreceptors. There does seem to be some evidence for that.
Although, it's still early days, I want to emphasize you don't want to
shine really bright lights into your eyes. You never want to look at
any light that's so bright that it's painful, and you never want to
force your eyelids to stay open. If you need to close your eyes in
order to be comfortable, well, then chances are that light is too
bright. But doing just a couple minutes a day, like two minutes a day
of flashing this red light into one eye, and then the other. As long
as it was early in the day before noon time, and as long as it was in
individuals that were 40 years or older, did seem to have a
significant effect in offsetting some of the age-related macular
degeneration that would otherwise occur. Again, these are early
findings. If you want to do this, please be careful. Please talk to
your optometrist and/or ophthalmologist. Your eyesight is precious.
You don't want to damage it, but it is interesting. And it does seem
like red light can improve the function of the mitochondria. These
photoreceptors have a lot of mitochondria, the energy-producing
organelles within the cells, because they are some of the most
metabolically active cells in your entire body. Your photoreceptors
are active all the time as you're looking around, and even when your
eyes are closed, they're active. In fact, through a weird twist of the
biology, and please look this up if you're really interested in this,
your photoreceptors are actually most active in the dark. This is so
weird. It's a twist of biology, the way the system's arranged, that
when light comes on, they shut off their activity. So actually whether
or not you see something in front of you, like this pen or my face, is
because the way your photoreceptors are turning off not turning on.
It's a really cool twist, and I don't want to go too far down that
rabbit hole, but check it out if you're interested in how
photoreceptors work. It's an absolutely incredible literature. Just
Google, excuse me, look up on the web. We are not partial just to
Google. I happen to use Google, but use your web browser to look up
photoreceptors hyperpolarization site. And you can learn a lot about
that, if you're a real nerd for this stuff, like I am. Okay, so red
light to the eye, can perhaps, it seems, help maintain vision, doing
smooth pursuit exercises, and accommodation near-far exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=4580"&gt;Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people suffer from poor eyesight, simply because their eyes get
dry. There are incredible, believe it or not, lubricating mechanisms
for the eye, not just tears, but a thin sheet of oil. I mean, it's
just amazing. Unless you have some sort of corneal abrasion, the
cornea is the clear stuff on the outside of your eye, corneal
abrasion, when you blink, it's smooth, you don't feel it. It's just
really, really smooth. And yet, if you've ever had a corneal scratch,
I've had this, it's really rough, it is so painful. You have a ton of
pain receptors in the cornea. The lubrication of the cornea is
supported by blinking. And while it seems a little silly, some people
actually benefit from doing some, you know, five or 10 or 15 seconds
of blinking, and then doing their focused work. Some people, their
eyes are drying out, because as we focus, if we're trying to do
something, our eyelids stay open, the eyes can dry out, but it also
can make it such, that when we blink the next time, there's a kind of
a need to focus, because there's some distortions in these oils and
liquids across the corneal surface. If you're somebody who suffers
from dry eye, I do hope they'll find a treatment or a cure for dry eye
soon. There isn't one at present. Someone stands to make a lot of
money out there if you can find a cure for dry eye. Let the companies
know or start a company, right now it's still a mystery as to how to
do that. But blinking for five 15 seconds, probably slowly, not as
quickly as I'm doing here on video, but just, you know, maybe a blink
every a second or two for 15 seconds can lubricate the eyes. And
that's not directly related to anything neural, it's just going to
allow the optics of your eye to be clear. Just like when the screen of
your phone gets dirty, like when Costello's texting on my phone, and I
pick it up, and it's like covered with smudge, to clean it off in
order to see things clearly, the same thing is happening for these
optical devices on the front of your brain. Remember, these are brain.
Okay, so a lot of protocols today, almost all of them behavioral
protocols. I do want to talk a little bit more about vision and how it
works internally. And then I also want to talk about some of the foods
and supplements that have been shown to support vision and offset
visual loss, and maybe even reverse some visual loss. Let's talk about
binocular vision and lazy eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=4720"&gt;Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity; Protocol 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very familiar with lazy eye, because when I was a kid, I went
swimming one day, one day, and I didn't have my goggles. And so,
something must have been happening, as I recall, with the eye moving
down through the water, I've always had this problem that I can only
do the freestyle stroke off to one side. The people I swim with are
always laughing. Somehow, I kind of move toward drowning when I try
and breathe on the right side. I think there's some asymmetry in the
way I'm organized. Anyway, I was off to my left, and my eye kept going
in and out of the water, and there was chlorine in the water, and it
was making my own uncomfortable, so I just closed my eye. I just
decided, you know, I knew more or less how to swim straight-ish.
Might've bounced off the lane lines a few times, but I just use the
other eye to kind of steer for that mark on the wall. Got out of the
pool, took a shower, dried off, and then completely lost by binocular
vision for three days, completely. The young brain, up until about age
seven, but maybe even extending out until about age 12 is extremely
vulnerable to differences in ocular input between the two eyes. My
scientific great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize for discovering so
called critical periods, periods of time in which the brain is more
plastic, more able to change. Those two guys, David Hubel and Torsten
Wiesel, thank you, David and Torsten, forever changed the face of
visual neuroscience and forever changed the way we think about
treatment of the young brain. It used to be thought that you wouldn't
want to do a surgery on a young kid, because of risk of anesthesia in
young individuals. But we now know that you need to repair these
imbalances, that even a few hours, okay, I don't want to scare
anybody, I'll talk about reversal. But a few hours of occluding one
eye early in life can lead to permanent, unless something's done,
permanent changes in the way that the brain perceives the outside
world, such that when that eye is opened up again, the brain actually
can't make sense of anything that's coming through it. It shuts down
that visual pathway somehow. So what happened to me was, I actually
was, my eye was fine. I got out of the pool, I opened my eye, but I
couldn't see through that eye. Everything was blurry, double vision,
unless I covered this eye, and then I could see perfectly fine.
Fortunately, I went to an ophthalmologist who understood the
literature. Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie, who understood the literature
and made it clear that what I needed to do was to occlude the other
eye, the eye that was working very well. Clearly, he understood the
work of you Huber and Wiesel. Now, again, you don't want to start
playing games with this kind of stuff when you're a kid. If you wear,
let's say you have a Halloween costume and you wear an eye patch,
you're a pirate or something for Halloween, and you cover it up on one
side, probably for the night of Halloween, it's okay. I do not
recommend doing that recreationally if you don't need that if you're a
young child or for your child to do that. Because, indeed, you create
imbalances in the brain machinery that compares information coming in
through the two eyes, and it can shut down the neural information for
the occluded, the closed eye. Now, I was able to reverse this issue,
but my binocular vision has never been terrific. I'm much better at
the dart board and still not very good if I close one eye. I'm much
better at the pool table, if I close one eye, and I still am terrible.
I was the kid in, you know, in the outfield. You know, the ball is
coming towards me, the ball's coming towards me, I'm going to catch
the ball, and like it hit me square in the lip. My binocular vision
isn't great as a consequence of this early event. And I have a hard
time with those binocular stereograms, those images that are kind of,
you're supposed to look at them, and then the binocular depth image
like pops out. All the other kids were going, oh, there's the,
whatever, the Statue of Liberty. There's the [inaudible], and I see
dots. Okay, so I have binocular vision, but I use other cues. I use
the near-far cues that I talked about before. Motion parallax, the
fact that things are closer to me are moving faster than things
further away, in order to judge depth. And years later, when I got
involved in, and I don't suggest this for most people, I got involved
in boxing and martial arts when I was younger. You sometimes will see
fighters, this is a slip to avoid getting punched. It's also
generating motion parallax. Many animals judge depth by moving their
head, not by using other mechanisms of accommodation, okay? So a lot
of birds and monkeys and animals will judge depth by moving their head
like this, or they'll move from side to side. Animals that will
undulate sometimes are actually doing a depth measurement, because as
you move from side to side, the brain is able to do the math of depth.
So what does this all mean in terms of protocols? If you're a young
person, do your best to get really good binocular vision, not just at
level of your phone or your tablet, but also at distance, you will
build strong binocular visual machinery in the brain and at the level
of the eyes and the eye musculature. Now, if you're somebody who did
have an occlusion, what's needed is to cover up the other eye to
create an imbalance, so that the weak eye, the so-called lazy eye,
this is sometimes referred to as amblyopia, that eye has to work
harder. So for me, they patched this other eye and made this eye,
eventually, I got vision through that eye back. then they opened them
both up. Now, you might ask, what happens if you cover both eyes early
in life? And this is where it gets interesting. You might think, well,
if covering one eye leads to poor vision for that eye after that eye
is open, covering both eyes will probably make you blind, right?
Actually, that's not what happens. What Hubel and Wiesel discovered
and what's been affirmed many, many more times over in subsequent
studies is that it's competitive, that the two eyes are competing for
real estate up in the brain. So if you actually cover both eyes, you
actually extend the period of critical plasticity. This is a really
interesting aspect that other people are starting to leverage now, in
terms of how to reopen plasticity later in life. But please don't, you
know, go around with your eyes covered for too long. There are some
like retreats and stuff where people go into caves with absolutely no
vision. It creates hallucinations. We'll talk about why that is in
just a moment, but here's my suggestion. Try and get balanced visual
input through the two eyes. Almost everybody has a dominant eye. It
usually doesn't relate to your dominant hand, although it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=5088"&gt;Protocol 12: Determine Your Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so for me, if I cover up my right eye, I see much less well, much
more poorly. It's a little bit fuzzy, and I have to work harder in
order to see the camera for instance. Then, if I cover up my left eye,
it's actually really easy for me to relax. I have a dominant eye. Now,
you can balance that out by covering up the dominant eye a little bit
each day, but I would warn any young people, meaning, you know, 12 or
younger, against creating these imbalances if there isn't a clinical
need to do that. And if you do have strong imbalances between the two
eyes, which can be caused by cataract and lens issues, can be caused
by neuromuscular issues, et cetera, to try and get those dealt with as
early as possible by contacting a really good ophthalmologist and
ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist. It is very normal, I should say, it's
very common for young children, babies to have an eye that, with
strabismus, that either deviates out or that deviates in. It is
important to correct that. If you would like to have balanced division
between the two eyes and for the brain to respond equally to the two
eyes and to have, I would say high fidelity, quality vision. Although
some people who have an eye that drifts can function normally in life,
you have an opportunity early in life to rescue that. I won't do,
well, maybe I will do this, but I can actually relax this eye. It's so
weak, in some cases, that it actually can start to deviate. Here, I'll
just do this here. It's not crossing my eyes. So I actually can move
my, I can misalign my eyes, because I have to fight very hard to have
the musculature for this eye, keep that eye aligned with the other
eye. And that's because I've been doing eye exercises, since I was in
my twenties, 'cause I noticed when I would study a lot, this eye would
start to drift in, I'd start to see double, and I would then, next
thing you know, I was just covering the eye up, and it was getting
weaker and weaker, just like the atrophy of a muscle. So I went to the
doctor, what did they do? They did the exact wrong thing. The
optometrist I went to gave me a prism, which adjusted it so that I
could see things normally, which just made the eye weaker and weaker.
It's like putting a weak arm into a sling. So I had to spend at least
three years of 10 minutes a day, is what I recommend, doing near-far,
covering up my good eye, doing near-far with my bad eye. And now, it's
been about 10, 12 years that I have pretty decent binocular vision.
Now, many of you aren't dealing with this, or have these early
childhood issues. Some of you might be experiencing challenges with
fatigued eyes or with differences in focus with the two eyes. These
eye exercises of near-far, smooth pursuit, and checking for dominant
and non-dominant eye can be very beneficial. I'm again, I'm not a
clinician, so I don't want to, you know, give you protocols or enforce
protocols on anybody. You need to figure out what's right and safe for
you, given your vision history. I do recommend talking to a really
good ophthalmologist if you have severe vision problems of any kind,
or if you want to offset vision problems of any kind. An optometrist
as well, but ideally would be a neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, I did
mention hallucinations, and they're fun to talk about and think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=5277"&gt;Visual Hallucinations: The Consequence of An Under-Active Visual Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for years, people have asked, why do people get visual
hallucinations. Costello's in sleep right now, you can probably hear
him snoring, he's snoring so loud. He's probably having hallucinations
about rabbits, pizza, and those are mainly his favorite, and sleep.
He's dreaming about sleep in sleep. Hallucinations are a property of
the visual system, and it was always thought that hallucinations
arise, because of over-activation or activation of certain aspects of
the visual system. I just briefly want to mention a paper that was
published by my good friend and phenomenal scientist and physicist for
that matter, Cris Niell who's up at the University of Oregon in
Eugene. They studied LSD light compounds and discovered that
hallucinations actually occur, because portions of your brain become
underactive. The visual portions of your brain are under-stimulated.
This is probably why, when people go into these cave retreats,
something I've never done, I don't think I ever will do, where it's
completely black, pretty soon, they start hallucinating. They start
seeing things, even though there's nothing there. The visual system is
desperate to make guesses about what's out in the world. It's like the
eager beaver of your brain. It's like, what's out there, what's out
there, what's out there? Even in low to no vision people, blind
people, they are, their brain is going to be making guesses about
what's out there in the auditory world. What sounds are there? What
touch sensations are there? For sighted folks, it's going to be,
what's out there in terms of light? Light is the dominant way. Vision
is the dominant way that we evaluate the world around us. So it turns
out that hallucinations are an under-activation of the visual system,
and then a compensatory, a compensation, by which the visual system
creates activity and hallucinations. So if you're in the dark long
enough, you start to hallucinate and see things. So, that's a little
note about hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=5387"&gt;Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: A Simple, Cost-Free Way To Test &amp;amp; Maintain Vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that you can do to improve your vision, and it's
also kind of fun is to put a Snellen chart in your home. A Snellen
chart is that list of letters. Or if you go to the dreaded Department
of Motor Vehicles, actually I'm up for renewal soon, so I love the
Department of Motor Vehicles. The Department of Motor Vehicles,
they'll have you cover up an eye, read the letters on the chart, the
letters of course gets smaller and smaller, they're trying to figure
out roughly what your vision is. Cover up the other eye, you'll do
that. Some people including nerdy, vision scientists like me have had
Snellen charts in their office or in their home for many years now,
and you can just practice, and you can see how you're doing sitting at
a particular distance. Your, this is something that's not often
mentioned, but your performance on the Snellen chart will vary
depending on time of day, because your level of fatigue and your
ability to control that accommodation and other mechanisms of the eye
muscles will vary, so you can take it as an average. It's also a good
thing, if you're going to get your vision tested for corrective
lenses, or maybe you're going to do laser surgery, or something of
that sort, if you're thinking about any of that, to really get it
measured by a professional. The ones that you get in those
supermarkets, or in many eyeglass stores, apologies to the eyeglass
stores, are often wrong by an order of magnitude. And then, when you
start putting corrective lenses on that are over-correcting or under-
correcting, but more often are over-correcting, well, then you're
essentially weakening the system. It's like putting a prosthetic on a
limb that you didn't necessarily need, or robot arm when you didn't
need the use of the robot arm. Although now there's so much excitement
about robots, I think people are going to be doing that anyway.
Nonetheless, get your vision tested by somebody who really understands
vision, like an ophthalmologist or a really good optometrist. If you
put a Snellen chart in your home, you know, you can do that as part of
your visual training. Now, this might seem excessively nerdy, but what
is more important than your eyesight, right? Eyesight is so vital.
It's right up there with movement and our ability to move, to
generate, to get up out of chairs, and to walk and to run, and to take
care of ourselves. Eyesight and movement are the main ways that we are
able to take care of ourselves and take care of others. When you start
having compromised eyesight or compromised movement, people need to
take care of us, and we become much more challenged in moving through
our daily life. So while it might seem nerdy to have a Snellen chart
in your home, or to do a smooth pursuit exercise a couple of times a
week, or to get outside for a few hours a day and do your reading or
your laptop work there, preserving your eyesight and preserving your
vision is one of the most life-enhancing or quality of life enhancing
things that you can do. And if you're a young person, and you can
build some of this into your framework of exercise or brain training,
if you want to call it that, that can be immensely beneficial and will
really set you up to have really good vision over a long period of
time. Now, of course, there are genetic factors, and there are injury-
related factors that can compromise eyesight and our ability to see.
And, of course, the things I'm talking about today aren't going to
solve all those issues, but they can have a tremendous, positive
impact if you're willing to do just a little bit of work, and none of
this is involving any cost, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=5580"&gt;Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just time cost. So I want, I do want to talk about a few other
things that can perhaps improve vision. I want to dispel a few myths
about stuff to take to improve vision. And then, I want to just close
by talking about how we perceive time using our vision, because that
will nicely set the stage for what we're going to talk about next
episode. So now, you understand a lot about the biology of vision. You
understand that light has to arrive at the retina and get converted
into electrical signals. That process requires things like vitamin A,
a fat soluble vitamin. It requires things like the carotinoids. That
metabolic cascade, the biochemical cascade, is essential for vision.
And this is why you've been told that carrots help you see better
'cause they're high in vitamin A. There are a few simple things you
can do to support your vision. First of all, it is true that eating
vegetables, the dark, leafy vegetables and things like carrots that
have vitamin A in abundance, and eating them in close to their raw
form, so naturally occurring foods that contain a lot of vitamin A in
their raw form can help support vision. Now, does that mean that if
you ingest super physiological amounts of that stuff, that it's going
to make your vision that much better? No, but you do need a threshold
level of vitamin A in order to see and in order to see well. Now,
there's a lot of excitement nowadays about supplementation to help
support the health of the visual system. And I'm somebody who's pretty
open to novel forms of supplementation. You've probably gathered that,
if you've been listening to this podcast for awhile. You have to
determine what's safe, and economical, and right for you, what your
risk tolerance is, et cetera. But I want to talk about a molecule
that's in a lot of supplements to support vision, and there are some
really good data on, and that's lutein. Now, the study I want to
describe is actually published in 2016. It's from the Journal of
Ophthalmology. It's a good journal. And the title of this paper is, it
might catch your attention, it's "Increased macular pigment optical
density," that just means that macula, is an area of the eye for
central vision, for high acuity vision. Pigment density there is good,
you want pigment there. "Increase macular pigment optical density "and
visual acuity," Visual acuity is your ability to see things in fine
detail. "Following consumption of a buttermilk drink "containing
lutein-enriched egg yolks." Remember, raw foods? Lutein-enriched egg
yolks. Sounds like a Rocky movie, where he would drink the raw egg
yolks. "A randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial." Now, I'm
not suggesting you go out and eat raw egg yolks. There's the risk of
salmonella. Although, I did hear this, someone correct me if I'm
wrong, but the salmonella is actually on the outside of the egg, not
actually in the egg itself, it's on the shell. For reasons that relate
to how that egg got into the world, that's where the salmonella lives,
but I could be wrong about that. But raw egg yolks are not something
that most people want to consume. What is this lutein stuff? Well,
lutein is in the pathway that relates to vitamin A and the formation
of the OPs in the photopigment that captures light in the back of your
eye, literally absorbs light pigment in your eye, and converts that
into electrical signals, and allows you to see. And there is some
evidence, I spoke to our chair of ophthalmology, there is some
evidence through quality peer-reviewed studies that supplementing with
lutein can help offset some of the detrimental effects of age-related
macular degeneration. But, I want to emphasize but, or emphasize
however, only for individuals with moderate to severe macular
degeneration. For people that have normal vision, or with a, just a
low-degree of macular degeneration, these studies did not see a
significant improvement of vision from supplementing with lutein. So,
I'm not going to to tell you to supplement with lutein or not. I don't
think any study is holy, but it does seem that if you have moderate to
severe macular degeneration, talk to your physician, of course, talk
to your ophthalmologist, I'll always say that, and I'll say it three
times, supplementing with lutein could perhaps support vision and
offset some vision loss in that case. Probably also talk to your
ophthalmologist or consider the red light therapy that I talked about
earlier. Whereas, if you have normal vision, or a low amount of
macular degeneration, it does not seem, at least from these studies,
that lutein had much of an effect. Now, I know, and I confess I'm sort
of of the mind that if I personally had age-related macular
degeneration, or a propensity for it in my family, which fortunately I
don't, but in that case, I would think that supplementing with lutein,
provided it's safe, could perhaps be of benefit. You might want to
consider a low dose of that. So again, I'm not pushing any of this on
anybody by any means, but you should know that, under certain
conditions of severe macular degeneration or moderate macular
degeneration, it does seem like lutein can be beneficial. It does not
have to be consumed through raw egg yolks, although that is the
highest density source. Cooking the egg yolk, cooking your eggs, if
you like your scrambled eggs dry, or you like your eggs not easy over
or whatever, not runny, then you aren't going to get the benefits of
the leucine. There are other sources of leucine, non-animal sources of
leucine as well. You can look those up on the internet. Now, there are
other compounds that have been shown to perhaps be important for
offsetting or helping different forms of vision loss. One is, I'm
going to spell this out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E, idebenone, idebenone,
idebenone, I can never pronounce these compounds, forgive me, unless
I've worked with them. There is evidence that it can be beneficial for
Leber's congenital eye disease. I would definitely go on to
examine.com, put in I-D-E-B-N-O-N-E. And for things like Leber's optic
neuropathies, which is a degenerative condition of the eye, whether or
not people should just be taking this stuff anyway is still an open
question. There aren't a lot of studies about it. A lot of people that
are interested in taking things to support their vision are taking
lutein as a preventative measure. I don't pass any judgment one way or
the other. Typically, those supplements also include the zeaxanthins
and astaxanthins. Okay, the pronunciation of this is terrible, I'm
sure, but that's not too far off, but basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
You can see why it's hard to pronounce, Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. And the
other one is A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N. Both of these have been shown,
excuse me, both of these have been shown to offset some of the
disruption in vision that occurs with aging. What is astaxanthin? It's
a really interesting compound. It's the red-pink pigment found in
various seafoods. So shrimp, I'm not a big seafood fan, but like
certain fish, like the, you'll see at the fish market will have that
red-pink pigment. And it's also in the feathers of flamingos, please
don't eat the feathers of flamingos, and please also don't eat
flamingos. It's structurally similar to betacarotene, so it's very pro
vitamin A, but it has some chemical differences, which may make it
safer than vitamin A. Remember, vitamin A is a lipid-soluble vitamin,
so it can be stored in our body for long periods of time. What is the
deal with this astaxanthin? You know, what are its drawbacks? Well, we
can go to our ever favorite examine.com. What does it do? Well, it has
a number of different effects, a huge number in fact, but it does seem
to notably increase, it's now been shown in three studies, the
antioxidant enzyme profile. It has a number of different effects, but
the most notable for sake of this episode, is the one on ocular blood
flow. It does seem to increase the amount of ocular blood flow, so the
blood supply to the eyes, so that makes it an interesting compound. It
has a number of other effects. For whatever reason, it also has a
notable effect, several studies have shown this, on fertility in
males. So it seems to at least double the pregnancy rate when men take
astaxanthin and works as, in particular, it seems here in men that
were previously infertile. So, I don't know if that has something to
do with the blood flow to the eyes, probably not. It probably has
something to do with something unrelated to the eyes. Nonetheless,
that's an effect of this molecule. It's also been shown to have
positive effects on things like skin elasticity, skin moisture, skin
quality, et cetera, probably due to its effects on blood flow. So
lutein, astaxanthin, A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N, and for people who have
concerns about Leber's optic neuropathies, which is going to be a
small percentage of people out there, but that is a pretty severe
condition, there are supplements that are available out there. I do
encourage you, as always, to talk to your ophthalmologist and
physician about them. And I will say that there are a number of people
that take lutein and some of these other things as a precautionary
measure, in order to bolster their health in the same way that some
people take vitamins and minerals to bolster their health, and some
people are very health, excuse me, and some people are very averse to
taking vitamins and minerals, 'cause they feel like they can get all
that from healthy, whole foods. And of course, you can get these
things from whole foods. The question is whether or not you can get
them in concentrations that are sufficient. I do think that in the
years to come, we are going to see more about lutein. I think we are
going to see more about some of these other compounds like
astaxanthin, and hopefully by then I'll be able to pronounce it. But,
at present, these things are more or less in the kind of experimental
or self-experimental phase. There are some good double-blind placebo
controlled studies, like the egg yolk buttermilk study of all things
published in really good journals. Journal of Ophthalmology, Journal
of Investigative Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, these are good
journals. These are journals are peer-reviewed by experts. The study
that I mentioned earlier about keeping rooms dark that was also
published in an excellent journal, I think it was JAMA. I'll go back
and look, it's not on my screen any longer, but very easy to find, and
there been some follow-up studies as well from the University of
Pennsylvania and other universities. So everything I've talked about
today relates to studies that were done and published in quality,
peer-reviewed journals. That doesn't necessarily mean you want to run
out and start taking this stuff that I've described, or even doing the
protocols I've described, I've given you an array, a palette, a buffet
if you will, of things that you could do to try and enhance or support
your vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=6260"&gt;Summary of Protocols, Vital Point About Blood &amp;amp; Oxygen For Vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how good your vision is, your family history of vision
and vision loss, your occupational hazards. You know, people that work
with metal filings that are flying out of machines are going to have a
higher degree of vision, you know, risk to their visual system than
well, people who just do office work. Although, if you're doing a lot
of office work, chances are you're not getting a lot of long-view
vision. Your accommodation mechanisms are going to start to suffer
over time. I think we can reliably predict that. So I've tried to give
you an array of behavioral tools, and we did touch upon some
supplementation tools. I'd be remiss if I didn't say that, because
blood flow is so critical for the neurons of the eye, remember, these
are the most metabolically active cells in your entire body, the cells
within your retina, because blood flow is required to get them the
energy and nutrients they need, having a healthy cardiovascular
system, right, doing endurance work, doing strength training work
regularly, is going to support your eyes, and your brain, and your
vision. It's indirect, but it's essential, right? It's necessary, but
it's not going to be sufficient. You're going to have to do other
things to support your eyesight, as well. But having a healthy
cardiovascular system, because it's going to deliver blood and oxygen
and nutrients to this incredible apparati on the front of your face,
these two pieces of brain, is going to support your overall brain
health and vision over time. So early in the podcast, I talked about
how the optimal window for learning is 90 minutes. That's the so
called ultradian cycle for learning. That's why we had all our
episodes to about 90 minutes. They're now starting to extend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObtW353d5i0&amp;amp;t=6360"&gt;Episode Length, Captions, Zero-Cost Support, Instagram, Searching Topics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into the hour and 50 minute and two hour mark. That simply reflects my
enthusiasm and excitement about these topics and my desire to give you
as much information as I possibly can in each episode. Please remember
you don't have to listen to the whole episode all at once. Everything
is timestamped. Everything is captioned in English and Spanish. The
captions take a few days on YouTube. We apologize for that, but in
order to have them done correctly, it takes a few days after it's
posted. So if you need those captions, please check back maybe 24 or
48 hours after the episodes are released. If you're enjoying this
podcast and the information, if you're finding it beneficial, there
are a couple of things that you can do that are totally zero cost that
really help us and help you get this information going forward. One
is, if you don't already subscribe on YouTube, please do subscribe. We
release episodes every Monday, and hopefully soon more often than
that, shorter episodes as well. But every Monday we release an
episode, please do subscribe. If you don't already subscribe on Apple
and Spotify, that's very beneficial, please do that. That helps us as
well. If you could give us a five-star review on Apple, if you feel
that that's what we deserve, and Apple also gives you the opportunity
to give us comments, feedback about the episodes. If you have
suggestions about episodes, feedback of any kind, please put it in the
comment section on YouTube. Routinely throughout the week, after the
release of each episode, I cover content in shorter format and in more
depth on Instagram @hubermanlab. Every episode is also indexed and
searchable in the search function on our website hubermanlab.com.
That's also where we post links to various studies and downloadable
protocols, all zero cost. And as I mentioned, you can search for
different topics, and it will bring you to the particular episodes
that contain the information on those topics. If you'd like to support
us on Patreon, we have a Patreon account, it's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman. There you can support us at any level that
you like. As well, if you'd like to support us, please check out our
sponsors. The sponsors that we discussed at the beginning of the
podcast are a vital way to keep the information being distributed at
zero cost to everybody. We only work with sponsors that we really love
their products and that we really respect the people that we're
working with there. And of course, there's no obligation to purchase
or to even check out those sponsors, but if you're in a position to do
so, that really does help us. Routinely throughout the podcast, we
talk about supplements. There are a lot of supplement companies and
sources of supplements out there. The one that we work with and that
we partnered with is Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency, in terms of what they say is in their
supplements is actually in their supplements, because it's
independently tested and verified. As well as the amounts that they
list on the bottles actually are matched by what's in the capsules and
tablets. That's a serious problem in the supplement industry, and
Thorne deals with that problem by being very truthful and very
accurate about what's in their supplements and how much of those
things are in there. If you want to see the supplements that I take,
you can go to Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman. There, you'll see all the
supplements that I take. You can get 20% off any of those supplements,
as well as 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne happens to
make, if you happen to navigate into their website through that
portal, thorne.com/u/huberman. And last but not least, I want to thank
you for your time and attention today. Your willingness to learn about
vision and the visual system and the various things that you can do to
help support the health and functioning of your visual system. And of
course, I want to thank you for your interest in science. [upbeat

of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I
review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles
properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the
visual physiological basis of the "extra gear" we all can leverage for
effort. Finally, I review how accelerating as we fatigue can allow us
to access untapped energetic resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;welcome to the hubermann lab podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life  i'm andrew huberman and i'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at stanford school of
medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles
at stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information about science and science related tools
to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is roca rocco makes
sunglasses and eyeglasses and i'm delighted that they're a partner and
a sponsor for the podcast as some of you may already know i've spent
two decades or more studying the visual system how we see vision is
absolutely the most important sense by which humans navigate the world
and survive and our eyes as two pieces of our brain do many other
important things as well so taking good care of our eyesight is
essential founded by two all-american swimmers from stamford roca was
born out of an obsession for performance they carefully put science
and purpose behind their design choices and they built absolutely
terrific products as a result the glasses are amazing i love them
because they look great they are super comfortable and the optical
clarity is incredible they filter out sunlight in a way that still
allows you to see contrast and shadows the way you need to you know
for me one of the things that's really irritating is if i have a pair
of sunglasses that don't allow me to see all the things i want to see
and with roka glasses i get incredible contrast but then i can also
relax and be outdoors in bright light and as the amount of light
changes with cloud cover and things of that sort my ability to see my
surroundings is still really sharp and really clear and that only
comes from really understanding how the visual system works and how it
adjusts to contrast and adaptation and all these different things they
really understand the science and that went into the design of these
glasses and as many of you know sunlight and the viewing of light is
also very important for setting circadian rhythms so that's also been
incorporated into the design and science behind these glasses i do
wear readers i don't often wear them during the podcast but i have to
wear reading glasses at night so i use their readers and i own a pair
of their sunglasses and i'm delighted with them if you'd like to check
out roka glasses you can go to roca.com that's roka.com and enter the

podcast is also brought to you by inside tracker inside tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and
dna to help you better understand your body and reach your health
goals i'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the
simple reason that many of the important things that are vital to our
immediate and long-term health can only be detected in a good quality
blood test the problem with blood tests is that most blood tests you
get a lot of information back about levels that are too high or too
low of this thing or the other thing but making sense of that and what
to do with that information is very challenging even if you have a
really attentive physician oftentimes it's mysterious as to what to do
with all this data with inside tracker they make it very easy to
understand what all the metabolic factors hormone factors etc mean for
you and what to do about those markers so they offer you directives in
terms of nutrition supplementation as well as lifestyle factors like
exercise sleep etc that can allow you to take control of those numbers
and bring them into the ranges that are best for you and your long-
term health another feature of inside tracker that's great is their
inner age test this test shows you what your biological age and how it
compares to your chronological age which i can only imagine most
everybody including me are extremely interested in how long am i
likely to live how old am i really in terms of my biology if you'd
like to try inside tracker you can visit insidetracker.com huberman to
get 25 off any of inside tracker's plans use the code huberman at
checkout today's episode is also brought to us by athletic greens
athletic greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink i've
been using athletic green since 2012 and so i'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast with athletic greens you get a ton of factors
that are good for you mixed into this one really good tasting drink i
like to mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice and i
drink that once or twice a day typically once early in the day and
sometimes also in the afternoon or even evening i'm able to sleep
after drinking in the evening just fine the reason i've been using
athletic greens for so long that i continue to use athletic greens is
that one i feel better when i take it i just do psychologically
physically i feel better but also it covers all my bases of the things
that i need for my general health sort of a foundational supplement as
i like to call it in fact when people ask me what should i take if i
were to recommend just one supplement that people take it would be
athletic greens with athletic greens you get support for your gut
which is important because the gut microbiome is important for the gut
brain access for mood metabolism hormones etc there are so many data
that support that statement as well there are many factors in athletic
greens that support general health metabolism endocrine factors
immunity etc so with athletic greens i drink it once or twice a day
and i know that i've got all that covered if you'd like to try
athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and if you
do that you can claim a special offer they'll send you five free
travel packs plus a year surpr supply excuse me of vitamin d3 and k2
so you get the 5 free travel packs and a year supply of d3 if you go
to athleticgreens.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=345"&gt;Why Everyone Should Train Endurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;huberman you can claim that special offer for the last month four
episodes to be exact we've been discussing physical performance and
skill learning we've talked about how to learn skills faster whether
or not those are skills for athletic performance dance music things of
that sort we've also talked about how to gain strength and how to lose
fat faster by leveraging the nervous system things like shiver and
non-shiver non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis we talked about
how neurons can actually trigger accelerated fat loss we talked about
hypertrophy also called muscle growth and we covered everything from
sets and reps protocols how long to stay in a cold ice bath when to
get out how to keep shivering we've covered a lot of tools and a lot
of science so if you're interested in those things and you even
perhaps want to learn a little bit about how we make energy atp from
carbohydrates or from fats it's all covered in the previous four
episodes this was going to be the time that we moved to a new topic
entirely but we are going to do one more episode in this series on
physical performance for the simple reason that you asked many
questions about something that's vitally important both for physical
performance and long-term and short-term health and that's endurance
and so today we are going to talk about endurance now if you're a
strength athlete or you're not interested in endurance don't depart
just yet because it turns out that there are ways to train endurance
that are very different than i would have previously imagined if you
only think about long runs long swims marathons half marathons 10ks
5ks and that sort of thing puts you to sleep kind of like costello is
snoring in the background right now he's not a long distance endurance
athlete that's for sure if you're interested in those things or if you
are averse to those things i encourage you to continue listening
because we are going to talk about a little bit of science and then
some specific protocols that really define what endurance is the four
types of endurance and ways to train those in concert with the other
things that you might be doing like weight training or skill training
or yoga and if you are an endurance athlete we are going to cover a
lot of tools and science that i'm certain will also help enhance your
training and performance in races or even just recreationally the
topic of endurance i think has been badly misrepresented frankly
online and when you start digging into the science and you start
talking to real experts in this area what you discover what i've
discovered is that it's an incredibly interesting area because it
teaches us so much about how our body and our brain use fuels and how
we can control which fuels are used by our body and brain so today we
will talk about the four kinds of endurance we will also cover the
topic of hydration which might sound incredibly boring like okay just
drink more water but it's really interesting because not only is
hydration a limiting factor on performance but there is a right way to
hydrate and there is a wrong way to hydrate there actually is a
formula that i'll teach you to know how much water to be drinking
depending on your activity levels and if that sounds like a simple
thing like oh just you know tap off water until your urine runs clear
that's actually the wrong advice it turns out that if you don't
hydrate properly you can see 20 to 30 percent reductions in
performance whether or not that strength whether that's increasing
hypertrophy whether or not that's running swimming even mental
performance so even if you're not an athlete or a recreational athlete
at all i encourage you to stay tuned for the part about hydration so
we're going to cover as usual a little bit of science and then we're
going to dive right into protocols that you can apply if you like and
if you deem those correct and safe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=589"&gt;All Episodes Now Searchable at hubermanlab.com &amp;amp; The Neural Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for you before we dive into all that i want to make an important
announcement which is all the episodes of the hubermann lab podcast
are now housed on a single website which is hubermanlab.com if you go
to hubermannlab.com you can find all the episodes in youtube apple and
spotify format with links there the website is also searchable so if
you go into the little search function which you'll find very easily
and you put in for instance creatine or sleep or ice bath or sauna it
will take you to the specific episodes that contain that information
and in addition if you go to the website hubermanlab.com you have the
opportunity to sign up for what we call the hubermann lab neural
network the hubermann lab neural network is a zero cost resource where
once a month perhaps more often you'll receive a email newsletter and
that newsletter will contain specific protocols announcements
attachments of pdfs and things of that sort of protocols tools and
science from the podcast we will also make any announcements about
live lectures which at some point i'll probably start doing in various
cities in the us and probably around the world as well as well as
other things that i think would be really useful to you all of course
at zero cost so that's hubermanlab.com sign up for the neural network
newsletter you can find that in the menu tab or it might pop up when
you get there and i hope you will join and as a final announcement if
you're not already following us on instagram you can go to huberman
lab on instagram and if you do that i often make announcements and
release protocols and links to protocols and things there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=688"&gt;How To Maintain Muscle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as well i briefly want to touch on something from the previous episode
which is that if you are somebody that is trying to increase muscle
strength and or size or if you're simply somebody who doesn't want to
increase muscle strength and size you just want to maintain the
musculature that you have it's vital that you perform at least five
sets of resistance training per muscle per week if we don't do that we
lose muscle over time and that is one reason among many to have a
regular resistance training protocol nobody wants to start resembling
a folded over envelope or a melted candle no one wants to have
challenges getting up out of a chair or off the ground maintaining
musculature is vital not just to our immediate health but to our long-
term health trajectory so i just want to emphasize that point if
you're curious about the sets the reps how close to failure to go or
not go whether or not you should be doing your cardiovascular training
before or after your weight training all of that is in the previous
episode right down to the details and i like to think made simple for
you to understand but i do strongly believe that resistance training
whether or not it's with body weight or bands or weights or simply
lifting rocks in the yard or logs in the yard is vital for our
systemic physiology and our overall health and that includes our brain
health and i described the reasons for that and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=776"&gt;Endurance: It’s Not What You Think, Crossover With Brain Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the mechanisms in the previous episode today i'd like to talk about
endurance and how to build endurance and how to use endurance for the
health of your entire body endurance as the name suggests is our
ability to engage in continuous bouts of exercise or continuous
movement or continuous effort of any kind and i do believe that our
ability to engage in activities that we call endurance training or
physical endurance activities do have carryover to mental performance
of things that require long-term effort i'll touch on that at the end
and why there's reason to believe that there's a biological crossover
between those two things i don't think it's simply the case that if
you train yourself to be a strength and speed athlete and to do short
bouts of exercise that are very intense that you can only do mental
work that's of short bouts and very intense but it is clear that
cardiovascular exercise exercise where you're getting your heart rate
up continuously for a period of time and endurance exercise we will
define what that is in a moment is vital for tapping into and
enhancing various aspects of our biology in the body and in the brain
such that our brain can perform work for longer periods of time
focused work learning etc so i want to dive into the topic of
endurance and i want to just begin by addressing something that's
vital to any kind of effort whether or not it's mental effort or
physical effort so as always a little bit of science and we'll get
right into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=878"&gt;Energy; Many Paths To ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;protocols so the key thing to understand about energy production in
the body meaning your ability to think your ability to talk your
ability to walk your ability to run is this thing that we call atp atp
and mitochondria which are just little what we call organelles within
cells these are little factories that make energy if you will atp is
required for anything that requires energy for anything that you do
that requires effort and there are different ways to get atp and we
have been gifted as a species with the ability to convert lots of
things into atp we can convert carbohydrates literally the kinds of
carbohydrates you eat a bagel you eat a piece of pizza pizza usually
is dough and it has cheese and some other things costello here as we
talk about pizza custard loves pizza by the way eating a piece of
pizza it gets converted into various things fatty acids from the fats
glucose from the bread and those things get converted into atp within
cells through things like glycolysis things like lipolysis i talked
about this in previous episodes so our muscles and our neurons use
different fuel sources to generate atp the ones that are used first
for short bouts of intense activity are things like phosphocreatine if
you've only heard about creatine as a supplement well phosphocreatine
actually exists in our muscles and that's why people take creatine you
can load your muscles with more creatine and though and excuse me
phosphate creatine is great for short intense bouts of effort so when
you're really pushing hard on something physical let's say you see a
car on the side of the road and that car is stalled and a person says
hey can you help me push my car and you start to push that's gonna be
phosphocreatine it's gonna be your main fuel source then you start to
tap into things like glucose which is literally just carbohydrate it's
just sugar that's in your blood and then if you keep pushing on that
car you keep in engaging in a particular effort or you keep studying
or you keep listening to this podcast you start to tap into other fuel
sources like glycogen from your liver which is just it's like a little
pack just like you know you might have packed a sandwich or something
for work you have a little pack of glycogen in your liver that you can
rely on and you have fat stored in adipose tissue even if you have
very very low body fat percentage like you're one of these people as
like three percent or five percent body fat really thin skin very
little body fat you can extract lipids fatty acids from that body fat
it's like a storage pack it is a storage pack for energy that can be
converted to atp so without going into any more detail when i say
today energy or i say atp just remember that regardless of your diet
regardless of your nutritional plan your body has the capacity to use
creatine glucose glycogen lipids and if you're ketogenic ketones we'll
talk about ketosis in order to generate fuel energy now the other
crucial point is that in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=1080"&gt;The Vital Need For Oxygen: But Why?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;order to complete that process of taking these fuels and converting
them into energy most of the time you need oxygen you need air
basically in your system now it's not actual air you need oxygen
molecules in your system comes in through your mouth and your nose
goes to your lungs and distributes via the bloodstream oxygen is not a
fuel but like a fire that has no oxygen you can't actually burn the
logs but when you blow a lot of oxygen onto a fire basically onto a
logs with a flame there then basically it will take five it will take
fire it will burn okay oxygen allows you to burn fuel so today we are
going to ask the critical questions what allows us to perform what
allows us to continue effort for long periods of time and that effort
could be a run it could be a swim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=1140"&gt;What Allows Us To Endure (Anything)?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it could be studying it could be anything that extends over a long
period of time well you're going to need energy and you're going to
need oxygen but the way to answer a question like what allows us to
endure right endurance what allows us to keep going well we think of
things like willpower but what's willpower willpower is neurons it's
neurons in our brain we have this thing called the central governor
which decides whether or not we should or could continue or whether or
not we should stop whether or not we should quit okay so whether or
not you're somebody who has a lot of what we would call resilience and
endurance or whether or not you're somebody who taps out early and
quits early or can't handle frustration that has to do with your fuel
utilization in specific neurons so we have to ask the question what is
the limiting factor on performance right so instead of saying what
allows us to endure we should say what prevents us from enduring what
prevents us from moving forward what are the factors that say you know
what no more i'm not going to continue this run or you know what i've
had a really long hard day or maybe i've had an easy day or i'm
feeling lazy i just don't even really feel like getting up and moving
so what we're going to talk about today actually gets right down to
the heart of motivation and fuel use motivation and fuel allocation
and we are going to talk about specific training protocols that you
can follow that have carryover between the bodily systems of running
swimming etc and the way that your brain works so let's talk about
endurance by asking first what are the limiting factors on endurance
what stops us because in addressing that and answering that we will
understand what allows us to get into effort and to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=1246"&gt;The 5 Things That Allow Us To Persist/Endure &amp;amp; What Causes Quitting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;continue effort there are five main categories of things that allow us
to engage in effort and they are neurons nerves muscle muscle blood
things in our blood our heart and our lungs now i don't want to
completely write off things like the immune system and other systems
of the body but nerve muscle blood heart and lungs are the five that i
want to focus on today because that's where most of the data are as we
go forward into this i want to acknowledge dr andy galpin who as with
the last episode it's been tremendously helpful and informative in
terms of the exercise physiology is a true expert he has a laboratory
he's a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy who understands
the science but who also works with athletes and works with
recreational athletes professional athletes really understands at a
variety of levels how all these systems work he's the person i
consulted with about today's episode although i did access other
literature as well and i'm going to mention a key review for any of
you aficionados who really want to get down into the weeds but i
encourage you if you want more detail to check out dr andy galpin's
youtube page i think he's also on twitter he's definitely on instagram
his content is excellent and he really understands i have learned and
i really believe that an intellectual is somebody who understands a
topic at multiple levels of specificity of detail and can communicate
that and andy is a true intellectual of muscle physiology and
performance and if you hear the word intellectual and you kind of back
up and cringe from that understand that he's also a practitioner so
thank you andrew galpin andy galpin for your support in these episodes
and we hope to have you as a guest on the podcast soon so nerve muscle
blood heart and lungs let's talk about neurons and how they work okay
but i want to tell you about an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=1370"&gt;Why You Quit: It IS All In Your Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;experiment that's going to make it very clear why quitting is a mental
thing not a physical thing so why do we quit well an experiment was
done a couple years ago and was published in the journal cell cell
press journal excellent journal showing that there is a class of
neurons in our brain stem in the back of our brain that if they shut
off we quit now these neurons release epinephrine epinephrine is
adrenaline and any time we are engaged in effort of any kind we are
releasing epinephrine any time we're awake really we are releasing
epinephrine into our brain in fact this little group of neurons in the
back of our brain is called the locus ceruleus if you like is churning
out epinephrine all the time but if something stresses us out it turns
out more and then it acts as kind of an alertness signal for the whole
brain we also of course have adrenaline epinephrine released in our
body which makes our body ready for things so think about epinephrine
as a readiness signal and when we are engaged in effort this readiness
signal is being churned into our brain when we're relaxed and we're
falling asleep epinephrine levels are low okay so they did a really
interesting experiment where they had subjects engage in bouts of
effort of trying to move forward toward a goal but they manipulated
the visual environment with these stripes kind of like fences passing
on both sides of them and by doing that they could trick subjects into
thinking that their effort was either allowing them to move forward
right because these rungs on the fence were moving past or that their
effort was futile that they were no longer moving forward because they
would make the rungs move slowly even though the subjects were making
a lot of effort to move forward okay so this is analogous or similar
to being on a treadmill and you're trying to walk on this treadmill
and you just can't move the conveyor right or you're in virtual
reality and you're putting a ton of effort but it seems like you're
moving excruciatingly slow i had this experience recently in real life
i was doing a swim in the pacific i was trying to go south and i was
swimming and i was caught in a current not the kind that pulls you out
to ocean and i kept looking to my left and i saw this hotel on the
shoreline and then i was swimming and swimming and swimming and
swimming and 20 minutes later i looked to my left and the hotel is
still exactly where it was before which meant that i wasn't moving it
felt futile eventually either the current changed or something change
and i eventually swam past the hotel got back on the beach and
eventually drove home that's essentially what they did in this
experiment but what they found was these neurons that release
epinephrine there's another cell type called glia which actually means
glue in latin that is paying attention to how much epinephrine is
being released and at some point the system reaches a threshold it
reaches this threshold and it shuts off the release of more
epinephrine it's like i quit that's it no more effort signal if they
could extend the time before those glia said ah enough if they could
release more adrenaline into the system then subjects would keep going
so our desire to continue or put differently our willingness to
continue and our desire to quit is mediated by events between our two
ears now that doesn't mean that the body's not involved but it means
that neurons are critically important so we have two categories of
neurons that are important the ones in our head that tell us get up
and go out and take that run and the ones that allow us encourage us
to continue that run and we have neurons that shut things off that say
no more and we of course have the neurons that connect to our muscles
and control our muscles but the reason we quit is rarely because our
body quits our mind quits now we never want to encourage people to
drive themselves to the point of injury that's not going to be good
for anybody but it is good to know that it's neural our ability to
persist is neural so when people say is it i hear that you know sports
or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=1639"&gt;The “90% Mental” Myth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;effort or fighting or um it's 90 mental 10 physical you know that that
whole discussion about how much is mental how much is physical is
absolutely silly it just proves that there's no knowledge of the
underlying biology behind that statement it's neither mental nor
physical everything is physical everything is neurons your thinking is
the responsibility of chemicals and electrical signals in your head so
it's not 90 percent mental 10 physical it's not 50 50. it's not 70 30.
it's 100 nervous system it's neurons okay so when people say mental or
physical understand it's 100 neural and i'd love for the how much of
of it is mental and how much is physical to just disappear that that
argument means nothing and it's not actionable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=1690"&gt;The Critical Need For Carbohydrates &amp;amp; Electrolytes (&amp;amp; Sometimes Ketones)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now what do nerves need in order to continue to fire what do you need
in order to get neurons to say i will persist well they need glucose
unless you're keto and ketogenic adapted you need carbohydrate is
glucose that's what neurons run on and you need electrolytes neurons
have what's called a sodium potassium pump blah blah blah they
generate electricity we could go into all this i will probably do an
entire lecture about the action potential but basically in order to
get nerves nerve cells to fire to contract muscle to say i'm going to
continue you need sufficient sodium salt because the action potential
the actual firing of neurons is driven by sodium entering the cell
rushing into the cell and then there's a removal of potassium and then
there's a kind of resetting of those levels by something called the
sodium potassium pump and the sodium potassium pump and sodium and
action potentials even if you don't know anything about that is atp
dependent it requires energy so you need energy in order to get
neurons to fire and it is ph dependent it depends on the conditions or
the environment within the brain being of a certain ph or acidity ph
is about how acid or how basic the environment is and we will talk a
little bit about ph in simple terms that you can understand so nerves
need salt they need potassium and it turns out they need magnesium and
you need glucose and carbohydrates in order to power those neurons
unless you are running on ketones and to run on ketones you have to
make sure that you're fully keto adapted i will talk about adding in
ketones on top of carbohydrate at the end of the episode okay so
that's how nerves work you need carbohydrate you need sodium potassium
and magnesium in order to drive the brain muscle muscle is going to
engage and generate energy first by using this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=1810"&gt;Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Is Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;phospho-creatine system high bouts of effort really intense effort
short-lived seconds to minutes but probably more like seconds this
could be this phosphate creatine literally a fuel source in the muscle
that you're going to burn just like you would logs on a fire and
glycogen which is stored carbohydrate in the muscle that also can be
burned just like logs on a fire to generate energy so let me make this
crystal clear if you move your wrist towards your shoulder and
contract your bicep really hard muscle fibers are burning up their own
carbohydrate they're converting that into atp in order to generate
that energy okay and ph is important and temperature is important in
the episode on supercharge your physical performance i talked all
about how by using cooling specifically of the palms or the bottoms of
the feet or the cheeks of the face using particular methods you can
adjust the temperature of the body and of muscle in a way that allows
you to do more work to do more reps to run further to keep going and
to persist and that's because if temperature is too low or too high
then atp is not going to be available because of this whole thing
called the pyruvate kinase pathway and the temperature dependence of
pyruvate kinase check out that episode if you want to learn more about
that but temperature is important and ph is also important so we got
nerve muscle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=1896"&gt;Using Your Blood, Heart, &amp;amp; Lungs To Go Longer, Further, With More Intensity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then there's stuff in our blood that's available as an energy
source and in blood we've got glucose so literally blood sugar that's
floating around so let's say you have fasted for three days your blood
glucose is going to be very low so that's not going to be a great fuel
source but you will start to liberate fats from your adipose tissue
from your fat fatty acids will start to mobilize into the bloodstream
and you can burn those for energy and oxygen in your blood when you
inhale you're bringing oxygen into your blood so these are all fuel
sources in your neurons in your muscle in your blood in your various
tissues that are providing the opportunity to give effort to to induce
effort whether or not to run or swim or writing or talking now there
are some other factors that are important and those are the heart
which is going to move blood so the more that the heart can move blood
and oxygen well the more fuel that's going to be available for you to
engage in muscular effort and thinking effort so your heart is vitally
important to your your muscles ability to work in your brain's ability
to work and as i've mentioned oxygen a few times it should be obvious
then that the lungs are very important you need to bring oxygen in and
distribute it to all these tissues because oxygen is critical for the
conversion of carbohydrates and the conversion of fats and we could
get into the discussion about whether or not oxygen is important for
ketogenic metabolism but you need oxygen there you need to breathe and
you need to breathe properly so i just covered what would normally be
about four lectures of energy consumption and energy utilization i
didn't go into much detail at all but what i want you to imagine is
that you've got these different cell types you've got neurons you've
got muscle they need to collaborate in order to generate effort or to
make the decision to do something or to think hard or to run hard or
to run far and then you've got fuel sources both in the neurons in the
muscle in your blood and then the heart and lungs are are going to
help distribute the oxygen and those fuels and of course you have that
little energy pack that we call the liver that will allow you to pull
out a little more carbohydrate if you need it for work okay so that's
as much as i want to cover about energy consumption because that's a
lot but what it tells you is that when you eat and you use food as a
fuel source that food can be broken down and you can immediately burn
the glucose that's in your bloodstream or you can rely on some of the
stored fuel in your liver or you can rely on stored fuel in the muscle
so called glycogen and there are a lot of different ways that we can
generate atp so when we ask the question what's limiting for
performance what is going to allow us to endure to engage in effort
and endure long balance of effort or even moderately long balance of
effort we need to ask which of those things nerve muscle blood heart
and lungs is limiting or put differently we ask what should we be
doing with our neurons what should we be doing with our muscles what
should we be doing with our blood what should we be doing with our
heart and what should we be doing with our lungs that's going to allow
us to build endurance for mental and physical work and to be able to
go longer further with more intensity that's the real question how can
we do more work and the way we do that is with energy and the way to
get energy to it is by those five things and so now we're going to
talk about how you can actually build different types of endurance and
what that does at the level of your blood your heart your muscles and
your neurons so we're going to skip back and forth between protocols
tools and the underlying science so rather than heavy stack the
science at the front end and then just give you all the tools at the
end we're going to talk about the protocols the four kinds of
endurance and how to achieve them and we are going to talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=2140"&gt;An Excellent Review on the Science of Training Adaptations (See Caption On YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about the underlying science as we move through that if you would like
a lot of detailed science i encourage you to check out a review that
we've linked in the show notes and the review is called adaptations to
endurance and strength training this is a review article with many
excellent citations it's from cold spring harbor perspectives in
medicine the cold spring harbor press is an excellent scientific press
it's been the last 21 years doing summers at cold spring harbor
teaching neuroscience but cold spring harbor is involved in all sorts
of themes and topics related to neuroscience and medicine this review
by hughes elephant elephant that's the name alphasyn and bar b-a-a-r
adaptations to endurance and strength training is rich with citations
it can be downloaded as a complete pdf there's no paywall and we will
link to it and it gets really deep into all the signaling cascades the
genetic changes within muscle with high intensity interval training
short term super high intensity training uh weight training so if
you're a real nerd for this stuff and you want to get right down into
how pgc one alpha p53 and ph 20 change the adaptation features of
muscle and gene regulation that is definitely the review for you if
you're like most people and you're not really interested in that level
of detail no reason to pick up the review unless you just want to
check out some of the the figures and pictures but i do want to offer
that as a resource it's been a in addition to discussions with dr andy
galpin it's been a primary resource for the content of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=2235"&gt;The 4 Kinds of Endurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;episode so let's talk about the four kinds of endurance and how to
achieve those i do believe that everybody should have some sort of
endurance practice regular endurance practice it's clear that it's
vital for the functioning of the body and the mind and there are clear
longevity benefits there are a lot of reasons why that's true but the
main one is that if we have good energy utilization in our musculature
and in our blood in our vascular system and in our oxygenating system
our lungs the so-called cardiovascular system respiratory system and
musculature the body and brain function much better there are so many
papers now so much data to support that so i do believe everyone
should either try to maintain the muscle that they have provided
they've already gone through puberty and development and they should
be engaged in regular endurance exercise now for many people they
think endurance exercise that means what an hour long run or i got to
get on the stairmaster or i have to treadmill for hours on end each
week it turns out that's not the case there are four kinds of
endurance and you can train specifically for any one of those and you
can vary your training so let's talk about those four kinds of
endurance these are very interesting and they each have very different
protocols that you use in order to build and maximize them and now
you'll understand what fuel sources they use in order to build that
thing we call endurance so first of all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=2333"&gt;Muscular Endurance: Powerful for Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have muscular endurance muscular endurance is the ability for our
muscles to perform work over time and our failure to continue to be
able to perform that work is going to be due to muscular fatigue not
to cardiovascular fatigue so not because we're breathing too hard or
we can't get enough blood to the muscles or because we quit mentally
but because the muscles themselves give out okay one good example of
this would be if you had to pick up a stone in the yard and that stone
is not extremely heavy for you and you needed to do that anywhere from
50 to 100 times and you you're picking it up and putting it down and
picking it up and putting it down and picking up and putting it down
at some point your muscles will fatigue they will fail to endure
muscular endurance is incredibly useful for a variety of physical
pursuits and we'll talk about the mental pursuits that it supports as
well in terms of physical pursuits the ability for a given muscle to
perform repeated work is going to improve your golf swing it's going
to improve your tennis swing it's going to improve your posture your
ability to dance your ability to repeatedly engage in an activity that
requires effort in a way that's very different from the kind of
endurance that you will build simply by increasing your cardiovascular
fitness your ability to generate kind of easy repetition so let's talk
about muscular endurance and what it is muscular endurance is going to
be something that you can perform for anywhere from 12 to 25 or even
up to 100 repetitions and that's actually how if you like you would
train muscular endurance and i'll give this specific protocol in a few
moments so a good example is push-ups right if you were to get on the
floor and start doing push-ups even if you're somebody who has to do
knees down push-ups and you're doing your push-ups eventually you
won't be able to do any more push-ups and that's not going to be
because you couldn't get enough oxygen into your system or your heart
wasn't pumping enough blood it's going to be because the muscles fail
that's why so if you want to be able to do more push-ups or even more
pull-ups muscular endurance is really what it's about it's actually no
coincidence that a lot of military boot camp style training is not
done with weights it's done with things like push-ups pull-ups sit-ups
and running because what they're really building is muscular endurance
the ability to perform work repeatedly over time for a given set of
muscles and neurons so what's a good protocol to build muscular
endurance let's just give that to you now and explain some of the
underlying science as that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=2510"&gt;Protocol For Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it follows so a really good muscular endurance training protocol
according to the scientific literature would be three to five sets of
anywhere from 12 to 100 repetitions that's a huge range now 12 to 25
repetitions is going to be more reasonable for most people and the
rest periods are going to be anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds of rest
so anywhere from half a minute to three minutes of rest so this might
be five sets of push-ups done getting your maximum push-up so for some
people that might be zero and you have to do it knees down for some
people it might be ten push-ups for some people might be 25 but you
could go all the way up to 100 rest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds
and then do your next set for a total of three to five sets so it
doesn't actually sound like a ton of work the other thing you could do
is something like a plank a plank position is actually a way to build
muscular endurance not strength okay it's i'm sure it could be used to
develop strength but it's really about muscular endurance so you would
do three to five sets of planks those planks would probably even
because you're not doing repetitions it's an isometric hold as we say
it's kind of static hold or a wall sit would be another example and
you would do that probably for a minute or two minutes take some rest
of anywhere from 30 or 60 or 180 seconds and then repeat so things
like pushing a sled push-ups isometric planks even pull-ups those will
all work and as with other forms of training you would want to do this
until you approach failure or actually fail and where you're unable to
perform another repetition that would mark the end of a set the one
critical feature of building muscular endurance is that it has no
major eccentric loading component now i haven't talked much about
eccentric and concentric loading but concentric loading is when you
are shortening the muscle typically or lifting a weight and eccentric
movements are when you are lengthening a muscle typically or lowering
a weight so if you do a pull up and you get your chin over the bar or
chin up that's the concentric portion of the effort and then as you
lower yourself that's the eccentric portion eccentric portion of
resistance training of any kind whether or not it's for endurance or
for strength is one of the major causes of soreness some people will
be more susceptible to of this to this excuse me than others but it
does create more damage in muscle fibers muscular endurance and
building muscular endurance should not include any movements that
include major eccentric loads so if you're going to do push-ups it
doesn't mean that you want to drop you know smash your chest into the
floor and by the way your chest should touch the ground on every push-
up that's a real push-up okay it's not about breaking 90 with the
elbows it's about pushing down until your chest touch the floor and
straightening out that's a proper push-up and a pull-up is where you
pull your chin above the bar neither of those should include a slow
eccentric or lowering component if you are using those to train
muscular endurance the three to five sets of 12 to 25 and maybe even
up to 100 repetitions with 30 to 180 seconds of rest in between that
means that jumping also is going to be a very poor tool for building
muscular endurance because jumping has a slowing down component as you
land so things like plyometrics or agility work where you're moving
from side to side and you're decelerating you're slowing yourself down
a lot not going to be good for muscular endurance terrific for
cardiovascular training and conditioning of other kinds and skill
training and agility and all that but if you want to build muscular
endurance you want to make your muscles able to do more work for
longer it's going to be this three to five sets of 12 to 100 reps 30
to 180 seconds of mainly concentric movement okay not a slow lowering
phase or a heavy lowering phase so that might be kettlebell swings and
things of that sort isometrics as i mentioned things like plank wall
sets will work now what's interesting about this is that it doesn't
seem at all like what people normally think of as endurance and yet
it's been shown in nice quality peer-reviewed studies several of which
are cited in the review i mentioned earlier that muscular endurance
can improve our ability to engage in long bouts of what we call long
duration low intensity endurance work so this can support long runs it
can support long swims and it can build also it can build postural
strength and endurance simultaneously and that's mainly accomplished
through isometric hold so things like planks are actually quite good
for building endurance of the spinal erector muscles that provide
posture of the abdominal muscles that are helpful for posture for
being upright for the upper neck muscles and things of that sort we
these days everyone seems to have text neck everyone's basically
staring at their toes all the time it has a default towards their toes
so isometric holds can be very good for building muscular endurance
you can spot people including yourself perhaps with poor muscular
endurance in the postural muscles because anytime they stop moving
they have to lean against a wall or their hip will move to one side or
they're always lean to one side i am guilty of this too some of you
have actually pointed out i like to think out of concern that i often
am rubbing my lower back and indeed i have some asymmetries in my
postural muscles some of which are probably genetic and some of which
are probably just from excessive work or something of that sort that
have my right shoulder sit lower than my left and things that sort if
i wanted to improve those i could improve those by really focusing on
symmetry and isometric symmetry meaning hold my holding my hands at
equivalent positions in planks and doing isometric holds for building
muscular endurance of the postural muscles but this can also be done
with as i mentioned kettlebell swings for the lower back and legs and
posterior chains so there are a number of different exercises you
could do this with but it should be compound exercises mainly it's
rare for people to do this kind of muscular endurance work
specifically for things like bicep curls or triceps and there aren't
many activities that really rely on isolation of those muscles and
repeatedly right it's hard i'm sure there are some out there but it's
kind of hard to imagine so you can do this with isometrics you can do
this with more standard non-isometric type movements but make sure
there isn't a strong eccentric load so now let's talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=2920"&gt;How to Make Muscles More Resilient: Mitochondrial Respiration, Neuronal Firing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about the science briefly of why this works well that takes us back to
this issue of fuel utilization and what fails so if we were to say
okay uh let's say you do a plank uh and you're planking for you know
maybe you're able to plank for a minute or two minutes or three
minutes at some point you will fail you're not going to fail because
the heart gives out you're not going to fail because you can't get
enough oxygen because you can breathe while you're doing that you're
going to fail because of local muscular failure which means that as
you do if you choose to do this protocol of three to five sets etc etc
to build muscular endurance mainly what you are going to be building
is you're going to be building the ability of your mitochondria to use
oxygen to generate energy locally and that it's something called
mitochondrial respiration respiration because of the the involvement
of oxygen and it's also going to be increasing the extent to which the
neurons control the muscles and provide a stimulus for the muscles to
contract but this is independent of power and strength okay so even
though the the low sets like three to five sets and the fact that
you're doing repetitions and you're going to failure even though it
seems to resemble power and strength and hypertrophy type training it
is distinctly different it's not going to generate strength
hypertrophy and power it's going to mainly create this ability to
endure to continually contract muscles or repeatedly contract muscles
okay continually if you're using isometric holds repeatedly repeatedly
excuse me if you're using repetition type exercise where there's a
contraction and an extension of the muscle essentially a concentric
and an eccentric portion but remember that you want the eccentric
portion to be light and relatively fast not so fast that you injure
yourself but certainly not deliberately slowed down it was recommended
i should say by andy galpin that you not use olympic lifts for this
because once you get past 8 or 12 or 25 repetitions especially form on
those olympic lifts is key for not getting injured and while some
people can perform those sorts of of lifts like you know snatches and
deadlifts and cleans and jerks and overhead presses probably not a
great idea if the goal is to push the body to points of fatigue
because you do open yourself up to injury unless you're very skilled
at doing that or you have a really good coach who can help you guide
through those lifts so that's one form of endurance which is muscular
endurance that's mainly going to rely on neural energy so nerves and
muscle and it's not going to rely quite so much on what's available in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=3091"&gt;Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes or More, One “Set”, Efficiency of Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your blood your heart or your lungs so now let's talk about the other
extreme of endurance which is long duration endurance this is the type
that people typically think about when they think about endurance
you're talking about a long run a long swim a long bike ride well how
long will anywhere from 12 minutes to several hours or maybe even an
entire day maybe eight or nine hours of hiking or running or biking
some people are actually doing those kinds of really long events
marathons for instance so anything longer than 12 minutes and this
type of work builds on fuel utilization in the muscles it builds on
the activity of neurons in the brain that are involved in what we call
central pattern generators we talked about this in a previous episode
or several previous episodes these are groups of neurons that allow
our body to engage in regular rhythmic effort without having to think
about the movement too much so running and stepping or swimming if you
already know how to swim or pedaling on a bike or walking upstairs and
hiking you're not thinking about right left right left it's all
carried out by central pattern generators this is going to be at less
than 100 percent of your maximum oxygen uptake your vo2 max i'll talk
about what vo2 max is but i just want to give a sense of what the
protocol is and the underlying science how many sets one long duration
effort is one set of 12 minutes or longer so you're not counting
repetitions i sure hope that if you're going out on a 30 minute run or
even a 15 minute run that you're not counting steps that you're not
counting pedal strokes that you're not on the row or counting pulls on
the rower i suppose you could but i think that would be pretty
dreadful seems like a poor utilization of cognitive brain space you're
getting into regular repeated effort and your ability to continue that
effort is going to be dependent mainly on the efficiency of the
movement on your ability to strike a balance between the the movement
itself the generation of the muscular movements that are required and
fuel utilization across the different sources of nerve muscle blood
heart and lungs so let's ask the question why would you fail on a long
run why would you quit well as you set out on that long run assuming
you have some glycogen in your liver and in your muscles you're going
to use that energy first even if it's very low intensity okay so we're
not talking about sprinting we're talking about heading out the door
or starting off on a marathon you're starting to assuming you have
some conditioning or even if you don't you're going to burn
carbohydrate you're going to burn glucose in the bloodstream you're
going to burn carbohydrate as those muscles contract those what we
call slow twitch muscles they're contracting they start burning up
fuel to make atp to continue to contract your mind is going to use
more or less energy depending on how much will power how much of a
fight you have to get into with yourself in order to generate the
effort i really want to underscore this if you're somebody that's
thinking maybe i go for the run maybe i don't go for the run i'll do
it at two o'clock okay 205 no i only want to go on the half hour or
maybe on the main hour and you're going through all that guess what
you're burning up useful energy that you could use either for the run
for example or for something else when we think about something hard
when we ruminate when we per perseverate on on an idea or on a
decision we are burning neural energy and neural energy is glucose and
epinephrine and all the things we talked about before so willpower in
part is the ability to devote resources to things and part of that is
making decisions to just either do it or not do it i'm not of the just
do it mindset i think there's a right time and a place to train but i
also think that it is not good in other words it utilizes excessive
resources to churn over decisions excessively and you probably burn as
much cognitive energy deciding about whether or not to do a given
training or not as you do in the actual training okay so we'll talk
more about how this long-duration effort can relate to mental
performance but the long-duration effort should be one set 12 minutes
or longer it could go for 30 minutes or 60 minutes or an hour we'll
talk about programming later in the episode this is going to be less
than 100 of your maximum oxygen uptake your heart rate is not going to
be through the ceiling or maxed out but it's all about efficiency of
movement that's what you're building when you go out for a run that's
30 minutes you are building the capacity to repeat that performance
the next time while being more efficient actually burning less fuel
and that might seem a little bit counterintuitive but every time you
do that run what you're doing is you're building up mitochondrial
density it's not so much about mitochondrial oxidation and respiration
you're building up mitochondrial density you're actually increasing
the amount of atp that you can create for a given bout of effort
you're becoming more efficient okay you're burning less fuel overall
doing the same thing that's really what these long slow distance or
long ballots of effort are really all about now why do this long
duration effort why&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=3420"&gt;Why Everyone Should Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries In Muscle &amp;amp; Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would you want to do it why is it good for you well it does something
very important which is that it builds the capillary beds within
muscles so let's talk a little bit about vasculature we haven't done
this too much yet but if you have seen the episode on supercharging
performance we talked about avas these arteriovenous astomosis where
blood moves from arteries directly into veins but that's unusual that
only takes place in the so-called glabrous skin of the of the palms
the face and the bottoms of the feet typically for most all other
areas of the body what happens is arteries bring blood to a given
tissue like a muscle and veins return that blood back to the heart
there are exceptions but in general and in between arteries and veins
are these little tiny what are called capillary beds or
microcapillaries so these are tiny little avenues like little tiny
streams and estuaries between the bigger arteries and veins now those
are actually contained within muscle and what's amazing is that you
can increase the number of them you can literally build new
capillaries you can create new little streams within your muscles and
the type of long duration effort that i was talking about before 12
minutes or more of steady effort is very useful for doing that and is
very useful in for increasing the mitochondria the energy producing
elements of the cells the actual muscle cells and the reason is when
blood arrives to muscles it has oxygen the muscles are going to use
some of that oxygen and then some of the deoxygenated blood is going
to be sent back to the heart and to the lungs now the more capillaries
that you build into those muscles the more oxygen available to those
muscles i don't want to get too much into the physics of fluid flow
but basically it's the difference between taking a hose and sticking
it into some dirt um just directly like and turning on the faucet at a
given rate uh the spigot rather or having a bunch of little hoses like
a sprinkler system that go out and irrigate the whole yard the
irrigation is equivalent to this capillary bed system and it's very
good at using energy sources within blood so the simple way to think
about this is when you go out for a run let's say it's the first run
you've done for a while and you go out for 12 or 15 minutes and
somewhere right around 20 minutes you're like that's it i just can't
continue well when you come back the next time to do that run you've
built endurance largely because you've built these capillary beds
you've expanded these little streams in which blood can deliver oxygen
to the muscles and so it's going to feel relatively straightforward to
either go a little bit quicker for the same duration the same distance
or to extend that run for another five to ten minutes so this long
duration work unlike muscular endurance like planks and everything
that we were talking about before is really about building the
capillary systems and the mitochondria the energy utilization systems
within the muscles themselves and that's very important to understand
it's distinctly different than say building the neurons that fire the
muscles the neurons are already there they're going to fire those
muscles just fine in fact if your life depended on it today you could
probably run a marathon you'd probably get injured it would be very
psychologically and physically painful i don't recommend you do that
unless you're trained for it but if you were to train properly for it
if you were to do long duration bouts of effort once or twice a week
or three times a week pretty soon it would become easy because you're
building these vascular micro beds or microvascular beds as they're
called okay so you're able to bring more energy to the muscles and
they're able to utilize more energy so that's long duration so we've
got&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=3660"&gt;Two Distinct Types of High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic &amp;amp; Aerobic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;muscular endurance and we've got long duration endurance and then
there are two kinds in between that in recent years have gotten a lot
of attention and excitement but most people are not distinguishing
between these two kinds of endurance and that's a shame because in
failing to distinguish between the two kinds of what we call high
intensity training sometimes called high intensity interval training
most people perhaps you are not getting nearly as much physical and
mental benefit out of high intensity training as you could so i want
to talk about the two kinds of high intensity interval training and
what each of them does for your brain and body and what sorts of
adaptations they cause because in doing that you can really start to
build up specific energy systems in your brain and body in ways that
are best serve you for your cognitive work and for other sorts of
things like strength and speed or hypertrophy or for running marathons
for that matter so there are two kinds of high intensity training for
endurance sometimes called high intensity interval training one is
anaerobic so-called anaerobic endurance so no oxygen and the other is
aerobic endurance both of which qualify as hiit high intensity
interval training so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=3740"&gt;Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio of 3:1 or 1:3; Quality of Repetitions is Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let's talk about anaerobic endurance first anaerobic endurance from a
protocol perspective is going to be 3 to 12 sets okay and these
repetitions and i'll talk about what the repetitions are are going to
be performed at whatever speed allows you to complete the work in good
safe form okay so it could be fast could be slow as the work continues
your repetitions may slow down or it may speed up chances are it's
going to slow down so what does this work what do these sets look like
remember long slow distance is one set muscular endurance is three to
five sets high intensity anaerobic endurance is going to be somewhere
between three and 12 sets and it's going to have a ratio of work to
rest of anywhere from three to one to one to five okay so what would a
three to one ratio set look like well it's going to be 30 seconds of
hard pedaling on the bike for instance or running or on the rower
these are just examples it could be in the pool swimming it could be
any number of things or air squats or you know or weighted squats if
you will provided you can manage that 30 seconds on 10 seconds off
that's a very brief rest so three to one is just a good example would
be 30 seconds on 10 seconds off the opposite extreme on that ratio be
one to five so 20 seconds on 100 seconds off so you do the work for 20
seconds then you rest 100 seconds now what's the difference what
should you do three to one ratio so 30 seconds on 10 seconds off or
should you do one to five 20 seconds on to 100 seconds off well that
will depend on whether or not the quality of the movement is important
to you so let's just take a look at the three to one ratio so in the
three to one ratio if you're going to do 30 seconds of hard pedaling
on a bike followed by 10 seconds so maybe one of these what they call
assault bikes and then you stop for 10 seconds and then repeat chances
are you will be able to do one two three four maybe even as many as 12
sets if you're really in good condition that you'll be able to do all
those because pedaling on the bike doesn't require a ton of skill and
if you do it incorrectly if your elbow flares out a little bit or
something it's very unlikely that you'll get injured unless it's
really extreme okay but the same movement done for instance with
kettlebells so 30 seconds on 10 seconds off the first set will
probably be in good form the second one will be in pretty good form
but let's say you're getting to the fifth and sixth set and you're
going 30 seconds on 10 seconds off chances are the quality of your
repetitions will degrade significantly and you increase the
probability that you're going to get injured or that you're going to
damage yourself in some way or that you can't complete the movement or
that some smaller muscles like your grip muscles might give out okay
so the quality of repetitions is going to drop considerably with the
three to one approach if you're just doing it for effort and we'll
talk about what this builds in your system in a moment that's fine but
for most people if quality of form is important so maybe this is uh
using weights maybe you're doing squats you're going to do 20 seconds
on and 100 seconds of rest maybe it's even a barbell loaded squat
maybe you're doing kettlebells maybe you've got some other resistance
there that's allowing you to do this what you'll find is that the
longer rest even though it's 20 seconds of intense effort followed by
a longer rest of about 100 seconds will allow you to perform more
quality repetitions safely over time so what does building anaerobic
endurance look like and then i'll tell you what it's actually good for
in the true practical sense what anaerobic endurance exercise
generally looks like is that if you decide to do this for the first
week you might do this two or three times a week maybe even just once
a week depending on the other things you're doing we'll talk about
programming at the end and you would generate just three sets so it
might be three sets of 20 seconds of hard effort followed by 100
seconds rest then you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort 100 seconds
rest 20 seconds whatever hard 100 seconds rest you might do that twice
a week and then each week you're adding one or two sets okay in doing
that you will build up what we call anaerobic endurance what is
anaerobic endurance well let's ask why&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=4020"&gt;Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate &amp;amp; Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we fail anaerobic endurance is going to be taking your system into
greater than 100 percent of your vo2 max it's going to be taking your
heart rate up very high and it's going to maximize your oxygen
utilization systems that is going to have effects that are going to
lead to fatigue at some point in the workout and that fatigue will
trigger an adaptation so let's ask what adaptation it's triggering
well it's triggering both mitochondrial respiration the ability of
your mitochondria to generate more energy by using more oxygen because
you're bringing so you're maxing out literally you're getting above
your vo2 max you're hitting that threshold of how much oxygen you can
use in your system one of the adaptations will be that your
mitochondria will shift such that they can use more oxygen and you're
going to also increase the capillary beds but not as much as you're
going to be able to increase the amount of neuron engagement of muscle
so normally when we start to hit fatigue when we're exhausted when
we're breathing really hard because the systems of the body are linked
and we there's a mental component to this as well a kind of
motivational component after that third or fourth or sixth set of you
know 20 seconds on 100 seconds off or if you're at the other extreme
30 seconds on and 10 seconds off there's going to be a component of
you want to stop and by pushing through and repeating another set
safely of course what you're doing is you are training the neurons to
be able to access more energy literally convert that into atp and for
the muscles therefore to access more energy and atp and the adaptation
is in the mitochondria's ability to use oxygen and this has tremendous
carryover effects for other types of exercise so while i know and
appreciate that people are using high intensity interval training of
this kind or similar in order to just like burn fat you know do their
workouts quote unquote it's very useful for building a capacity to
engage in short bouts of effort repeatedly to really lock in i don't
want to use the word focus because it's not strictly mental focus but
to be able to to generate short bouts of very intense work this can be
beneficial in competitive sports or team sports where there's a
sprinting component where the field opens up and you need to dribble
the ball down the field for instance and shoot on goal or where you're
playing tennis and it's a long rally and then all of a sudden somebody
really starts you know putting you back on your heels and you have to
really make the maximum amount of effort to run to the net and to get
the ball across that things of that sort okay there are a variety of
places where there's carryover from this type of training but it does
support endurance it's about muscle endurance it's about these muscles
ability to generate a lot of force in the short term but repeatedly
okay so that's the way to conceptualize this and it is different than
maximum power even though it feels like maximum effort it is not the
same as building power and speed into muscles those are distinctly
different protocols so the key elements again are that you're bringing
your breathing and your oxygen utilization way up above your max it's
not quite hitting failure but you're really pushing the system to the
point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin
another set you're not necessarily psychologically ready i'll talk
more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke
volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this
sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to
our lungs and other tissues i'm going to get very specific about how
to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's
happening at the level of the heart but i want to make sure i touch on
the fourth protocol which is high intensity aerobic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=4259"&gt;Aerobic HIIT; 1:1 Work:Rest Ratio, Tapping Into All Energy Utilization Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;conditioning so hit has these two forms anaerobic and aerobic and you
just heard about anaerobic high-intensity aerobic conditioning also
involves about three to twelve sets starting off of course with fewer
sets as you're getting into this training and then extending into more
sets as one parameter you could expand has again the same ratio of
three to one so 30 seconds on 10 seconds off or one to five 20 seconds
on 100 seconds off or a very powerful tool for building up aerobic
conditioning is a one-to-one ratio a one-to-one ratio is powerful for
building on average most of the energy systems involving remember we
have these nerve muscle blood heart and lungs a one to a one to one
ratio might be you run a mile and however long that takes let's say it
takes you six minutes or seven minutes then you rest for an equivalent
amount of time then you repeat it and then you rest for an equivalent
amount of time so you might run first mile is let's say seven minutes
then you rest for seven minutes then you run a mile again and it might
take eight minutes and you rest for eight minutes and you continue
that for a total of four miles of work for four miles of running work
i should say or seven miles of work you can build this up many people
find that using this type of training allows them to do things like go
run half marathons in marathons even though prior to the race date
they've never actually run a half marathon or marathon now that might
seem incredible it's like how could it be that running a mile on and
then and then resting for running a mile and then resting for an
equivalent amount of time running them out resting for equivalent
amount of time for seven miles allows you to run continuously for 13
miles or for 26 miles well i'm not discouraging people from ever doing
the long duration endurance i think that is very important but it's
because it builds up so many of these energy utilization systems it
really teaches you to engage excuse me the nerve to muscle firing it
improves atp and mitochondrial function in muscle it allows the blood
to deliver more oxygen to the muscle and to your brain and i'll
explain how that is and it allows your heart to deliver more oxygen
overall and it builds a tremendous lung capacity and we will talk
about exactly how to breathe and how to build lung capacity both for
sake of warming up and for performance so what would this look like
and when should you do this um well it's really a question for these
workouts of asking how much work can one do in 8 to 12 minutes right
and then rest and then repeat how much work can you do for eight to
twelve minutes then rest and then repeat and how many times should you
do this well this is the sort of thing it's pretty intense and so you
would probably only want to do this two maybe three times a week if
you're not doing many other things i will talk about how this program
can be moved in with other forms of training but i'll just give you a
little hint now it's very clear and it's described in the review
article referred to and we will link another article as well that
concurrent training doing strength training and the endurance training
of any of the four cons that i'm describing today can be done you can
program those in the same week but you want to get four and ideally
six or even better 24 hours between these workouts because it is very
hard for instance to do a one-to-one mile repeats like run a mile rest
for equivalent time run a mile rest for equivalent time to do that two
or three times a week and also do weight training before or do a long
run afterwards that would quickly lead to breakdown for most people
unless you have very very good energy utilization systems you're a
really kind of advanced or elite athlete and or dare i say you're
using tools to enhance your performance at the level of blood or
hormones and i'm actually going to talk about those at the end and why
they work so we have four kinds of endurance muscular endurance we
have long duration endurance we have high intensity interval training
of two kinds anaerobic and aerobic and this last type the aerobic one
works best it seems if you kind of do this one-to-one ratio so how
would you use these and what are they actually doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=4520"&gt;Building A Stronger Heart &amp;amp; Better Brain: Eccentric Loading the Heart: Stroke Volume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let's talk about the heart and the lungs and oxygen because that's
something that we can all benefit from understanding and it will
become very clear in that discussion why this type of training is very
useful even for non-athletes in order to improve oxygenation and
energy utilization of the brain and the heart the brain and the heart
are probably the two most important systems that you need to take care
of in your life yes your musculature needs to be maintained if you
want to build it that's up to you but you should try and maintain your
musculature but maintaining or enhancing brain function and
cardiovascular function it's absolutely clear our key for health and
longevity in the short and long term and the sorts of training i
talked about today has been shown again and again and again to be very
useful for enhancing the strength of the mind yes i'll talk about that
as well as the health of the brain and the body so let's talk about
the sorts of adaptations that are happening in your brain and body
that are so beneficial in these different forms of training if you are
breathing hard and your heart is beating hard so this would be
certainly in the high intensity anaerobic and aerobic conditioning
because you're getting up near your vo2 max in high intensity aerobic
conditioning and you're exceeding your vo2 max in high intensity
anaerobic conditioning what's going to happen is as of course your
heart beats faster your blood is going to be circulating faster in
principle oxygen utilization in muscles is going to go up and over
time not long very quickly what will happen when those capillary beds
start to expand we talked about that but in addition because of the
amount of blood that's being returned to the heart when you engage in
these really intense bouts of effort repeatedly the amount of blood
being returned to the heart actually causes an eccentric loading of
one of the muscular walls of the heart so your heart is muscle it's
cardiac muscle we have skeletal muscle attached to our bones and we
have cardiac muscle which is our heart when more blood is being
returned to the heart because of the additional work that your muscles
and nerves are doing it actually has the effect of creating an
eccentric loading a kind of pushing of the wall the left i realize i'm
not using the strict anatomy here but i don't want to get into all the
features of the structural features of the heart but the left
ventricle essentially getting slammed back and then having to push
back in a kind of eccentric loading of the cardiac muscle and the
muscle thickens but not because the heart thickens overall it's
actually a strengthening of the cardiac muscle in a way that increases
what we call stroke volume meaning as more blood is returned to the
heart there's an adaptation where the heart muscle actually gets
stronger and therefore can pump more blood per stroke per beat and as
it does that it delivers because blood cont contains glucose and
oxygen and other things it delivers more fuel to your muscles which
allows you to do yet more work per unit time okay so when we hear that
oh you know uh so-and-so has a or maybe you have a nice low heart rate
that you know maybe you're one of these really extreme folks like 30
or 40 beats per minute although most people are sitting at 50 60 70 80
that's your resting heart rate if you exercise regularly and you do
long duration aerobic work your heart rate will start to go down your
resting heart rate it will increase the stroke volume of your heart if
you do this high intensity type training where your heart is beating
very hard so maybe the one-to-one ratio mile run repeats that i
described a minute ago so you do that twice a week for three or four
and i said it could go all the way up to 12 sets which is a lot i
don't recommend people start there pretty soon the stroke volume of
your heart will really increase and as a consequence you can deliver
more fuel to your muscles and to your brain and you will notice that
you can do more work meaning you can do the same work you were doing a
few days or weeks ago with relative ease your cognitive functioning
will improve this has been shown again and again because there's an
increase in vasculature literally capillary beds within the brain the
hippocampus areas that support memory but also areas of the brain that
support respiration that support focus that support effort this isn't
often discussed but the ability to deliver more blood and therefore
more glucose remember neurons run on glucose and oxygen to the brain
is a big feature of why exercise of the kind i'm describing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=4810"&gt;Resistance &amp;amp; Weight Training: Useless for the Brain? What Is Good For the Brain?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;helps with brain function now weight training does have some positive
effects on brain function also when i say weight training i'm really i
should be more specific i really am referring to strength and
hypertrophy training strengthen hypertrophy training especially if
it's of the sort where you get into the burn as we talked about last
episode and you start generating lactate as a hormonal signal that can
benefit your brain etc it can have positive effects on the brain and
frankly there haven't been as many studies of resistance training
strength and hypertrophy training on brain function mainly because
most of those experiments are done in mice or primates non-human
primates i should say and um it's hard to get mice to do resistance
training okay it's hard to get humans to do resistance training it's
definitely hard to get mice to do resistance training there are ways
to do it but it's hard to get them to do say you know three sets of
eight on the deadlift and then do some curls and then do some chin ups
and this kind of thing okay it's pretty easy to get a mouse to run on
a treadmill and you can set the tension on that treadmill to make it
so that it's easier or harder for the mouse to turn that wheel so
that's one of the reasons however it's very clear and you should now
understand intuitively why the kind of standard strength and
hypertrophy type workouts are not going to activate the blood
oxygenation and the stroke volume increases for the heart that the
sorts of training i'm talking about today will it just doesn't have
the same positive effects now that isn't to say that if you just
weight train that you'll be dumb or that you'll lose your your memory
over time you might but it is to say that endurance work in particular
the high intensity and long duration work that i've talked about today
the two high intensity protocols and the long duration work has been
shown again and again and again to have positive effects on brain
function not through the addition of new neurons sorry to break break
it to you but that's not a major event in the exercised or non-
exercised human brain for reasons we can talk about in a future
episode but it still has many positive effects through the delivery of
things like igf-1 but also just through plane oxygenation of the brain
and the way it promotes the development of microvasculature to devel
to excuse me to deliver neurons more nutrients if neurons don't get
oxygen and glucose they do die unless there's another fuel source like
ketones which can replace the glucose if you don't give oxygen to
neurons if you don't deliver enough to them you get what's called
ischemia you get little microstrokes so the type of exercise i'm
talking about today in generating intense heart rate increases
provided that's safe for you to do breathing hard that's going to
deliver oxygen and blood increased stroke volume of the heart and is
going to improve brain function that's been supported by many many
quality peer-reviewed studies so that's one form of positive
adaptation i also talked about just sort of performance adaptations
how doing high intensity aerobic conditioning of the you know mild
repeats type training can actually improve your ability to do long
bouts of intense work it also seems like it dovetails or is compatible
with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=5005"&gt;The Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; How Long to Wait Between Workouts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;resistance training that's aimed towards strength and hypertrophy now
in full disclosure the data seem to indicate that if people just
weight train or train for strength so three reps um rest five minutes
three reps of heavy weights etc yeah you'll get much stronger than you
would if you're doing things like you know five repetitions up to 12
or 12 to 25 reps and you're you know and you're going out for long
jogs there's always going to be a compromise in adaptations
unfortunately it does seem like you can do concurrent training as i
mentioned before if you allow anywhere from four to six or ideally 24
hours between workouts as i mentioned in the previous episode if you
want to know if you are recovered from a workout a great way to do
that is to apply the carbon dioxide tolerance test which is four
breaths in and out inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale
exhale then a big inhale and then a slow controlled exhale if that
slow controlled exhale is 60 seconds or longer it means that your
parasympathetic your calming nervous system is under your control and
it's likely i should say likely that systemically your whole nervous
system has recovered from whatever it is that you've been doing and
experiencing in life including work and relationships if not you might
want to take a rest day dare i say or costello's on is what he's 10
now i think he's on his 12 000th rest day um most people need i should
say one to two full rest days per week i know there are people gonna
say that's ridiculous and okay maybe you have uh amazing recovery
abilities it also depends on training intensity many people benefit
from having one or two full rest days per week at least one some
people don't need to but if you are not able to extend that exhale on
the carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds or so 45 seconds 60
seconds chances are your so-called sympathetic nervous system your
stress system is chronically elevated and you're not really putting
the brake on that system enough and that's a subconscious thing there
are ways that you can accelerate recovery but i would encourage you to
listen to the previous episode it's time stamped for how to assess
recovery so how often to program these things will depend on the other
things you're doing i think it's perfectly reasonable to do this type
of training with other types of training and i'll talk about a variety
of combinations of those toward the end of the episode i do want to
talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=5145"&gt;Breathing During Endurance, Explosive and Weight Training: Nose, Mouth, Gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about how to deliver more energy and oxygen these are tools that are
extremely useful i believe and that are grounded in physiology the
three things i'd like to talk about are how to breathe what to do
immediately after training and hydration and i promise i will get back
into programming and sort of protocols but i these are vitally
important to your ability to perform endurance work in particular and
they're grounded in how neurons and blood and oxygen and your heart
work together so let's first talk about breathing or respiration we
breathe a couple of different ways but let's just remind ourselves why
we breathe we breathe to bring oxygen into our system and we breathe
to get rid of carbon dioxide and we need both oxygen and carbon
dioxide in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work
it's not that oxygen is good and carbon dioxide is bad they have to be
present in the appropriate ratios so one thing that is very clear is
our ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles and to our brain is
going to be important for our ability to generate muscular effort
especially of the kind of was talking about today but also weight
training and other forms of skill based effort etc and our ability to
think if you're holding your breath for too long if you're breathing
too much if you're what they call over breathing or under breathing if
you're shallow breathing if you're mouth breathing these are all
things that can really impede mental and physical performance so let's
make it really simple and then i promise to do a future episode all
about respiration there are two main sources of air for your body and
it's air coming in through your nose and air coming in through your
mouth in general nasal breathing is better it scrubs the air of
bacteria and viruses you have a microbiome in your nose that benefits
there are a number of reasons it's also just a more efficient system
believe it or not even though it feels like you can gulp more air with
your mouth getting good at nasal breathing is useful a gear system of
the type that brian mckenzie and colleagues have developed i think is
a good way to conceptualize this if you're doing long duration work
try and do it all nasal breathing if you have deviated septum it's
probably because you don't nasal breathe enough mouth breathing is
something that you know many people suffer from it you're more prone
to infections it's not as in efficient etc there is a place for mouth
breathing however it's usually if you need to do a strong exhale often
times you can discard more volume through the mouth unless you're very
trained at nasal breathing so if you're doing high intensity training
a good way to conceptualize this is to exhale on the max effort and
then to inhale on the less intense part so that might be as you're
generating the movement you know you in the concentric part of the
movement you exhale right just like on a bat swing or something like
that or you know fighters and martial artists do this differently
depending on how they were trained and the different purposes but the
kind of like or the kind of exhaling um during the effort and then
inhaling on the portion of the repetition that is not the highest
effort portion usually that's the eccentric phase of anything
involving weights or rowing and things of that sort so nasal breathing
is great but as you increase the intensity of your endurance work you
will need to incorporate the mouth so a gear system would look
something like first gear would be just nasal breathing or second gear
would also be just nasal breathing but with more effort third gear
again power speed endurance has a lot more about this you can go to
their website i think it's a very intelligent way to conceptualize
this um as you go into more max effort then you're going to you know
third and fourth and fifth gear and at some point you're not thinking
about nose or mouth you're just trying to hang on for dear life and
complete the work safely and that means breathe through uh whatever uh
orifice uh works for you so that's one aspect nose versus mouth the
other aspect is whether or not you're using your ribs the intercostal
muscles are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=5390"&gt;Intercostals &amp;amp; Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Up Intercostals Is Useful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these muscles that the bruce lee had these you know remarkable
intercostal muscles that allow you to lift the rib cage or the
diaphragm which is a skeletal muscle that sits below the lungs just to
remind you when you inhale the diaphragm moves down when you exhale
the diaphragm moves up okay here's something that most people don't do
and would benefit tremendously from and i can say this because andy
galpin's lab has done work on this exploring how warming up the
intercostals and the nerve to diaphragm pathways before any kind of
endurance work or in the first few minutes of endurance work can allow
you to breathe more deeply and to deliver more oxygen to the blood and
excuse me end to the muscles and to be able to do more work more
efficiently so what that involves is sometimes sitting sometimes
standing and just really concentrating on two things we always hear
about how we should diaphragmatic breathe and that means our belly
moves out when we inhale so our our stomach expands but also expanding
the intercostals which means actually raising the ribs chest breathing
we're all told that you know in yoga class don't breathe with your&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=5460"&gt;Increasing Motivation &amp;amp; Adrenaline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chest this but actually that is is warming up the intercostal muscles
so this is also a great way to generate adrenaline if you do it a
little bit intensely so let's say you're feeling un motivated to train
i don't particularly like doing endurance training until i'm actually
doing it um so i i use and benefit from having a practice where i'll
just sit there and for about three minutes i'll just breathe very
deeply trying to raise my chest as much as i can for maybe a minute
and then expanding my contracting my diaphragm and expanding my
stomach outward when i inhale by the end of that you're actually
delivering more oxygen to your system um my lab has looked at this in
a totally different context andy's lab has looked at it in the context
of physical performance so warming up the breathing muscles should
make sense given that you now know that muscles and neurons need
glucose and they need oxygen in order to function and so that's a
great warm-up you can also do this while walking or while getting on
the bike and starting to pedal really starting to think about warming
up the breathing system and then you can decide if you want to do pure
nasal or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing and so on so
that's something that we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=5530"&gt;Eliminating the “Side Cramp” With Physiological Sighs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don't often hear about the other one the other tool rather that i've
talked about in a previous episode i'll just mention again is some
people when they do endurance type work they get a stitch in their
side they feel like they've got a side cramp very rarely is it
actually a skeletal muscular cramp it's oftentimes it's a referenced
pain of the phrenic nerve that innervates the liver so the phrenic
nerve is responsible for the movement of the diaphragm it is a very
important system but it has a number of what we call collateral so it
branches to other organs runs over other organs sometimes when we're
breathing shallow and we are in physical motion and we're engaging in
physical effort we'll feel that side stitch we think oh i've got a
cramp or maybe i'm dehydrated or maybe i need to run with my hands
over my head my head excuse me typically you can relieve that side
cramp which isn't a cramp at all that side stitch by doing the double
inhale exhale really breathing deeply and then sneaking a little bit
more air in that's a double kind of firing or what we call volley of
action potential sent from the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm which
will also activate that collateral that branch literally of the nerve
that innervates the liver and then when you exhale you offload a bunch
of carbon dioxide but if you repeat that a few times often in fact for
me every time but often what will happen is that side stitch will just
naturally disappear just means you're not breathing properly your the
phrenic nerve is is firing in a way that's kind of aggravating that
referenced pain there's nothing kind of voodoo or mysterious about
this it just has to do with the way that the different nerves uh
travel in the body so as you set out on your run or maybe you're going
to do some muscular endurance work or high intensity work warming up
the intercostals warming up the diaphragm is is good and there there
are exercises there is work that you can do to strengthen the
intercostals and to strengthen the diaphragm during bouts of this kind
of effort and i would say that one of the ways that you can do that
best is by really focusing on getting the maximum diaphragmatic
expansion and chest lifting what we're all told now not to do don't
you know don't chest breathe belly breathe the intercostals are there
for a reason and they are perfectly good at filling your lungs they
work best when they collaborate with your diaphragm but when you're
starting to fatigue to start to really inhale deeply and try and
really expand those to deliver more oxygen to your system while we're
talking about delivering more oxygen to your system i want to share
with you a useful tool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=5685"&gt;Accelerating Through “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone Use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that will now make total sense mechanistically why it works which is
often times when we are on a long run or in long duration bouts of
effort we will hit the so-called wall right we will bonk i think they
used to call it or maybe do they still call it that costello he's
asleep we bonk we just we think no we can't continue it's a curious
thing as to whether or not that's neural or whether or not it's fuel-
based there's certainly going to be a psychological or motivational
component but one way that you can reveal this kind of extra gear the
capacity to push on is by understanding the way that different muscle
fibers use energy differently remember the fast twitch phosphor
creatine system and the slow twitch system that relies mainly on
lipids and glucose okay well even if you don't remember all that if
you've been running steadily for a long time and you're starting to
fatigue and you feel like it's time to quit you may have not tapped
into an alternative fuel source one thing that you can do is you can
actually increase your speed this is also true of work where you're
doing repetitions with kettlebells or something you can start to
increase your speed so run faster pedal faster row faster swim faster
not all out sprint but in doing that you're shifting the muscles and
the nerves over towards utilizing a separate fuel source or a distinct
fuel source maybe the phosphocreatine system if it's a quick bout of
intense acceleration or maybe it's a combination of lipids and
carbohydrates in your system that weren't available to you prior now
of course if you completely deplete your liver glycogen you completely
deplete everything you're only going to be running on stored fuel and
fats and and eventually you'll start metabolizing protein muscles
themselves but this is a kind of a a unique way to realize that oh you
weren't uh you weren't out of energy at all you were just over relying
on one fuel source and this is the reason why especially elite
athletes are starting to both rely on carbohydrates so they're doing
the whole carb depletion then carb loading thing they're loading up
their liver and their muscles with plenty of glycogen by eating pastas
and rice and stuff before races but they are also ingesting ketones
during races during long ballots of effort because ketones can be a
quick form of energy there's no reason why you can't use ketones if
they are taken exogenous ketones and carbohydrate and in combination
remember the body is accustomed to using multiple fuel sources fatty
acids carbohydrates all these things it's only in the you know kind of
internet age that we think in terms of oh well you're either keto or
you're burning sugar or you're you know fat adapted or you're fat
fasting or fast fasting or fat fatting costello woke up when i said
fat fatting i'm not talking about you costello so the the point is
that your body is used to using multiple fuel sources so if you're
kind of hitting that wall sometimes accelerating can actually allow
you to tap into a new fuel source or combination of fuel sources just
based on the way that muscles use fuel so that's another tool the
other thing that's really important to think about in terms of
endurance type work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=5870"&gt;Hydration: Why Hydrate, How To Hydrate, &amp;amp; How Much Fluid To Drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is hydration and i think hydration is important for all forms of
physical work and exercise not just endurance the deal with hydration
is that we've been taught about hydration all wrong but let's remember
what neurons work on what what do they use in order to fire well they
certainly need water right we need water in our system i should say
but they remember they use electrolyte sodium and potassium to
generate those action potentials to actually get neurons to contract
to be able excuse me muscles to contract and for our brain to function
and to be able to think typically typically we're going to lose
anywhere from one to five pounds of water per hour of exercise and
that's going to vary tremendously it's going to vary on weather it's
going to vary on intensity probably more like five pounds if it's hot
day and you're exercising very intensely so about one to five pounds
per hour now you know how much you weigh so if you think about your
weight in pounds once you lose about one to four percent of your body
weight in water you're going to experience about a 20 to 30 percent
reduction in work capacity in your ability to generate effort of any
kind strength endurance etc you are also going to experience a
significant drop in your ability to think and perform mental
operations so hydration is key now many people have been told well if
you urinate and your urine is clear well then you're hydrated enough
sometimes that's true sometimes that's not true also and this isn't a
topic i enjoy um discussing but urine is a biological phenomenon it's
actually filtered blood um every once in a while if there's a kid and
it's a family friend i'll say did you know that your pee is actually
filtered blood and they usually kind of go wide-eyed but then they go
oh that's kind of cool like kids have this natural curiosity about
blood and pee and stuff that's not contaminated by our preconceived
notions of those things being gross because urine being filtered blood
can give you some indication as to whether or not you're hydrated
enough or not and in order to really assess that it's not going to be
sufficient to urinate into another volume of water and assess whether
or not your urine is very dark or very light it actually requires
urinating into a small volume and saying well is it darker or lighter
than before it's not something you really want to do most places um
the etiquette of most gyms and environments is not suitable for that
but one of the things that you can just do is you can figure well i'm
going to lose one to five pounds of water per hour you can show up to
exercise reasonably hydrated with electrolytes so potassium sodium and
magnesium are really key yes it's true you can die from drinking too
much water in particular because it forces you if you drink too much
water you'll excrete too many electrolytes and your brain will shut
off you'll actually your heart will stop functioning properly so you
don't want to over consume water to the extreme either but there are a
number of equations that go into figuring out how much water you need
based on how intense you're training etc body size etc just remember
you burn you lose excuse me about one to five pounds of of water per
hour depending on how hot it is and how intensely you're exercising
once your body weight drops by one to four percent so you can just
figure well if you lose five pounds per hour you exercise for two
hours let's say you're about 200 pounds that's about 10 okay well you
want to replace that before you very quickly or not you want to
replace that all along before you start experiencing this massive
20-30 reduction in work capacity of muscles in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=6095"&gt;“The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the brain a simple formula what i call the galpin equation hereafter
referred to as the galpin equation is a formula that gets you close to
the exact amount that you would want that dr andy galpin came up with
which is your body weight in pounds divided by the number 30 and that
is how many ounces you should drink for every 15 minutes of exercise
so once again the galloping equation your body weight in pounds
divided by 30 that's the amount of of fluid to drink in ounces right
every 15 minutes of exercise now if you are sweating a lot you may
need more okay if you're already very well hydrated you may need less
but that's a good rule of thumb to begin and to start to understand
the relationship between hydration and performance there is a
phenomenon in which gastric emptying the ability to move stuff out of
your gut including water and electrolytes out of your gut and into the
bloodstream and for delivery to the tissues of your body for effort is
hindered when you get above 70 of your vo2 max in other words when
you're doing high intensity training sometimes people experience that
ingesting water during intense training is difficult it is something
that can be actually trained up it's a matter of learning to kind of
relax the your abdominal muscles and there's some other aspects of
adaptation that will allow you to drink during higher intensity work
as galpin says don't try and ingest fluids when you're working out or
competing at higher than 70 of vo2 max if you've never done it before
you want to train up this capacity people can learn how to consume
fluids during a race or consume fluids during bouts of exercise that
are very intense and a lot of people don't want to do that because
they don't want to have to stop to urinate etc but given the crucial
role of hydration for muscular performance and for brain performance
it seems that if you're going to be doing a lot of high intensity
interval training of the various kinds we talked about today or high
intensity training of any kind that hydration is key and learning or
in other words getting your system to adapt to ingesting fluids in the
middle of these workouts is something that seems beneficial at least
to me in terms of the trade-off between being dehydrated and the
somewhat discomfort of maybe drinking some fluids so you sip small
amounts of fluid initially and then you're able to take bigger and
bigger gulps as time goes on and pretty soon um you're able to drink
mid-set or be excuse me not mid-set please don't do that between sets
and your workout or while you're still breathing hard after a mile
repeat or something of that sort without much disruption or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=6260"&gt;Boosting Mitochondrial Density With Cold; Wait 6 Hours Before Cold/Between Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any at all to your performance last episode we talked about how to
assess recovery and things that you might want to do to improve
recovery how exposure to ice baths and cold showers can reduce
inflammation which can be great for recovery but can inhibit some of
the adaptations for strength and hypertrophy because inflammation
isn't good or bad inflammation isn't like a nice person or a mean
person it's both it's a great thing for stimulating adaptations but
you don't want it around too long and so we suggested that you not do
ice baths within probably six hours of any training where the goal was
hyper hypertrophy or strength training there is some evidence that
getting yourself into an ice bath or cold shower after endurance
training can actually improve the mitochondrial uh aspects of
endurance exercise that you can get improvements in mitochondrial
density and you can get improvements in mitochondrial respiration by
doing that afterwards and that it can facilitate recovery that's still
a bit of a controversial area i do think that what i mentioned earlier
that waiting at least six hours and probably more like 24 hours
between workouts is a good idea that getting at least one full day of
rest each week for some people that'll be two i have to say i'm one of
these people that after two days of absolutely no exercise i do
perform better consistently across all aspects of physical performance
and mentally i feel better as well even though i loathe to take those
days off unless i'm really exhausted it does seem to help my training
some people can train seven days a week and they're fine i think it
just is there's a lot of individual variation you want to work on
sleep and maximizing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=6360"&gt;Accelerating Recovery with 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift After Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sleep for recovery nutrition of course as well i talked about sleep in
the first four episodes of the podcast so if you have trouble with
sleep definitely check out those episodes it's very clear and a number
of sports teams um even some folks that i work with uh and andy galpin
and others are starting to incorporate a what's called a
parasympathetic down regulation after training of any kind as a way to
accelerate recovery and enable you to do more work in other words get
back to work out sooner what is parasympathetic down regulation it
means finishing your your training and instead of just hopping on the
phone or hopping into your car and and um heading off to take five
minutes minimum maybe ideally more like 10 or 20 but for sake of time
five minutes minimum and doing just some slow pure nasal long exhale
devoted breathing we're lying down and just kind of zoning out that it
seems can accelerate recovery and allow you to get back into other
types of work mental work or physical work more quickly which makes
total sense because remember your nervous system and recovery and work
is a local phenomenon which muscles were you using you know were you
using your your glutes your hams and your and your back or where
you're using your shoulders etc but it's also a systemic thing it's
also about those neurons and the locus ceruleas that are releasing
epinephrine you want to quiet all that down after training you want to
really just zone out think costello channel your inner costillo and
just mellow out for five to 20 minutes and then move into the rest of
your day five minutes should be manageable even if it's just sitting
in the car with your eyes closed doing that down regulation breathing
i think you'll see big benefits in terms of allowing yourself to come
back sooner do more work over time and just perform and feel better
generally as well as be able to think about other things besides the
just how much the previous workout kind of beat you up a couple more
things i think are going to be useful and i do want to just pack these
in because we are closing out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=6480"&gt;Leveraging The Visual System During Effort, Milestones; Dilation &amp;amp; Contraction; Pacing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the month on physical performance and that's about programming and
about pacing and the kind of mental aspects of endurance so let's
start with pacing and mental aspects of endurance i learned from a
friend and colleague here at the podcast that who's very active in
triathlon and marathon and other knows a lot about that whole world
and the competitive landscape there that pacing and literally physical
pacers of a laser on the ground or visualizing or having a pace car or
a pace runner in front is actually not allowed in many competitions
and if those are present doesn't allow the race times to qualify as
legitimate record-holding times and that's very interesting to me
because what we know is that the visual system has this capacity to
switch back and forth between what we call panoramic vision where
we're not really focused on anything things are just flowing past us
or our eyes are just kind of zoned out so i can do this right now and
you won't be able to tell but i'm looking at the corners of the room i
see costillo down there on the floor i see my podcast team here and i
can also see the microphone i can see myself in this environment
that's panoramic vision whereas if i draw my eyes to one location like
right there in the center of the camera it's what's called a virgin's
eye movement so i'm contracting my visual window the contraction of
the visual window when that's done is the same thing that would happen
if i was tracking say a pace car or a pace runner or a laser on the
ground the mirror bringing our eyes together to what we call a
vergence point has the impact of triggering the activation of neural
circuits in the thalamus things like zona and serta if you really want
to know what their names are of these brain areas as well as in the
brain stem that activate the so-called alertness system things like
locus ceruleus whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us into states
of relaxation you can actually leverage this during your runs let's
say you're out for a long run or you're swimming or you're cycling
this is probably easiest to imagine out of the water but you probably
do in the water as well if you focus your attention on a landmark that
you're going to run to you'll find that it's much easier than if you
don't actually have a set milestone or landmark that you're going to
run to however if you were to continue that repeatedly just going
milestone after milestone after milestone you would feel more mentally
fatigued and you would actually be able to generate less work overall
one thing that can be useful is focusing on a milestone running to
that milestone or biking whatever it is the activity happens to be and
then dilating your field of view to relax the system and then
continuing again so it's this kind of active contraction or of the
visual window and then dilation of the visual window contraction the
visual window allows you to generate more effort but there's a cost to
doing that because neurons consume energy and now you know how they do
that whereas dilation allows you to essentially be more efficient
right now pacing is not allowed or having a pace or a visual pacer
because it does allow you to access systems in the brain and body that
allow you to create more energy more effort and so i find it
interesting that i think in a kind of subconscious genius the race
officials and the the governing bodies of these of these races have
said okay sure having a pacer there or someone in front you can draft
off of them there's actually a kind of a aerodynamic effect of having
someone in front of you that makes it easier to run in the wake of
their of their airstream so to speak same is true in cycling this is
why the cycling teams are so good at maneuvering in packs in very
specific ways you can go faster with less effort if you're drafting as
it's called behind somebody but as well where you place your vision
will allow you to generate more effort and so it's interesting that
they've taken out this kind of um if you will performance enhancing
tool i imagine and i have to imagine it's the appropriate word here
that ra good runners good cyclists have the ability to create a kind
of pacer in their mind's eye i have to imagine that they're not just
completely allowing their attention to drift although they do that
when they want to be in highly efficient mode generating effort
without having to tax their mental capacity and remember mental
capacity is neural energy and consumes glucose energy that they could
devote to the functioning of their body but that when needed that they
can focus their energy in and actually kind of chase a mental pacer or
pick milestones so this is a mental game that you can play as well
it's a little bit hard to do in the context of weightlifting in the
gym it's more of a moving through space kind of thing but some people
do this by counting reps etc i think it's especially suitable for
endurance type of exercise especially done outside one of the reasons
i hate running on a treadmill is it just feels like it's never ending
and i i've never tried one of these peloton things i try and avoid
looking at screens as much as i possibly can but if you try this next
time you're out for a run or a swim what you'll find is that you have
a capacity to engage a system of higher energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=6790"&gt;The Physiological Basis of Your “Extra Gear”, Accessing Your “Kick”, Steve Prefontaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;output when you focus your eyes on a particular location but you want
to use that judiciously because your goal of course is to become
efficient at moving through space over time and not taxing your brain
and body to the point where you arrive at the end of that unless it's
race day just completely tapped out so that's a kind of interesting
aspect of running if you're a fan of running which i am and you get
the chance to look at any of the documentaries or docu-dramas made
about excuse me about steve prefontaine it was clear that he was
mostly in a battle with himself but that he was also a highly
competitive individual and you'll see this in some of his races i do
encourage you to look some of those up on on youtube or see the
docudramas they're quite good where he ran that the essentially was 12
laps on a track it's essentially the five it is the 5 000 meter race
which essentially three three miles and he essentially tried to sprint
the whole thing which is ridiculous actually knowing what you know
today you'll realize that steve prefontaine basically was pulling from
strength speed power muscular endurance long duration effort high
intensity aerobic anaerobic has sort of tried to maximize every fuel
system and you'll see that in the the races that he runs but that when
runners are nearing the final laps the so-called bell lap of a race
they'll often look to one another to see where somebody is obviously
to assess their progress and and how close somebody is but when
somebody gets passed oftentimes you'll see someone access this
mysterious kick this ability to tap into some additional gear that
allows them to run forward or faster when they themselves actually
thought that they were maxed out so someone could be running for the
finish line they're convinced they're going to win they're going max
effort or at least they perceive max ever someone passes them and all
of a sudden max effort has changed because of that visual target they
are able to access higher levels of speed and output and effort and
performance they don't always catch up to that person and win but
having a target a milestone is a powerful way that we can generate
more force and energy in anything and the visual system is the way
that we bring those milestones into our brain which then brings about
epinephrine which brings about neural firing which allows us to access
whatever resources happen to be available to us so i find this
fascinating because people often wonder like where does the kick come
from where is this kind of gift of an additional gear where is that
deeper resource and we often express it and talk about it in kind of
psychological terms like heart or willpower or that something kind of
got transplanted into us or descended into us and not to remove any of
the spiritual aspects of of sport or running or effort of the human uh
you know heart but it's very clear that the nervous system when it has
a specific&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=6960"&gt;Programming Examples; Concurrent Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;visual target can generate the sorts of intense effort that it
couldn't otherwise and it sometimes even comes as a surprise to the
person generating the effort i promised that i would talk about
programming meaning when and how many times a week to do the various
workouts related to endurance and how to merge those with other types
of exercise that you might be doing for strength or yoga or other
things that you might be doing like work and other things unrelated to
exercise since that's a vast space with many different parameters and
you all have different lives and lifestyles and backgrounds with
fitness etc what i'm going to do is i'm going to put three different
levels if you will or protocols that one could adopt in a link on the
show note so in the caption on youtube if you click on that link
you'll be able to see three possible combinations of endurance work
strength and hypertrophy work or endurance work flexibility and
hypertrophy work that are grounded in many of the major publications
that dr andy galpin and colleagues and other people have described
including this review that's also linked there on concurrent training
and how one can use concurrent training meaning training for endurance
training for strength training for hypertrophy training for all these
different things without having to train constantly every day twice a
day etc so if you are interested in taking the protocols that you
learned about in this episode and in previous episodes and combining
those we've placed them there for you as a completely zero cost
resource please understand they are not holy costello agrees they are
not holy there will be variation in terms of what people can tolerate
what they have time for but i think they'll serve as a useful
guideline in getting started or in continuing with and expanding on
existing endurance work strength work hypertrophy work and so forth
just really quickly we didn't talk about supplements much today in the
previous episodes i talked about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=7077"&gt;Caffeine, Magnesium Malate to Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the phosphocreatine system and supplementing with creatine talked
about beta-alanine for kind of moderate duration work you know really
the only things that have been shown to really improve endurance work
across the four varieties of endurance work i described today they
have essentially two forms one are stimulants so things like caffeine
will definitely improve endurance work and power output there's a
little bit of evidence that caffeine intake can actually inhibit the
function of the creatine system but it's just one study but that's
interesting if you want to read that study you can put caffeine into
examine.com and it will take you to that study many people get sore
after workouts in particular workouts that involve a lot of eccentric
loading or workouts that are very novel where they've kind of pushed
it instead of moving gradually as i suggest into say high intensity
anaerobic endurance work of three sets of 20 seconds on 100 second
rest maybe you get overambitious and you do eight sets in which case
you're extremely sore certain forms of magnesium in particular
magnesium malate m-a-l-a-t-e have been shown to be useful for removing
or reducing the amount of delayed onset muscle soreness that form of
magnesium is distinctly different than the sorts of magnesium that are
good for getting us into sleep things like magnesium 3 and 8 and by
glycinate and then there's this whole thing about beet powder and beet
juices and things that increase nitric oxide and allow for more
vasodilation and therefore delivery of blood to muscle and neurons and
other tissues for long bouts of endurance work some people like beet
juice and the related compounds that increase arginine and
vasodilation some people don't some people don't feel good when they
take those some people also don't feel good when they take beta
alanine because it can give them this feeling of kind of like um itchy
creepy crawlies under the skin kind of the niacin phenomenon the
niacin flush some people don't mind that or some people don't
experience that so when it comes to supplementation there's a lot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;amp;t=7200"&gt;Synthesis; Next Episodes, Zero-Cost Ways to Support, Sponsors, Sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of variety but magnesium malate um has been shown to reduce soreness
so sometimes that's good cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness
things of that sort but in general we focused mainly today on
behavioral tools you'll notice that all of the tools are accessible
without the need for lots of equipment so i didn't say you need a
rower you need a kettlebell though those will work and i hope i was
able to illustrate for you that endurance isn't just one thing it's
not just the ability to go for long bouts of exercise of different
kinds that there's also this mental component because of the way that
neurons work and also that there are these different forms of
endurance of muscular endurance that where you're going to fail
because of the muscles and muscle energy utilization and the nerves
that innervate those muscles locally not because of a failure to bring
in oxygen or blood whereas long-duration effort it's going to be more
about you know being below your vo2 max and your ability to be
efficient for long bouts of more than 12 minutes of exercise one set
as they say of 12 minutes to maybe several hours i should just mention
with long duration type work you know you could even imagine raking in
the yard or mowing a lawn depending on how big that lawn is i used to
had a job when i was a kid mowing lawns and i'll tell you we didn't
have many neighbors with very big lawns but um there are a few of them
felt huge because they were really convoluted and if you're pushing
that mower and these were the old-fashioned mowers not electric mowers
it's work that's also of the sort that we call long-duration endurance
work high-intensity training will tap into yet other fuel sources and
mechanisms as we learned today so if you are enjoying this podcast and

it is patreon.com andrewhuberman at patreon.comhuberman you can
support the podcast at any level that you like please also check out
our sponsors that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast i know
ad reads are not the first thing that people want to hear when they're
getting ready to consume scientific information please understand that
the ads and the sponsors allow us to bring the zero cost to consumer
information about science and science related tools to everybody so if
you have the means check out the sponsors we only work with sponsors
whose products we really believe in and that i actually use and really
love there's no obligation however and we do talk about supplements
from time to time again no obligation to use supplements we also talk
about behavioral tools but if you are interested in supplements please
go to examine.com to evaluate those supplements and their various
effects if you're curious about that and we work with thorn t-h-o-r-
n-e thorn is a supplement manufacturer that we believe has the highest
levels of stringency in terms of the quality of the supplements and
they are very precise and very stringent about the amounts of each of
those compounds in the given supplements this is a huge problem
elsewhere in the supplement industry many brands don't include what
they say they include on the bottle it seems to show up every time
people test different brands but thorn continually tests out with the
highest levels of accuracy and stringency if you want to see the
supplements that i take you can go to thorne.com the letter u slash
huberman and if you do that you can see all the supplements that i
take you can get 20 off any of those supplements as well if you want
to navigate into the main thorn site and you see a supplement that
you're interested in you'll also get 20 off any of those supplements

&lt;p&gt;[Andrew Huberman] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss
science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that
theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first
sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition
platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better
understand your body and reach your health goals. I've long been a fan
of getting blood work done for the simple reason that many of the
things that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be
analyzed from a quality blood test. And now with the advent of modern
DNA tests, we can also get insight into things like metabolic factors
that tell us whether or not we metabolize caffeine well or certain
proteins well, what our fat metabolism genes are like. Things of that
sort can only be analyzed from quality blood and DNA tests. In
addition, many of the factors that impact our hormones, our metabolism
our brain health, those come back in a blood and DNA test and there
are many blood and DNA tests out there, but with InsideTracker, they
give you a lot of clear insight into what those markers mean and how
to adjust them. They have this terrific platform that doesn't just
give you the numbers back and tell you if you're higher or low in some
factor, but rather it tells you what your levels are of all those
factors and gives you very simple and clear directives of changes you
might make in your diet, changes that you might make in your exercise
regimen, or sleep, et cetera in order to get those markers where they
ought to be and where you would like them to be in order to optimize
yourself. So they make everything very easy, start to finish. They can
even come to your home to take the blood and DNA tests if you like. If
you'd like to try InsideTracker you can go to
insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get 25% off any
of InsideTracker's plans. Use the code Huberman at checkout. Today's
podcast is also brought to us by Belcampo Meat Company. Belcampo is a
regenerative farm in Northern California that raises organic grass fed
and finished certified humane meats. While I don't eat a lot of meat,
when I do I insist that that meat be a very high quality. How the
animals were cared for is extremely important to me and the life that
the animal had and what it consumed is very important to me. So the
way that I eat I've discussed on this podcast before but very briefly,
I basically fast until about noon, then I eat a piece of beef or
chicken with lunch and a salad. So that's basically my lunch. That's
what optimizes my levels of alertness for work throughout the day.
Then in the evening I shift over to eating primarily carbohydrates.
That's what allows me to sleep very well. So I'm not eating huge
volumes of meat but am eating meat every day. Conventionally raised
animals are confined to feed lots and need to diet of inflammatory
grains which is bad for them and it's bad for us when we eat their
meat. Belcampo animals graze on open pastures and seasonal grasses
resulting in meat that is higher in nutrients and healthy fats. And
I've talked before about the importance of omega-3 fatty acids for
both brain and body health and Belcampo meats are high in omega-3
fatty acids. The way Belcampo raises its animals isn't just better for
your health, it also has a positive impact on the environment. It's
what's called climate positive and carbon negative which means good
for the planet and good for us. My favorite meats from Belcampo are
the rib eye and the flank steaks. That's typically what I eat. I think
I probably eat about three or four of those across the week and then
I'll eat chicken on some other days. They're really delicious, and as
I mentioned, they're very good for us. You can order Belcampo
sustainably raised meats to be delivered straight to your door using
my code Huberman at belcampo.com/huberman. If you do that, you'll get
20% off first time order. That's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off
your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
Headspace is a meditation app backed by 25 published studies and has
over 600,000 five star reviews. So I've been meditating on and off
since I was about 15, 16 years old, mostly off at first. What I found
is that I'll sometimes start a meditation practice but it's very hard
to stay with. And then a few years ago I discovered Headspace and I
started meditating more regularly. In fact, very recently because I've
had an exorbitant amount of work on my plate and I've been getting
less sleep than I would like in order to complete that work, I've
brought back a regular meditation practice twice a day not just my
usual once a day. Headspace makes it really easy. They have so many
meditations on there and they guide you into the meditation and out of
the meditation in a way that just makes it very simple and makes
maintaining the practice really straightforward. Right now if you want
to try Headspace you can go to headspace.com/special offer. And if you
do that, you'll get a free one month trial. So that's totally free
with their full library of meditations for every situation. So there's
no meditations that you can't get access to with this offer. You can
get access to everything they've got. You just go to
headspace.com/special offer. You get a free one month trial and
hopefully you'll decide to stay with it. I've found that staying with
meditation has been immensely beneficial for all aspects of my life.
Today's episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast is our fourth and final
episode in this month which is all about skills and athletic
performance. Now, in a previous episode, we talked about science-based
in particular neuroscience-based tools for accelerating fat loss.
Previous to that, we talked about ways to improve skill learning,
motor movements which also included things like music and piano
playing not just athletic performance. And we've also been exploring
other aspects of physical performance throughout the entire month.
Today I want to talk about something that is vitally important for not
just athletic performance, but for your entire life and indeed for
your longevity, and that's muscle. Now, many of you, when you hear the
word muscle think muscle growth and building big muscles. And while we
will touch on muscle hypertrophy muscle growth today, and science-
based protocols to enhance hypertrophy, we will mainly be talking
about muscle as it relates to the nervous system. And I can't
emphasize this enough the whole reason why you have a brain is so that
you can move. And one of the things that's exquisite and fantastic
about the human brain, is that it can direct all sorts of different
kinds of movement, different speeds of movement, movement of different
durations. We can train our musculature to lift heavier and heavier
objects or we can train our musculature to take us further and further
so-called endurance. We can also build smoothness of movement, excuse
me, smoothness of movement as well as speed of movement, suppleness of
movement. All of that is governed by the relationship between the
nervous system, neurons and their connections to muscle. So when you
hear the science of muscle and muscle hypertrophy, you might think,
oh, well I'm not interested in building muscle but muscle does many
critical things. It's important for movement. It's important for
metabolism. The more muscle you have and not just muscle size but the
quality of muscle, that's a real thing, the higher your metabolism is,
and indeed the healthier you are. It turns out that jumping ability
and ability to stand up quickly and to get up off the floor quickly is
one of the most predictive markers of aging and biological aging and
no surprise that is governed by the brain to muscle connection. In
addition, muscle and musculature is vital for posture and we don't
talk about posture enough. We all have been told we need to sit up
straight or stand up straight, but posture is vitally important for
how the rest of our body works. It's vital to how we breathe. It's
actually even vital to how alert or sleepy we are. So we're going to
talk about the musculature for posture. We also are going to talk
about muscle as it relates to aesthetic things. Now, these are all
linked. Muscle for metabolism, movement, posture and aesthetics of
course are linked, right? As our posture changes, our aesthetic
changes. As our posture and aesthetic changes, how we move changes.
And as we improve muscle quality whether or not that's increasing
muscle size or not, that changes the way that our entire system not
just our nervous system and our muscular system but our immune system
and the other organs of the body work. So today, as always we're going
to talk a little bit of mechanism. I'm going to explain how neurons
control muscle and then we're going to look at muscle metabolism, how
muscle uses energy. I promise to make all of this very simple. I'm
actually going to keep it very brief probably about 10 minutes total.
And by the end of that 10 minutes, you will understand a lot about the
neuromuscular connection, how your brain and nervous system control
your muscle and how those muscles work. Then we are going to talk
about how muscles use energy and can change how they use energy for
sake of getting stronger, if you like for also increasing the size so-
called hypertrophy of muscle and for improving endurance as well as
for improving posture and how you move generally. We will touch on
some nutritional themes and how that relates to muscle in particular a
specific amino acid that if it's available in your bloodstream
frequently enough, and at sufficient levels, can help you build and
improve the quality of muscle. And we'll talk about specific exercise
regimes as well as of course, supplementation and things that can
enhance neuromuscular performance overall. We are also going to talk
about recovery. Recovery as everybody knows, is when things improve.
That's when neurons get better at controlling muscle, that's when
muscle grows, that's when muscle gets more flexible. None of that
actually happens during training. It happens after training and there
is a lot of confusion about how to optimize recovery and how to
measure whether or not you are recovered and ready to come back in for
another neuromuscular training session. So we'll talk about that as
well. Today is going to have a lot of protocols and you're going to
come away with a lot of understanding about how you move, how you work
in these incredible organs that we call the nervous system and the
musculature, the so-called neuromuscular system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=658"&gt;Protocol For Fat Loss: (Zero-Cost) PDF Available At: thecoldplunge.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into today's topic, I want to just take about three
minutes and cover some essential summary of the previous episode. In
the previous episode, we talked about fat loss. Talked about shiver
induced fat loss. We talked about neat non-exercise activity
thermogenesis for increasing caloric burn and fat oxidation. And we
talked about how to use cold specifically to enhance fat loss. I
described a protocol involving getting into cold of some sort, whether
or not it's ice bath, cold shower, some form of cold could even be a
river or an ocean if you have access to that and inducing shiver and
then getting out, not crossing your arms or huddling but allowing that
cold to evaporate off you and continuing to shiver and then getting
back into the colder environment of water or stream or shower, et
cetera. All of that is described in a beautifully illustrated protocol
that I didn't illustrate. That's why it's beautifully illustrated at
the coldplunge.com. They've made that protocol for you and they've
made it available free of charge for you. So there's no obligation
there of any kind financially. You can go to the coldplunge.com.
There's a little tab that says protocols and you can download that
protocol, someone there I don't know who exactly illustrated it, and
you can come away with a PDF of what I described in the previous
episode. So I just want to make sure that you are aware of that

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=765"&gt;Muscle Is A Slave To the Nervous System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people, when they hear the word muscle they just think about
strength. But of course muscles are involved in everything that we do.
They are involved in speaking, they're involved in sitting and
standing up, they're involved in lifting objects, including ourselves.
They are absolutely essential for maintaining how we breathe. They're
absolutely essential for ambulation, for moving, and for skills of any
kind. So when we think about muscle, we don't just want to think about
muscle the meat that is muscle, but what controls that muscle. And no
surprise what controls muscle is the nervous system. The nervous
system does that through three main nodes of control areas of control.
And I've talked about these before on a previous podcast. So I will
keep this very brief. Basically, we have upper motor neurons in our
motor cortex. So those are in our skull and those are involved in
deliberate movement. So if I decide that I'm going to pick my pen up
and put it down, which is what I'm doing right now, my upper motor
neurons were involved in generating that movement. Those upper motor
neurons send signals down to my spinal cord where there are two
categories of neurons. One are the lower motor neurons and those lower
motor neurons send little wires that we call axons out to our muscles
and cause those muscles to contract. They do that by dumping chemicals
onto the muscle. In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine. I've talked
before about acetylcholine in the brain which is vitally important for
focus and actually can gait neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to
change in response to experience. But in the neuromuscular system,
acetylcholine released from motor neurons is the way the only way that
muscles can contract. Now, there's another category of neurons in the
spinal cord called central pattern generators or CPGs. And those are
involved in rhythmic movements. Anytime we're walking or doing
something where we don't have to think about it to do it deliberately,
it's just happening reflexively that central pattern generators and
motor neurons. Anytime we're doing something deliberately, the top-
down control as we call it, from the upper motor neurons comes in and
takes control of that system. So it's really simple. You've only got
three ingredients. You've got the upper motor neurons, the lower motor
neurons and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive, you've also got
the central pattern generators. So it's a terrifically simple system
at that level, but what we're going to focus on today is how that
system can control muscle in ways that make that system better. Now,
when I say better, I want to be very specific. If your goal is to
build larger muscles, there's a way to use your nervous system to
trigger hypertrophy to increase the size of those muscles. And it is
indeed controlled by the nervous system. So you can forget the idea
that the muscles have memory or that muscles grow in response to
something that's just happening within the muscle, it's the nerve to
muscle connection that actually creates hypertrophy. I'll talk exactly
about how to optimize that process. In addition, if you want to
improve endurance or improve flexibility or suppleness or
explosiveness, that is all accomplished by the way that the nervous
system engages muscles specifically. And so what that means is we have
to ask ourselves are we going to take control of the upper motor
neurons, the central pattern generators, or the lower motor neurons or
all three in order to get to some end point of how the nervous system
controls muscle. So neurophysiology 101.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=982"&gt;Why We Have A Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give you one piece of history because it's important to know.
Sherrington, who won the Nobel prize called movement, the final common
path. Why did he say that? Well, the whole reason for having a nervous
system the whole reason for having a brain is so that we can control
our movements in very dedicated ways. That is one of the reasons,
perhaps the predominant reason why the human brain is so large. You
might think, oh it's so large for thinking and for creativity. Ah, no
when you look at the amount of real estate in the brain that's devoted
to different aspects of life, it's mainly vision, our ability to see
and movement, our ability to engage in lots of different kinds of
movements. Slow movements, fast movements, explosive, et cetera. Other
animals don't have that ability because they don't have the mental
real estate. They don't have the neural real estate in their brain.
They have neuromuscular junctions. They have central pattern
generators what they don't have are these incredible upper motor
neurons that can direct activity the muscles in very specific ways. So
we can all feel blessed that we have this system. And today I'm going
to teach you how to use that system toward particular end points. So
if we decide that we are going to direct our muscles in some
particular movement of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=1058"&gt;Flexors, Extensors, &amp;amp; Mutual Inhibition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not it's a weightlifting exercise, or whether it's a yoga
movement or simply picking up and putting down a pen, we are engaging
flexors and extensors and our body is covered with flexors and
extensors all over. So for instance, our bicep is a flexor and our
tricep is an extensor. Those are what are called antagonistic muscles.
They move the limbs in opposite directions. So if you bring your wrist
closer to your shoulder, that's flection using your bicep. If you move
your wrist further away from your shoulder, that's extension, using
your tricep. And without getting into a lot of detail the way that the
nerves and brain are wired up to muscle make it such that when a
flexor is activated, when the nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine onto
the muscle to activate the biceps, the triceps is inhibited. It's
prevented from engaging. There are ways to bypass this but that's the
typical mode of action. The converse is also true when our tricep is
in activated, when we move our wrist away from our shoulder our bicep
is inhibited. And we have flexors like our abdominal muscles. And we
have extensors in our lower back. Many of you probably know this but
some of you probably don't that your spine has flexors to move
basically your chin toward your waist. And it has, those are your
abdominal muscles among others. And you have extensors that move your
chin, basically back like looking up toward the ceiling. And those are
your extensors. You have other muscles that are stabilizing muscles
and things of that sort but those movements of flection and extension,
and the fact that they are what we call reciprocally innovated or
mutual inhibition, you hear different language around this is
characteristic of most of our limb movements. So hamstring and
quadriceps, the hamstring brings the ankle closer back towards the
glutes. Basically it's lifting your heel up which is almost always
done toward the back. Whereas your quadriceps is the extensor opposite
to the hamstrings. So you get the idea. So there's flexors and
extensors and it's the neurons that control those flexors and
extensors that allow us to move in particular ways. So, now you have
heard a neuromuscular physiology in its simplest form, but I do want
this to be accessible. I want to get just briefly, just briefly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=1200"&gt;How Muscles Move, Making &amp;amp; Using Muscle Energy: Making ATP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into some of the underlying metabolism of how muscles use and create
energy. Because in doing that, we will be in a great position to
understand all the tools that follow about how to optimize the
neuromuscular system for your particular goals. So in the previous
episode about fat loss, we talked about lipolysis. The breakdown of
fat into fatty acids so it can be used as fuel. And it ended in a step
where we got ATP, which is the bottleneck and final common path for
all energy producing functions in the body. There are other ways but
basically ATP is the key element there. Now with muscles, they don't
function on fats normally what they are going to function on their
ability to move and their ability to do things and allow us to move in
any way that we want to, is based on a process of glycolysis, the
breakdown of things like glycogen and glucose into energy. And it's a
very simple process. You don't have to know any chemistry. So if I say
the words carbon or hydrogen or something like that, don't freak out.
You don't have to understand any chemistry. But basically what happens
is you've got this available sugar resource that stored in muscle. And
that's glucose. And that glucose has six carbons and six waters,
basically. That can be broken down into two sets of three carbons. All
right. So basically you take glucose and you break it into these two
little batches of carbons that we call pyruvate. So six divided by two
is three. So you get three and three pyruvate. And that generates a
little bit of ATP of energy but just a little bit. Now, if there's
oxygen available, if there's sufficient oxygen there, what can happen
is that pyruvate can be brought to the mitochondria and through a
whole set of things that you probably don't want to hear about right
now like the electron transport chain and citric acid cycle. What
happens is it's broken down and you get 28 to 30 ATP, which has a lot
of ATP. So the only things you need to know, the only things you need
to know about this process is that glucose and glycogen are broken
down into pyruvate. You a little bit of energy from that. And when I
say energy, I mean the ability to move. It's fuel, literally just gets
burned up. But if there's oxygen available and that's key then within
the mitochondria, you can create 28 to 30 ATP which is a lot of ATP.
Now, what does this mean? This means that movement of muscle is
metabolically expensive and indeed compared to other tissues compared
to fat, compared to bone, compared to almost all other tissues, except
brain tissue muscle is the most metabolically demanding which is why
people who have more muscle relative to adipose tissue to fat, they
can eat more and they're more of a furnace. They just kind of burn
that up. So even if you didn't understand anything that I just said,
what you probably did hear, and that I hope you heard is that if you
have oxygen around, you can create energy from this fuel source that
we call glycogen and glucose. But what if there isn't oxygen around?
And what is that like? Well, you've experienced that. I'm not talking
about oxygen in the environment. I'm talking about oxygen in the
muscle. So if you've ever carried a box while moving,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=1409"&gt;The “Burn” Is Not Lactic Acid. Lactate: A Buffer (Prevents Acidity), Fuel, &amp;amp; Hormone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or you're carrying heavy groceries to the car, or you're exercising
particularly hard and you felt the burn, well, that burning which most
people think is lactic acid is actually a process by which pyruvate,
which as I said before normally could be converted into ATP if there's
oxygen, well, if there's not enough oxygen 'cause that muscle is
working too hard or too long, what ends up happening is that a
hydrogen molecule comes in there and you get something called lactate.
So believe it or not, humans don't make lactic acid. That's another
species, we make lactate. And we hear that lactate is bad. We need to
buffer the burn or avoid the burn. That lactic acid and lactate are
what prevent us for performing as well as we ought to be able to or
going as far as we possibly could in an endurance event. Guess what,
that's not true at all. Lactate has three functions, all of which are
really interesting and really important. First of all, it's a buffer
against acidity. You don't want muscle to get too acidic because it
can't function. You don't want any body tissue to get too acidic. So
that burn that you feel is acidity in that environment and lactate
what most people call lactic acid, but again, we don't make lactic
acid. Lactate is there to buffer that to reduce the amount of burn.
So, most people have this exactly backwards. So when you feel that
burn that is not lactic acid, that is lactate that's present to
suppress the burn, to suppress acidity. It's also a fuel. When you
feel that burn, lactate is shuttled to those areas of the muscle, and
there's an actual fuel burning process where in the absence of oxygen
you can continue to generate muscular contractions. Now, this is
informative 'cause it also tells us that that burning that acidity
that we feel can inhibit the way that our muscles work but that
lactate comes in and allows our muscles to continue to function. So
we'll talk a little bit more about what this whole lactate thing and
the burn means but it's a really important process. And it's amazing
to me that most people understand it in exactly the incorrect way.
They think a lactic acid is bad and the burn is bad. No, it reveals a
number of really important things are going on with this vital
molecule lactate, which can reduce acidity, reduce the burn as well as
act as a fuel. Now, here's where it gets really, really cool. And if
you don't have enough of an incentive to exercise based on all the
information out there about how it'll make you live longer and make
your heart better, et cetera, here's a reason that regardless of what
kind of exercise you do, if it's weight training, or running, or
cycling, or swimming that every once in a while, about 10% of the time
you should exercise to the point of intensity where you start to feel
that so-called burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=1571"&gt;Feeling the Burn For 10% of Workouts Is Good For Brain, Heart, Liver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for that is that lactate shows up to the site of the burn,
so to speak, and it acts as a hormonal signal for other organs of the
body in a very positive way. As you may recall, from a very early
episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, I talked about what a hormone is
and how it works. We have lots of different kinds of hormones but
hormones are chemicals that are released in one location in the body
and travel, have effects on lots of other organs of the body. So when
I say that lactate acts as a hormonal signal, what I mean is that it's
in a position to influence tissues that are outside of the muscle. And
basically it can send signals to the heart, to the liver and to the
brain, and it can have effects on the heart, the liver and the brain
that are very positive. So just to zoom out for a second I promise we
won't get any more technical than this. We will get into tools and
protocols that are really straightforward but what I'm telling you is
that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=1650"&gt;Leveraging Lactate To Enhance Brain Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you feel a burn from a particular exercise or movement, that burn
is going to be buffered by this molecule we call lactate. Lactate will
then provide additional fuel for additional work. So this is a good
incentive provided you can do it safely to "Work through the burn."
That burn acts as a beacon to the lactate which comes in and allows
you to do more work. It's not a signal to stop necessarily. I mean,
stop if you're doing something unsafe but it's a signal that lactate
should come in and allow you to continue to do work. And it can act as
a hormonal signal. Lactate can then travel to the heart and to the
liver and to the brain and can enhance their function in positive
ways, not just in those moments, but in the period of time that
follows. So many people are curious about how they can exercise to
make their brain better. That's one of the most common questions I
get. What I'm telling you is that provided you can do it safely by
engaging the so-called burn which is at a different threshold for
everybody, your hill run will be different than my hill run to
generate the burn, but provided you can do that for about 10% of your
workouts or of an individual workout, or activity of any kind, you are
generating the activity of this lactate based hormonal signal that can
improve the function of neurons. And it does that if you want to know
for the aficionados by improving the function of another cell type
called the astrocytes which are a glial cell type. Which are very
involved in clearance of debris from the brain, they're involved in
the formation of synopsis connections between neurons in the brain. So
put simply, if you are an exerciser if you're doing movement of any
kind, and you're interested in allocating some of that movement toward
enhancing brain, heart and liver health, there is a nice set of
scientific data that points to the fact that getting a lactate
shuttled to the muscles by engaging this burning sensation is
advantageous for the health of those other tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=1780"&gt;Breathing Properly Through “The Burn”— For Sake of Performance &amp;amp; Brain Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I mentioned that burn is present from lack of oxygen being
present. And then the hydrogen comes in and you get this lactate. But
this process of lactate acting as a buffer of fuel and a positive
hormonal signal for other tissues, occurs only if there's oxygen. So
if you feel the burn, you definitely want to focus on your breathing
at that point. That would be the time to take deep inhales and try and
bring more oxygen into your system. It's definitely not a time to hold
your breath. And if ever you've run to the point of feeling the burn
and then you were exercised in any way on the treadmill or on the bike
or whatever, and felt that burn, and then you held your breath, it
feels much more intense. By breathing you bring lactate to the site
and you are able to allow lactate to act more as a buffer, a fuel, and
a hormonal signal. And the reason I brought this up today is because
as I mentioned so many people are interested in using exercise not
just for sake of improving physical health and wellbeing and
performance, but also for enhancing their brain. And there are a lot
of data out there speaking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=1847"&gt;Neurogenesis (New Neurons) &amp;amp; Exercise: Not Much, In Humans… Which Is Good.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to the findings that exercise of various kinds can increase
neurogenesis, the creation of new neurons. Well, the unfortunate news
is that while that's true in mice, there is very little evidence for
enhanced neurogenesis from exercise or otherwise in humans. There's a
little bit, and there are a few sites within the brain, such as the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, which may be involved in the
formation of new memories, to be clear the dentate gyrus is definitely
involved in the formation of new memories, whether or not the new
neurons that are added there in humans are involved in new memories.
The evidence for that is weak at best, frankly whereas an animals the
data are quite strong, but most of the data points to the fact that
hormonal signals, things that are transported in the blood during
exercise are beneficial for the brain and that those signals are not
causing the increase in the number of neurons in the dentate gyrus or
otherwise. That it's more about the health of the connections between
the neurons growth factors of various kinds things like IGF-1, there's
a long list of these things. So if you've heard the exercise increases
the number of neurons in your brain, well, that's not true. And that
probably is a good thing, frankly because we always hear more neurons,
more neurons as if it's a good thing, but the brain doesn't do so well
with bringing in entirely new elements. It has a hard time negotiating
that and making use of those new elements. We know about this from
things like the cochlear implant where deaf people are given a device
where they suddenly can hear. Some people really like that, deaf
people really like that and can benefit from it. Other deaf people
find that it's very intrusive. That is hard to take an existing neural
circuit in the brain and incorporate a lot of new information into it.
So new neurons, as great as that sounds more neurons, more neurons, it
actually might not be the best way for the nervous system to change
and modify itself and to promote its own longevity. So when I tell you
not such great evidence from new neurons past puberty, that's what the
data really show in humans. And I sort of knocked back the data on
exercise and neurogenesis, don't let that depress you. If you have
dementia in your family, don't translate that into necessarily that
you will develop dementia. Understand the exercise is still beneficial
for the brain and other aspects of the nervous system but that it's
going to be doing it through these hormonal signals. Things like
IGF-1, things like this lactate pathway when you experience the burn
from exercise. And again, you don't want to try and get this feeling
of a burn throughout the entire episode of exercise, there'll be far
too intense and would inhibit your recovery. I don't think it'd be
good for performance either. It's only about 10% of your total effort
in any one exercise about that's going to give you this positive
effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=2019"&gt;How To Contract Muscles, Make Them Bigger and/or Stronger: Henneman’s Principle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you know how to devote a small portion of your exercise, 10% in
order for muscle and lactate to benefit other tissues namely your
heart, your liver, and your brain. I'd now like to shift our attention
to how to use specific aspects of muscular contraction to improve
muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth, as well as improving muscle
strength. There are a lot of reasons to want to get stronger. And I
should just mention that it's not always the case that getting
stronger involves muscles getting bigger. There are ways for muscles
to get stronger without getting bigger. However, increasing the size
of a muscle almost inevitably increases the strength of that muscle at
least to some degree. Reasons why most everyone should want to get
their muscles stronger is that muscles are generally getting
progressively weaker across the lifespan. So when I say getting
stronger, it's not necessarily about being able to move increasing
mounts of weight in the gym. Although if that's your goal what I'm
about to discuss will be relevant to that, but rather to offset some
of the normal decline in strength and posture and the ability to
generate a large range of movement safely, that occurs as we age. As I
mentioned at the beginning of the episode we just tend to lose
function in this neuromuscular system as we get older. And doing
things to offset that has been shown again and again, to be beneficial
for the neuromuscular system for protection of injury, for enhancing
the strength of bones and bone density. So there are a lot of reasons
to use resistance exercise that extend far beyond just the desire to
increase muscle size because I know many of you are interested in
increasing muscle size, but many of you are not. So there's an
important principle of muscle physiology called the Henneman size
principle. And the Henneman size principle essentially says that we
recruit what are called motor units. Motor units are just the
connections between nerve and muscle from in a pattern that staircases
from low threshold to high threshold. What this means is when you pick
up something that is light, you're going to use the minimum amount of
nerve to muscle energy in order to move that thing. Likewise, when you
pick up an object that's heavy, you're going to use the minimum amount
of nerve to muscle connectivity and energy in order to move that
object. So it's basically a conservation of energy principle. Now, if
you continue to exert effort of movement, what will happen is you will
tend to recruit more and more motor units with time. And that process
of recruiting more neurons, more lower motor neurons if you recall
from the beginning of the episode, these lower motor neurons are in
our spinal cord and they actually dump a chemical acetylcholine on
muscle, caused the muscles to contract. As you recruit more and more
of these motor units, these connections between these lower motor
neurons and muscle, that's when you start to get changes in the
muscle. That's when you open the gate for the potential for the
muscles to get stronger and to get larger, if that's what your goal
is. And so the way this process works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=2218"&gt;A Large Range of Weight (30-80% of One Repetition Maximum) Can Be Used&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has been badly misunderstood in the kind of online literature of
weight training and bodybuilding, and even in sports physiology. The
Henneman size principle is kind of a foundational principle within
muscle physiology but many people have come to interpret it by saying
that the way to recruit high threshold motor units, the ones that are
hard to get to is to just use heavy weights. And that's actually not
the case as we'll talk about the research supports that weights in a
very large range of sort of a percentage of your maximum, anywhere
from 30% to 80%. So weights that are not very light but are moderately
light, too heavy can cause changes in the connections between nerve
and muscle that lead to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy. Put
differently, heavyweights can help build muscle and strength but they
are not required. What one has to do is adhere to a certain number of
parameters, just a couple of key variables that I'll spell out for
you. And if you do that, you can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy,
muscle size and or muscle strength if that's what you want to do. And
you don't necessarily have to use heavy weights in order to do that.
Now, I'm sure the power lifters and the people that like to move heavy
weights around will say, no, if you want to get strong you absolutely
have to lift heavy weights. And that might be true if you want to get
very strong but for most people who are interested in supporting their
muscular such that they offset any age related decline in strength, or
in increasing hypertrophy and strength to some degree, there really
isn't a need to lie about the Henneman size principle which many
people out there are doing and claiming that you absolutely need to
use the heaviest weights possible in order to build strength and
muscle. So I'm going to explain all of this works in simple terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=2338"&gt;What Makes Muscles To Grow? Stress, Tension, &amp;amp; Damage; Myosin Balloons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first of all, let's just talk about what hypertrophy is and what
strength changes in the muscle are. We can make this very simple as
well. If this were a muscle physiology class we would talk all about
myofibrils and sarcomeres and all that stuff. We're not going to do
that. That's not the purpose of today's conversation. If you're
interested in that as well as a lot of the other information that I'm
going to discuss in more detail, I highly encourage you to check out
the YouTube channel and the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin. He's a PhD
and a full professor in exercise physiology. He's extremely
knowledgeable in this entire area of science-based tools for
hypertrophy, how strength and hypertrophy really work. His lab does
everything from biopsy on muscles, working with athletes and typical
folks as well. A lot of the information that you're going to hear from
me in the next 15 minutes or so comes from an extensive exploration of
the work that he and his colleagues have done as well as folks like
Brad Schoenfeld, another academic who's suburb in this whole space of
muscle physiology and from a lengthy conversation that I had with
Andy, Dr. Galpin prior to this episode. So if we want to think about
muscle hypertrophy, we have to ask what is changing when muscles get
larger or stronger. And there are really just three ways that muscles
can be stimulated to change. So let's review those three ways and talk
about what happens inside the muscle. So there are three major
stimulate for changing the way that muscle works and making muscles
stronger, larger, or better in some way. And those are stress,
tension, and damage. Those three things don't necessarily all have to
be present but stress of some kind has to exist. Something has to be
different in the way that the nerve communicates with the muscle and
the way that the muscle contracts or performs that makes the muscle
need to change. So this is very reminiscent of neuroplasticity in the
brain. Something needs to happen. Certain chemicals need to be
present. Certain processes need to happen or else a tissue simply
won't change itself. But if those processes and events do happen, then
the tissue has essentially no option except, but to change. So muscles
move, as I mentioned because nerves dump chemical onto the muscles but
they move because they have these things called myosin and actin
filaments. And if you want to read up on this, you can look on the
internet you can put the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction
if you really want to go deep down that rabbit hole. It's interesting.
You can learn about this in a muscle physiology class. But basically,
along the length of the muscle you have, what's called myosin. And
just think of myosin as kind of like a wire. It's like a bunch of
beads and wires that extend across the muscle. I think that's the
simplest way to describe it. And the myosin is surrounded by these
little beads called actin. The way muscles get bigger is that
basically the myosin gets thicker. It's a protein and it gets thicker.
So put this in your mind if you're listening to this or even if you're
watching it on YouTube, the way to think about this whole actin myosin
thing and thing and muscles getting bigger is imagine that you're
holding a bouquet of balloons, a bunch of balloons by their strings
except you're not holding the strings all at their bottom. So the
bouquet isn't nicely arranged. It's not like some balloons that are
all up at the top and you're holding the strings down at the bottom.
Imagine that one of the balloons that is very close to your hand and
other one is a little bit higher up. And so this bouquet is very
disorganized. In other words, the string extending out of your hand
the strings rather extending out of your hand are all different
lengths. And so the balloons are all over the place. That's
essentially what myosin looks like in the muscle. And those strings
are what we call the filaments, and then the myosin head is the
balloon. When you stress a muscle properly, or you give it sufficient
tension, or you damage the muscle just enough, there's an adaptive
response that takes place where protein is synthesized. And it's a
very specific protein, it's myosin. The myosin gets thicker. In other
words, the balloons get bigger. So the way to think about muscle
growth and the way to think about muscles getting stronger is that
those balloons get bigger and the muscle gets thicker. Now, the
question then should be as always how does that happen? I mean, the
muscle doesn't really know anything about what's happening in the
outside world. The way it happens is the nerve, the neuron has to tell
the muscle to get stronger. And it does that through what we call a
signaling cascade. It talks to the muscle in terms of chemicals. It
doesn't whisper to it or shout or Hey, get bigger. What it does it
release a certain chemicals that within the muscle, there are certain
chemicals released rather that make those balloons as I'm referring to
them, the myosin get thicker. So let's talk about the stimulus for
doing that. And if already in your mind, you're imagining oh my
goodness, these balloons of muscle are going to get thick, thick,
thick, thick, thick, and it's just going to spiral out of control,
don't worry about that. People invest a ton of time and energy into
trying to make their muscles larger. It's actually much harder for
people to do than you might think. But I do want to give one exception
because it illustrates an important principle of where we're headed
next. Everybody has imbalances in how muscles can grow. How well
muscles can grow, or how poorly, or how challenging it is for their
muscles to grow. Now, many people who are afraid of like getting too
bulky for instance, are afraid of lifting weights. But I think the
research shows now that every one of pretty much every age should be
doing some sort of resistance exercise even if that's body weight
exercises in order to offset this age-related decline in muscle
contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone density.
There's nothing good about getting frail and weak over time. And
people who invest the effort into doing resistance exercises of some
kind whether or not it's with bands or with weights or with body
weight, really benefit tremendously at a whole body level at a
systemic level as well as in terms of muscle strength. There is a good
predictor of how well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=2722"&gt;Figuring Out Which of Your Muscles Will Grow &amp;amp; Get Stronger Easily (Or Not)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or how efficient you will be in building the strength and or if you
like the size of a given muscle. And it has everything to do with
those upper motor neurons that are involved in deliberate control of
muscle. You can actually do this test right now. You can just kind of
March across your body mentally and see whether or not you can
independently contract any or all of your muscles. So for instance, if
you are sitting in a chair or a you're standing, see whether or not
you can contract your calf muscle just using those upper motor neuron,
sending a signal down and deliberately isolating the calf muscle. If
you can contract the calf muscle hard to the point where that muscle
almost feels like it's starting to cramp like it hurts just a little
bit, that can be extremely painful nor is it going to have no
sensation whatsoever, chances are you have very good upper motor
neuron to calf control. And chances are, if you can isolate that what
they call the brain or mind muscle connection, and you can contract
the muscles to the point where it cramps a little bit, that you hold a
decent to high potential to change the strength and the size of that
muscle if you train it properly. Now, if you have a hard time doing
that, chances are you won't be able to do that. If for instance, you
focus on your back muscle. Like we all have these muscles called the
lat. The latissimus dorsi muscles, which basically are involved in
chin ups and things like that, but their function from a more of a
kinesiology standpoint is to move the elbow back behind the body. So
it's not about flexing your bicep. It's about moving your elbow back
behind your body. If you can do that, mentally or you can do that
physical movement of moving your elbow back behind your body and you
can contract that muscle hard, chances are that you have the capacity
to enhance the strength and or size of that particular muscle because
you have the neural control of that muscle. This is a key feature of
the neuromuscular system to appreciate as we begin to talk more about
specific protocols. Because everything about muscle hypertrophy, about
stimulating muscle growth is about generating isolated contractions
about challenging specific muscles in a very unnatural way. Whereas
with strength, it's about using musculature as a system moving
weights, moving resistance, moving the body. The specific goal of
hypertrophy is to isolate specific nerve to muscle pathways so that
you stimulate the chemical and signaling transduction events in muscle
so that those muscles respond by getting larger. So there's a critical
distinction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=2891"&gt;Getting Stronger Versus Muscle Growth: Distributed Versus Local Effort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in terms of getting stronger versus trying to get muscles to be larger
hypertrophy per se. And it has to do with how much you isolate those
muscles. Muscle isolation is not a natural phenomenon. It's not
something that we normally do. When we walk we don't think, okay,
right calf contract, left calf contract. No, you just generate those
rhythmic movements. And of course, there's no reason for them to get
stronger or larger in response to those movements. Let's say you were
to do a kind of strange experiment of attaching 30 pound weights to
your ankles. And you were to do those movements. Well, if you weren't
specifically contracting your calves in each step, there's no reason
for the calves to take on the bulk of the work. And you would
distribute that work across your hip flexors and other aspects of your
musculature. Your whole nervous system seeks to gain efficiency. It
seeks to spread out the effort. So you can nest this as a principle
for yourself which is if you want to get stronger it's really about
moving progressively greater loads or increasing the amount of weight
that you move. Whereas if you're specifically interested in generating
hypertrophy, it's all about trying to generate those really hard,
almost painful localized contractions of muscle. Now, of course, how
much weight you use in order to generate those contractions will also
impact hypertrophy. But I think most people don't really understand
the mind muscle connection. It sounds like a great thing, but it's
actually one of the things you want to avoid if your goal is simply to
become more supple or to become stronger. You want to do the movements
properly and safely, of course but it's the opposite of hypertrophy
where with hypertrophy you're really trying to make that particular
muscle sometimes two muscles do the majority, if not all the work
whereas in moving force loads in trying to generate activity of any
kind like lifting a bar, doing a chin up or something those so-called
compound movements involve a lot of muscle groups. If your goal is to
be better at those, you want to avoid isolating any one particular
muscle. Now, I know this probably comes across as a kind of obvious
duh, especially to the folks who have spent a lot of time in the gym
aimed at getting hypertrophy. But I think most people don't appreciate
that it's the nerve to muscle connections and the distinction between
isolating nerve to muscle connections versus distributing the work of
nerve to muscle connections, that's vital in determining whether or
not you generate hypertrophy isolated nerve to muscle contractions
versus strength and offsetting strength loss which would be
distributed nerve to muscle connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=3047"&gt;How Much Resistance Should (Most) People Use? (30-80% Range) &amp;amp; Specific Goal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ever there was an area of practical science that was very confused,
very controversial, and almost combative at times, it would be this
issue of how best to train. I suppose the only thing that's even more
barbed wire of a conversation than that is how best to eat for health.
Those seem to be the two most common areas of online battle and the
scientific literature has a lot to say about both of those things.
Again, my sources for what I'm about to tell you are Professor Andy
Galpin and colleagues. I know there are other excellent people out
there in the field, but I really trust his work. He does very
controlled studies. He spent a lot of time in this space and what's
really exciting is that in just the last three years or so, there's
been a tremendous amount of information to come out about the
practical steps that one can take in order to maximize the benefits of
resistance exercise of any kind. So I'm going to talk about those and
I'm going to talk about the research. I will provide some links, a
couple of the more in-depth tutorials from Dr. Galpin, as well as some
of the papers that the information I'm about to tell you stems from.
There's a lot of information saying that you need to move weights that
are 80 to 90% of your one rep maximum or 70%, or cycle that for three
weeks on and then go to more moderate weights. There are a lot of
paths as some people say there are a lot of ways to add up numbers to
get a 100. There's a near infinite number of ways to add up different
numbers to get to a 100. And what's very clear now from all the
literature that's transpired and especially from the literature in
this last three years, is that once you know roughly your one
repetition maximum, the maximum amount of weight that you can perform
an exercise with for one repetition in good form, full range of
motion, that it's very clear that moving weights or using bands or
using body weight, for instance in the 30% to 80% of one-rep maximum.
That is going to be the most beneficial range in terms of muscle
hypertrophy and strength. So muscle growth and strength. And there
will be a bias if you're moving weights that are in the 75%, 80% range
or maybe even going above that 85 and 90%, you're going to bias your
improvements towards strength gains. This is true. And if you use
weights that are in the 30% of your one-repetition maximum or 40% or
50% and doing many more repetitions, of course, then you are biasing
towards hypertrophy and what some people like to call muscle
endurance. But that's a little bit of a complicated term because
endurance, we almost always think of as relating to running or
swimming or some long bouts of activity. So 30% to 80% of one-
repetition maximums, it doesn't really seem to matter for sake of
hypertrophy, except at the far ends when you're really trying to bias
for strength. Now, it is clear, however that one needs to perform
those sets to failure where you can't perform another repetition in
good form again or near to failure. And there's all sorts of
interesting nomenclature that's popping up all over the internet. Some
of which is scientific, some of which is not scientific about how you
are supposed to perceive how close you were to failure, et cetera. But
there are some very interesting principles that relate to how the
nerves connect to the muscles that strongly predict whether or not
this exercise that you're performing will be beneficial for you or
not. So here's how it goes. For individuals that are untrained&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=3265"&gt;How Many Sets Per Week To Maintain Or To Grow Muscle &amp;amp; Get Stronger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meaning they have been doing resistance exercise for anywhere from
zero, probably out to about two years, although for some people, it
might be zero to one year, but those are the so-called beginners.
They're sort of untrained. For those people, the key parameter seems
to be to perform enough sets of a given exercise per muscle per week.
The same is also true for people that have been training for one or
two years or more. What differs is how many sets to perform depending
on whether or not you're trained or untrained. So let's say you're
somebody who's been doing some resistance exercise kind of on and off
over the years and you decide you want to get serious about that for
sake of sport or offsetting age related declines in strength, the
range of sets to do in order to improve strength to activate these
cascades in the muscle ranges anywhere from two, believe it or not to
20 per week. Again, these are sets per week and they don't necessarily
all have to be performed in the same weight training session. I will
talk about numbers of sessions. So it appears that five sets per week
in this 30% to 80% of the one repetition maximum range, getting close
to failure, or occasionally actually going to full muscular failure,
which isn't really full muscular failure, but the inability to
generate a contraction of the muscle or move the weight in good form.
I'll go deeper into that in a moment. But about five sets per week is
what's required just to maintain your muscle. So think about that. If
you're somebody who's kind of averse to resistance training, you are
going to lose muscle size and strength. Your metabolism will drop.
Your posture will get worse. Everything in the context of nerve to
muscle conductivity will get worse over time, unless you are
generating five sets or more of this 30% to 80% of your one repetition
maximum per week. So what this means is for the typical person who
hasn't done a lot of weight training, you need to do at least five
sets per muscle group. Now, that's just to maintain. And then there's
this huge range that goes all the way up to 15 and in some case, 20
sets per week. Now, how many sets you perform is going to depend on
the intensity of the work that you perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=3403"&gt;10% Of Resistance Training Should Be To “Failure”, the Rest Should End “Near” Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where it gets a little bit controversial but I think nowadays
most people agree and Dr. Galpin confirmed that 10% not to be confused
with the 10% we discussed earlier, but 10% of the sets of a given
workout or 10% of workouts overall should be of the high-intensity
sort where one is actually working to muscular failure. Now I say not
true muscular failure because in theory you have a concentric movement
which is the kind of lifting of the weight, and then you have the
ecentric portion of muscle contraction, which is the lowering. And
ecentric movements because of the way that muscle fibers lengthen and
that sliding act myosin that we talked about before, you're always
stronger in lowering something than you are in lifting it. But the
point being that most of your training most of your sets should be not
to failure. And the reason for that is it allows you to do more volume
of work without fatiguing the nervous system and depleting the nerve
to muscle connection in ways that are detrimental. So we can make this
simple. Perform anywhere from 5 to 15 sets of resistance exercise per
week, and that's per muscle, and that's in this 30% to 80% of what
your one-repetition maximum. That seems to be the most scientifically
supported way of offsetting any decline in muscle strength if you're
working in the kind of five set range and in increasing muscle
strength when you start to get up into the 10 and 15 set range. Now,
the caveat to that is everyone varies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=3503"&gt;Number of Sets: Inversely Related To the Ability to Generate High Force Contractions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and muscles vary in terms of their recover ability. Depending on how
well you can control the contraction of muscles deliberately. And you
can actually figure that out by sort of marching, you might take five
minutes and just kind of March across your body and mentally try and
control the contractions of muscles in a very deliberate way to the
point where you can generate a hard contraction. And you may have to
move a limb in order to do this, by the way. I'm not talking about
just mentally contracting your bicep without moving your wrist. I'm
talking about doing that without any weight in hand or any band or any
resistance. If you can generate a high intensity contraction using
these upper motor neuron to lower motor neuron pathways to muscle, you
might think, well I should perform many more sets. But actually, the
opposite is true. If you can generate high-intensity muscular
contractions using your brain, using your neurons, it will take fewer
sets in order to stimulate the muscle to maintain itself and to
stimulate the muscle in order to grow or get stronger. So the more
efficient you are in recruiting motor units, remember, Henneman's size
principle the recruit men have more motor units which isn't just
muscles, it's nerve to muscle connections. The better you are at doing
that, the more you will recruit these so-called high threshold motor
units the ones that are hard to get to, the more you will kick off the
cascades of things within muscle that stimulate muscle growth and
strength. So if you have muscles that are challenging to contract,
it's going to take more sets in order to stimulate the desired effect
in those muscles not fewer. If you have muscles that you are very good
at generating force within, it's going to take fewer sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=3609"&gt;How Long Should Weight Training Sessions Last&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how many sets you are going to have to determine that it's going
to depend for those of you that are using like 50% of your one-
repetition maximum, because you're doing a lot of repetitions, you
might find that three or four, five sets will maintain the muscle. You
might decide to do that once at one point in the week and then do it
again. So if you're going for 10 sets a week you can divide that among
two sessions. You could do that all in one session. The data really
show it doesn't matter. There are some differences in terms of whether
or not you're trying to generate maximum intensity within a workout or
whether or not you want to spread that out. But in general, resistance
workouts of any kind tend to be best favored by workouts that are
somewhere between 45 minutes and 60 minutes. And generally not longer
than 60 minutes because that's when all the things like cortisol and
some of the inflammatory pathways really start to create a situation
in the muscle and in the body that's not so great for you. So it's not
a hard and fast rule. The ax doesn't drop at 60 minutes but it's
pretty clear that performing this five to 15 sets per week, whether or
not it's in one workout or whether that's divided up across multiple
workouts is really what's going to be most beneficial. And please do
keep in mind Henneman's size principle and the recruitment of motor
units. And remember the better you are at contracting particular
muscles in an isolating those muscles, the fewer sets likely you need
to do in order to get the desired effect. Now, what about people who
have been training for a while?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=3695"&gt;Training Duration &amp;amp; Volume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're somebody who's been doing weight training for a while, the
data points to the fact that more volume can be beneficial, even for
muscles that you are very efficient at contracting. Now, the curve on
this, the graph on this begins again at about five sets per week for
maintaining a given muscle group, and extends all the way out to 25 or
30 sets per week. However, there are individuals who for whatever
reason can generate so much force. They're so good at training muscles
that they can generate so much force in just four or six or eight sets
that doing this large volume of work is actually going to be
counterproductive. So everyone needs to figure out for themselves.
First of all, how often you're willing to do resistance exercise of
any kind. And again, it doesn't matter if you're using bands or
weights or body weight. For instance, if you're doing chin-ups chances
are unless you are very strong that you're not using weights. You're
just using something that you can hold onto. Or if you're doing
pushups, some of you will be working in that 30% to 80% of your one-
repetition maximum range. It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to
be moving weights in a gym for instance. So the purpose here is to
figure out what muscles you're trying to train. That's an issue that
we'll talk about in a moment. And then it does appear that somewhere
between five and 15 sets per week is going to be the thing that's
going to work for most people. Now, this is based on a tremendous
amount of work that was done by Andy Galpin and colleagues, Brad
Schoenfeld and colleagues and others, Mike Roberts. There's a huge
group of people out there doing exercise physiology and a small subset
of them that are linking them back to real-world protocols that don't
just pertain to athletes. So that's mainly what I'm focusing on today.
And surely there will be exceptions. Now, if you are going to divide
the sets across the week you're not going to do all 10 sets for
instance for a given muscle group in one session, then of course, it's
imperative that the muscles recover in between sessions. And we are
going to talk about recovery both at the systemic level, the whole
nervous system and at the local level the nerve to muscle and local
even muscle level. We'll talk about that in about 10 minutes when we
talk about recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=3831"&gt;Range of Motion &amp;amp; Speed of Movement; The Key Role of (Upper Motor) Neurons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to mention something very important which is that everything
I'm referring to here it has to do with full range of motion. And you
might ask, well, what about the speeds of movements? This is actually
turns out to be a really interesting dataset for generating
explosiveness and speed. So for sprinters or throwing sports, or for
people that want to generate a lot of jumping power, it does appear
that learning to move weights as fast as you safely can, especially
under moderate to heavy loads, can increase explosiveness and speed.
And most of that effect is from changes in the neurons. It's not from
changes in the muscle. It's from changes in the way that the upper
motor neurons communicate with the lower motor neurons and generating
a pathway, a neural circuit, as we call it, that is very efficient at
generating action potentials, which are the electricity within neurons
to trigger the muscle. Now, of course there are events that happen
from nerve to muscle but the takeaway from that enormous literature,
frankly is that if you want to get faster, yes, it can be beneficial
to get stronger. But if you want to dedicate resistance training
specifically to jumping higher, to running faster, to throwing further
and these sorts of things that learning to generate force with
increasing speed is going to be beneficial. On the flip side of that
for people that want to get stronger, it appears that the slowing down
of the weight as things get harder is a key parameter in recruiting
those high threshold motor units. So let me phrase that a little bit
differently. Think about a set in the gym or think about a set of
pushups or a set of pull-ups. Initially you can move very fast if you
like. If you want to generate hypertrophy, the goal really is not
necessarily to move super slow but to isolate the muscle and therefore
not to use momentum rather than lift weights, as they say, challenge
muscles. If you want to get stronger, you're going to be distributing
that effort over more muscles and more of your nervous system. For
generating explosiveness and speed, it's very clear that learning to
generate forces quickly and to move heavy or moderately heavy loads
quickly is going to be beneficial because of the way that you train
the motor neurons. And of course changes in the muscle. But this could
look different for different sports. And obviously you want to make
safety paramount. If you're injured, you're not going to be able to
train at all for sport or for any purpose that is. And so what this
would involve is something like 60% to 75% of a one-repetition
maximum, and then in a controlled way moving that as quickly as one
can throughout the entire set. And certainly not going to failure
because as you approach failure, the inability to move the weight with
good form, the weight inevitably slows down. In fact, there are a lot
of new technologies now that are focused on informing people of how
quickly the bar or weight is moving. I saw an advertisement for this
the other day. There are things that people can attach to bars that
will literally speak to you as you're doing a set and inform you
whether or not you're moving four times more slowly per rep than you
were at the beginning. And trying to hone in on the exact speed of
movement. In talking to these experts prior to this episode it does
appear that for sake of hypertrophy, as long as you're not moving the
muscle so quickly that you start to distribute the effort to lots of
other muscles, it doesn't really matter because as the set gets
harder, the motor units that you recruit will increase the number of
neurons that you recruit and the number of muscle fibers and
particularly these high threshold muscle fibers will increase. And so
it's really only for purposes of hypertrophy that you really need to
be concerned about how quickly the weight is slowing down. However, if
you're trying to get faster, more explosive and generate more speed
and jumping power, throwing power things of that sort, you never
really want to use a weight or get to a portion of the set where
you're moving the bar very, very slowly. And I'm sure as I say that
some of the exercise physiologists and advanced trainers out there
will come after me with pitchforks, which is fine. I'd love to see the
literature that shows that low gear slow movements with very heavy
weights can indeed improve explosiveness. And that may in fact be the
case, but the data that I was able to access was essentially as I
described just a moment ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=4090"&gt;Customizing Training; 1-6 Month Experiments; Key Elements Summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as you're probably starting to realize you need to customize a
resistance practice for your particular needs and goals. And I
certainly am not the first to suggest that people periodize their
training. That they do things from anywhere from one month to six
months, and to see how it goes and to make modifications as they go.
Because the nervous system in particular the neuromuscular system
changes very quickly at the beginning of training. In fact, some of
the changes that one can see when they first embrace or start
resistance training can be very remarkable, but they tend to slow over
time. So we've talked about a few principles. The fact that you need
to get sufficient volume, you need at least five sets to maintain and
you probably need about 10 sets per muscle group in order to improve
muscle. That moving weights of moderate to moderately heavy weight
quickly is going to be best for explosiveness. The isolating muscles
and really contracting muscles hard something that you can test by
just when you're outside the training session, seeing whether or not
you can cramp the muscle hard will tell you your capacity to improve
hypertrophy or to engage strength changes in that muscle. That your
ability to contract a muscle hard is inversely related to the number
of sets that you should do in order to isolate and stimulate that
muscle. And there are some other things that can enhance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=4168"&gt;Focal Contractions Between Sets To Enhance Hypertrophy, Not Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the whole process of building nerve to muscle connections, making them
more efficient and generating if you like more strength and
hypertrophy. One of them I loath to say I was told is in between set
contractions. The other name for this is the people in the gym does
typically seem to be guys in the gym flexing their muscles in between
sets. And indeed the research supports the fact that contractions have
about 30 seconds in between the actual work sets, they're not going to
favor better performance on the work sets, if anything they're going
to compromise them. But those hard contractions in between sets for a
variety of reasons related to local muscle metabolism as well as what
we talked about before which are stress, tension, and damage, they
seem to improve stress, tension, and damage and the nerve to muscle
contraction in ways that facilitate hypertrophy. In other words, if
you see that person flexing in between sets in the gym, provided that
they're really isolating that muscle and provided it's one that they
ought to be improving, not one of these people that always skips leg
day type of people. These people are highly asymmetric although that's
up to them, that process of flexing in between sets does seem to
improve the nerve to muscle connection and enhance hypertrophy. And I
say I was low to say it because nowadays with phones it seems like the
end of every set includes a selfie sort of like the 11th rep of every
set. I like to joke. It seems like very few people are capable of
actually going into the gym and doing a workout without taking a
picture of themselves, which I think is fine if that's your thing.
Although I must say that the athletes that I know and even the
recreational athletes that I know who seem to get the most out of
their training and who also seem to get the most out of other aspects
of their life, seem to be able to control their phone behavior both in
the gym and outside of the gym. But that's more of an editorial point
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=4286"&gt;The Optimal Resistance Training Protocol To Optimize Testosterone Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier episode, I talked about estrogen and testosterone. And
during that discussion, I talked about the use of resistance exercise
specifically for increasing testosterone, both in men and in women.
And indeed that is a powerful effect of resistance exercise. And
indeed it's mediated by the nerve to muscle connections. We talked
about that in that earlier episode. I just want to briefly mention
that protocol since it's distinctly different from the other protocols
I've talked about today. The protocols I've talked about today thus
far of explosive movements or of hypertrophy-based training provided
the training is 60 minutes or less will cause increases in serum
testosterone that's been shown over and over again. And if the session
extends too long, past 75 minutes and is of sufficiently high
intensity chances are testosterone levels will start to drop and
cortisol levels will go up in ways that can be detrimental to recovery
and the goals of the training. But that's different than training
that's specifically geared toward increasing testosterone. Duncan
French, who's one of the directors of the UFC Performance Center, when
he was a graduate student at University of Connecticut Stores did some
beautiful work. He and his colleagues found the ideal training
protocols for stimulating testosterone release which is something that
many people want to do for a variety of reasons. And that involved
doing six sets of 10 repetitions even if it requires lightening the
weight on one set to the next, with about two minutes 120 seconds rest
in between sets. Which if you think of about it is pretty short rest
and is pretty darn hard work. Now, what's interesting is that there's
a very limited threshold for increasing testosterone. That protocol of
six sets of 10 repetitions led to these big increases in serum
testosterone. But if people did 10 sets of 10 so just four more
repetitions per set, then testosterone did not increase. In fact, you
got more of this catabolic cortisol like pathway. You get other
benefits from this so-called 10 sets of 10 protocol, but not the
testosterone increase and maybe even reductions in testosterone. Now,
it's important to point out that that six sets of 10 was done with big
compound movements. So things like squats, or deadlifts, or chin-ups
or things of that sort. And those were done as single sessions not in
concert with a bunch of other exercise, although if athletes are doing
that, there's no reason why they couldn't also do other types of
training elsewhere in the week. I asked Duncan about this and he
mentioned that that done twice a week is probably the maximum that
anyone could do that and still maintain this increase in testosterone.
It's a very interesting protocol because as a neuroscientist, it's
amazing to me that six sets of 10 repetitions with something, causes a
distinctly different result in terms of hormone output than 10 sets of
10 of the exact same movement. And it speaks to the exquisite way in
which nerve to muscle connections dictate the whole physiology of your
entire system. If there's a theme that I really want to bring forward
today is that weight training or resistance training of any kind is
really used for either systemic effects. 10% of training done where
you're feeling that burn which means lactate will be present and
sending signals to your brain, and your heart and your liver that are
beneficial or isolating muscles which may also generate a kind of a
lactate which is associated with the burn result but that isolation of
muscles distinctly different. So systemic versus isolated. Those are
the two general ways in which resistance training can be applied. So I
just wanted to mention that earlier protocol because it's well
supported by the literature. If you were to incorporate that protocol,
you might ask, well, then can you do any other weight training during
the week? And sure, of course you can provided you're recovering. So
let's talk about how you know if you're recovering. How you know if a
muscle is recovered and how you know if your whole system is
recovered. Because recovery is what dictates whether or not you can
come back and do more work of a different kind. Meaning, I don't know,
you do a leg training one day, can you and should you come back and do
the upper body training day? And it dictates whether or not you'll see
any improvement from session to session at all. Before I talk about
recovery I just want to make sure I nailed down the details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=4560"&gt;How Quickly To Complete Repetitions; Interset Rest Times &amp;amp; Activities; Pre-Exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that I was able to extract from the literature and from my
conversation with Dr. Galpin. If you're wondering how quickly to
perform repetitions for sake of hypertrophy or strength gains,
anywhere from a half a second per repetition all the way up to eight
seconds per repetition, it doesn't seem to matter. Again, if you're
thinking about explosiveness or building speed, or you're specifically
using resistance training to build endurance, that's a separate
matter. We talked about explosiveness and speed. I'll talk about
endurance in a few moments. We also talked about in between set
contractions the so called selfie effect of people flexing a
particular muscle, isolating a particular muscle between sets, just
want to mention that would be a terrible thing to do if your goal is
performance on sets. So moving a particular amount of weight. That's
actually going to diminish the amount of weight that you can move.
It's going to enhance muscle growth and it's going to enhance the
nerve to muscle isolation of that particular pathway. So again, that
flexing between sets is going to favor hypertrophy, not performance.
If you're trying to get stronger, you're trying to move more weights,
you're trying to distribute work, and you're trying to do maybe skill
training with resistance then flexing between sets is absolutely the
wrong thing to do for obvious reasons you're fatiguing the muscle
further. Just remaining still or walking around a little bit has been
shown to be beneficial in terms of moving some of the lactate out of
the muscle as well as just recovering between sets. Now, how long to
recover between sets, is a question. For the testosterone protocol,
Duncan French and colleagues found that it was about two minutes
keeping that really on the clock, two minutes not longer. For
hypertrophy and for strength gains, it does seem that resting anywhere
from two minutes or even three or four, even five or six minutes can
be beneficial. And if you're interested in expanding the volume of
work that you can do in a given session at high capacity at high
intensity, with a given weight, please see the episode that I did on
cold and performance about supercharging performance which is based on
the work of my colleague Craig Heller in the Biology Department at
Stanford, which talks about Palmer Cooling, about how you can cool the
core of the body best through the palms using these particular venous
portals that are only present in your hands. People are now doing this
with ice packs or with gel packs. There are a number of different ways
one can do this. I talk all about that in that episode. It allows you
to do more repetitions and more work at a given weight over time. So
rather than getting 10 repetitions and then eight and then seven and
then six through proper use of palmer cooling, one can do 10, 10, 10,
10, and even add sets. And that's one way that one can accomplish
higher volume work without having to drop the weight considerably. So
that's where you can hit that really sweet spot if that's your goal of
getting strong and generating some hypertrophy. Because as soon as you
have to drop to lighter weights, then you're shifting more towards
hypertrophy and endurance and less toward strength of any given
muscle. So check out that episode. The last thing besides between set
contractions and whether or not you're distributing work or whether or
not you're really trying to isolate muscles is this notion of pre-
exhausting muscles. It's been shown over and over again that for
instance, if you want to generate force in a given muscle and really
isolate that, doing the isolation work before a compound movement. So
this would be leg extensions the thing where you sit and you extend
your toes up toward the ceiling. Leg extensions before squats will
allow the squats to target that muscle group more effectively. And
that makes perfectly good sense based on the Henneman's size principle
and fatiguing motor units. It should be obvious why that's the case.
But of course that's going to be anti performance in terms of how much
weight you can lift, and maybe even the form that you can maintain
when you move to the bigger compound movement. So you really have to
ask yourself a number of questions. How good are you at isolating a
given muscle? Therefore, how many sets do you want to do? How often
are you willing to train therefore, how many sets are you going to do
in a given session versus how many are you going to distribute across
the week? Are you aiming for performance? Are you going to distribute
that work across the nervous system and musculature? Are you trying to
move weights? Are you trying to challenge muscles? If you're trying to
challenge muscles, then you really want to focus on things like this
pre exhausting the isolation of a muscle before the compound movement.
Your performance on compound movements will absolutely suffer but your
ability to isolate that muscle and generate hypertrophy through the
accumulation of larger myosin, those bigger balloons, will benefit.
And once again, if you're trying to get faster than the speed of the
movement really matters. So how do we know if we've recovered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=4843"&gt;Tools To Determine If You Have Recovered From Previous Training: Local &amp;amp; Systemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we test recovery? And this is not just recovery from
resistance training, this is recovery from running, recovery from
swimming. Up until now I've been talking about resistance training
more or less in a vacuum. I haven't even touched on the fact that many
people are running and they're doing resistance training or they're
swimming and they're doing resistance training. It's not simply the
case that if a given muscle is fatigued you can just work other
muscles. Because even if you've beautifully isolated a muscle, let's
say you have incredible abilities to isolate just your quadriceps for
instance and you do a workout where you isolate your quadriceps you do
your six sets of intense work or maybe use palmer cooling, and you're
able to do 12 sets of intense work and you're done, and that muscle
group the next day is certainly not going to be recovered unless
you're somebody who's extraordinary at recovery or you're enhancing
your recovery through chemical means which we'll talk about at the
end. Well, you can assess systemic recovery meaning your nervous
system. And your nervous system's ability to generate force both
distributed and isolated through three main tests. And fortunately,
these tests are very simple and two of them are essentially zero cost,
require no equipment. HRV, heart rate variability has made its way
finally into the forefront of exercise physiology and even into the
popular discussion. I've talked about HRV before. How when we exhale,
our heart rate slows down because of the way that our diaphragm is
connected to our heart and to our brain and the way our brain is
connected to our heart. When we inhale our heart rate speeds up and
that is the basis of heart rate variability. Heart rate variability is
good. It means that you're breathing properly, and when I say it's
good it means you want a lot of heart rate variability. You don't want
a heart rate that is high or low consistently over time. That might
come as a bit of a surprise for you endurance athletes, who probably
are trying to accomplish your endurance work at a steady cadence to
really hit that nice sweet spot where you're breathing rhythmically,
your heart rate's going rhythmically. You're in that steady heart
rate, and then away from exercise, you have a nice low heart rate as
they say. Well, nice low heart rate isn't necessarily always so nice.
Turns out the introducing bouts of increasing your heart rate during
exercise and even through your waking day, through stressful events
even is provided their brief is beneficial. A good nerve to heart
system benefits from being able to increase heart rate and decrease
heart rate. Heart rate variability is good. So you don't want high
heart rate, you don't want low heart rate all the time. But heart rate
variability is difficult for a lot of people to measure. There are
some devices that will allow you to do that. Various watches and
devices. There are more devices becoming available all the time.
Hopefully soon, some that are integrated with your phone that involve
no contact or anything on your body. But those do carry some costs and
they are not perfect yet. The measures of heart rate variability that
one can use while in movement are still in that phase I would say of
technology development where everyone isn't using them, let's leave it
at that. There are two measures however, whether or not you recovered
that you can use first thing in the morning when you wake up, maybe
after five, 10 minutes, if you like, but ideally right when you wake
up in order to assess how well recovered you are and therefore whether
or not you should train your whole system at all that day. The first
one his grip strength. Grip strength, the ability to generate force at
the level of squeezing the fist or squeezing down on something, might
seem like kind of a trivial way to assess recovery but it's not
because it relates to your ability to use your upper motor neurons to
control your lower motor neurons and to generate isolated force. So
that's really what you're assessing when you do that. Some people will
use one of these grip tools or Costello has this toy that's shaped
like a donut and it's this hard rubber. And I've tried this before. If
I've been working really hard, not sleeping very well, or I've been
training a lot any one or combination of those things, my grip
suffers. I can't actually squeeze that thing down as much as I can
Costello because he was born with like a 24 inch neck even though he's
never touched a weight somehow he can just clamp down on that thing,
and he can turn it into a pancake with ease and he likes to chuckle
while I struggle with this thing. But on a good day, I can squeeze
this thing so that I eliminate the hole in the donut so to speak. You
can also take a floor scale and squeeze the scale and see how much
force you can generate. I would do that as a baseline to establish
what you can do when you're well rested. And then if you do that in
the morning, you can see whether or not you're able to generate the
same amount of force or you could use over the rubber donut or
something. A lot of this is very subjective with a scale you're really
trying to assess whether or not you can generate the same amount of
force. If you start seeing a 10% or 20% certainly reduction in that
that's concerning, it means that your system, your nervous system as a
whole it's not necessarily fatigued, is that the pathways from nerve
to muscle are still in the process of rewiring themselves in order to
generate force. And you might think, well, I train one muscle group
one day. Why am I having a hard time doing this for a completely
different muscle group? It doesn't make any sense. But there's
something about the upper motor neuron to lower motor neuron pathway
generally that allows you to use something like grip strength as a
kind of a thermometer, if you will of your ability to recover. So look
for your ability to generate force in grip when you first wake up.
It's not going to be as good as it is at 3:00 PM after a cup of coffee
and a couple meals but the point isn't performance overall, the point
is to assess whether or not you're getting better, worse or the same
from day to day. The other one that's really terrific and the Andy
Galpin's group is using. And I'm delighted about this because it
relates to something that my lab is very excited about as well is
carbon dioxide tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=5193"&gt;Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test For Assessing Recovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a really interesting tool that endurance athletes, strength
athletes I think can all benefit from. In fact athletes and people of
all kinds. Even if you're not an athlete, even if you're not
exercising at all, there's a good question of whether or not your
system as a whole is doing okay or not. We rely on the thermometer. Do
we have a fever or not? We rely on subjective things. Do I feel good
or not? Am I digesting well or not? Those are all subjective. The
carbon dioxide tolerance test is, its objective in that it measures
your capacity to engage the so-called parasympathetic arm of your
nervous system which is the calming aspect of your nervous system. And
it measures your ability to consciously control a particular skeletal
muscle, which is your diaphragm. So here's how you do the carbon
dioxide tolerance test. You wake up in the morning. If you have to use
the restroom first, do that, but try and stay away from your phone. If
you have your phone, put it on airplane mode, go to the timer or use a
hand watch or some other way of measuring time, stay off social media
for just a few seconds. It'll be okay. And what you're going to do is
you're going to inhale through your nose as deeply as you can, you can
do this lying down, sitting, whatever inhale through your nose and
then exhale all the way. So that's one. You're going to repeat that
four times. So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale four times. And ideally you're inhaling through the nose and
you're exhaling through the mouth. That's just the beginning of this
carbon dioxide tolerance test. Then you take a fifth inhale as deep as
you can through your nose. Fill your lungs as much as you can, and if
you can try and expand make your stomach go out while you do that,
that means that your diaphragm has really engaged. So you're inhaling
as much as you possibly can. Then hit the timer and your goal is to
release that air as slowly as possible through your mouth. So it looks
like you have a tiny, tiny little straw in your mouth and you're
letting it go. As slowly as you possibly can. Measure what we call the
carbon dioxide blow off time or discard rate. I know you can all sit
with lungs empty after you eliminate all that air, but don't lie to
yourself. Don't stop the timer when you've been sitting with your
lungs empty for a while, stop the timer when you are finally no longer
able to exhale any more air. So you do inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly. I just said it quickly for sake
of time then you can do this fifth big inhale through your mouth, and
then [deep exhale] And I'm not going to do it for the full duration.
And then you're measuring that time. Your carbon dioxide discard rate
will be somewhere between one second and presumably two minutes. Two
minutes would be a heroic carbon oxide discard time. 30 seconds would
be more typical. 20 seconds would be fast. If your carbon dioxide
discard time is 20 or 25 seconds or less, you are not necessarily
recovered from your previous days activities. There's ways to push
through this but hold onto that thought for a moment. If your carbon
oxide discard time is somewhere between about 30 seconds and 60
seconds, you are in what we would call kind of the green zone where
you are in a position to do more physical work. And if your carbon
dioxide discard time is somewhere between 65 and 120 seconds, well
then you have almost certainly recovered your nervous system. I'm not
talking about the individual muscles but your nervous system is
prepared to do more work. And Andy's Lab has great data on this as it
relates to exercise physiology. I think that story should be out in
the not too distant future. My lab has been using carbon oxide discard
time to look at anxiety and recovery from bouts of anxiety. So two
totally independent projects but using the same measure. So you've got
HRV, which requires some technology usually. You've got grip strength,
which you can assess subjectively or you can use a floor scale and now
you have carbon dioxide tolerance. You want to do this in the morning
when you wake up and keep track just write down in a little book, or
maybe just keep tracking your mind of your carbon oxide discard time.
If you find that your discard times are dropping even if they're in
the 42nd range or 52nd range, but normally you can do 75 seconds or
120 seconds. If they're starting to drop by anywhere from 15% to 20%,
you're veering in the direction of not recovering. And I'm really keen
on this tool because everybody has different recovery abilities. Some
people are eating really well and sleeping really well. Some people
have minimal stress or can buffer stress really well. Other people
they dissolve into a puddle of tears if they read one text message
that's troubling or whatever. And I realize, and I say that with
sympathy, I realize people have varying levels of stress and demand in
their life. It's just to to prescribe an entire protocol that says,
okay, yes you should train today and this is exactly what you should
do. No, you shouldn't. Use carbon dioxide discard rate because a, it's
valuable, it's informative. b, it's zero cost and c, it's something
you can track objectively over time. And that's really the key. And
I'd be remiss if I didn't say that what carbon dioxide discard rate is
tapping into is your ability to mechanically control your diaphragm
certainly that's one aspect of it, but that relates in a very direct
way to your ability to put the brake on your stress system. To engage
the so-called parasympathetic or calming arm of your autonomic nervous
system. And another thing that Andy Galpin's group is testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=5563"&gt;The Way To End Every Training Session. How To Breath Between Sets For Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is at the offset of training after your run, after your weight
training session, maybe even after your plyometrics session, we didn't
really talk about jumping and throwing and that sort of thing. Maybe
we'll talk about it in a future episode. But they and other groups,
including some elite athletes and other groups that are very
interested in physical performance are using a tool where they
deliberately disengaged for five minutes at the end of training. They
deliberately engage this calming or parasympathetic arm of the nervous
system. And you can do that through any number of different tools. I'm
a big fan of respiration tools 'cause they're always available to you.
Your breathing is always there. I talk about some of these tools in
previous episodes but you could use things like non sleep deep rest
and SDR at the end of a training session. You could do 10
physiological size, double inhales through the nose followed by long
exhales, that will definitely engage the parasympathetic nervous
system at the end of training. So rather than finish your training
session and then just hop onto your phone, serious athletes and people
who are serious about recovery initiate that recovery at the very end
of their training and they start to kickstart that recovery process
rather and they measure CO2 tolerance in the morning. So there are
several groups that are doing that. In fact, I know several groups
because I'm working with them that are using physiological size
between sets in order to recover their nervous system and maintain
nerve to muscle contractibility. Maintain focus throughout their
training session enhance their focus by doing a few physiological
size. So double inhale, exhale in between sets. So they're getting
very focused and very intense about their strength work or
explosiveness worker, muscle isolation work during their sets. And
then in between sets, they're deliberately disengaging the nervous
system, and then they're re-engaging it again. So I just wanted to
emphasize that. So recovery is a complex process. It's got a lot of
things but the CO2 tolerance set should be a valuable tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=5686"&gt;How &amp;amp; When To Use Cold Exposure To Enhance Recovery; When To Avoid Cold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, another tool for recovery that people are very excited about is
the use of cold and the ice bath. And this is important. If you are
somebody who uses cold through cold shower, or ice bath, or jumping in
a lake, or a river whatever it is that used to generate cold as a
recovery tool, you should be aware that there are data starting to
emerge that if your goal is recovery or strength improvements, using
cold within the four hours following a workout. I'm not talking about
palmer cooling, I'm talking about whole body cooling or cooling from
the neck down. Yes, it will reduce inflammation. Yes, it will reduce
the amount of delayed on muscle soreness one readout of how intense or
damaging a given workout was not the only readout, but it does seem to
interfere with some of the things like mTOR pathways, the mammalian
target of rapamycin pathway and other pathways related to an
inflammation that promote muscle repair and muscle growth. Remember,
stress, tension, and damage or the stimulus for nerve to muscle
connections to change and for muscles to get bigger, stronger, and
better. And so if you're getting into the ice bath after training or
taking a really cold shower after doing resistance training, you are
likely short-circuiting the improvements that you're trying to create.
Now, athletes who are trying to recover quickly so that they can get
back into more training sessions, or let's say you're somebody who
doesn't really want to gain much strength or hypertrophy and you're
mainly focused on endurance and you want to do more endurance work and
you've been weight training, well then exposing yourself to cold can
be beneficial, but you're not going to get as great of benefits from
the resistance training. In other words, cold after resistance
training seems to short circuit some of the benefits of that
resistance training. There are some other things that can short
circuit the benefits of resistance training as well. One of those is
anti-histamines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=5797"&gt;Antihistamines &amp;amp; Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: Can Be Problematic/Prevent Progress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting data were published recently. I believe it was in
scientific reports, yes that showed that anti-histamines can prevent
some of the benefits of cardiovascular exercise of endurance type work
as running, swimming of fairly long duration or even sprint type work,
as well as inhibit some of the processes associated with resistance
training. Remember, it resistance training or endurance training,
that's a stimulus for stress and the adaptation to that stress is how
you get better. That you can run further, faster, lift more weight,
hypertrophy the muscle, et cetera. So anti-histamines can be a
problem. Obviously don't compromise your ability to breathe
completely, but anti-histamines generally work by blocking what are
called mast cells and M-A-S-T. Mast cells are really interesting cells
that we'll talk about in our month on neuro immune function. They
travel in the bloodstream and these little packets that burst open it
sites of inflammation. Muscle damage and inflammation is a signal that
something needs to change. And so taking it to histamines it appears
can disrupt some of that inflammatory process. So you actually want
inflammation during and immediately after a workout, then you want to
bring inflammation down later and I'll mention how to do that. The
other thing are non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs you know their
trade names. These are painkillers that many people take. Those as
I've mentioned in a previous episode can interfere with the benefits
of endurance training and the benefits of resistance training. In
addition to that, they block pain signals and pain is a very good
signal that you might be doing something wrong. And so while nobody
likes to be in pain, I suppose there are probably a few people out
there like to be in pain, but that's a different story but nobody
likes to be in pain. The non-steroid anti-inflammatory the NSAIDs as
they're called, and the anti-histamines seem to prevent a lot of the
gains the improvements in endurance, strength and size that people are
specifically using exercise for. So be cautious about your use of non-
steroid anti-inflammatory drugs especially within the four hours
preceding or the four hours following exercise. So I hope you're
starting to get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=5922"&gt;Foundational Supplements For Recovery: EPA, Vitamin D3, Magnesium Malate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to change the nerve to muscle connectivity in ways that will
better serve you, you need a stressor during the actual training which
particular stressor depends on your training goals. But that stressor
is almost always going to be associated with inflammation, and then
after the training, you want to try and get into a state of reduced
inflammation. And that's why you would do some sort of protocol non
sleep depressed which we will link to in our caption or perhaps you
would use the hypnosis app that we've talked about before Reveri, R-E-
V-E-R-I.com. There's a great app for accessing deep rest states or the
physiological side to try and get your system to calm down after
training. There are also tools that one can use to reduce inflammation
at a kind of foundational level away from training. And these are
tools that I've talked about many times before, but I'll just restate
them again. The kind of Golden Three according to Andy Galpin and the
ones that he recommends are sufficient omega-3s again, that can be
accomplished through diet, through whole food intake or through
supplementation or both. So in general, getting above a 1,000
milligrams of EPA per day to keep inflammation low or relatively low.
Vitamin D and in some cases, magnesium malate. Magnesium malate seems
to be particularly effective in offsetting delayed onset muscle
soreness. Soreness itself is not required for improvements in
strength, improvements in explosiveness, improvements in hypertrophy.
That's a myth. Now, if you do experience delayed onset muscle
soreness, chances are you stressed that particular muscle pretty well
or even maybe to well, maybe you stressed it too much and you need
longer recovery. There's a total debate out there about whether or not
you should train again when a muscle is still sore. I think the
general takeaway is, no that means it's not recovered. And there are
things of course like massage, like fascial release and things of that
sort sauna, cold that can perhaps accelerate the movement from
soreness to not sore. But in general, the omega-3, vitamin D, and
magnesium malate trio seemed to be an effective way to reduce
inflammation at kind of a systemic level. But remember you want
inflammation provided you're not damaging the muscles so much that
you're injured during the training session because that's the stimulus
for change in those muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=6068"&gt;Ensuring Proper Nerve-Muscle Firing: Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about a few other things that support the process of
nerve to muscle communication and touch on some of the things that a
lot of people are doing to try to "enhance their workouts" and
evaluate whether or not those are in fact enhancing workouts or not.
Because weight training, unlike a lot of other forms of exercise has a
unique aspect to it, which is this feature that I guess some people
call it the pump which is the fact that blood goes into the muscle
when you train, it's the only gun of training where you actually get a
window into what the result might actually look like before you
actually accomplish that result. So if you think about when you go out
for a hard run and let's say you go out for a two mile run, let's say
your goal is to break you want to do a sub ten two mile. Actually,
when I went to university I was running cross country, my senior year
of high school and I wanted to walk on for the cross country team. And
so I went out there and turned out you had to do a sub 10, two mile.
And I think the best mile I ever ran in high school was a 457, which
isn't terrible. I can't do that now. It's not even close to what the
best high school athletes can do now. But that would have meant doing
it back-to-back. So it was sub 10 minute two mile didn't even come
close. I told Costello this story the other day and he just kind of
laughed at me. He was like, why would you even want to run two miles?
Because Costello is built almost exclusively of these type two fast
twitch muscles they're designed for moving objects. He's incredibly
strong. He has been since he was a puppy. I mean that dog could
probably drag a tractor if he wanted to, but he can't really go far.
Whereas a Greyhound or a Whippet or some of these other sight hounds
or scent hounds can go, go, go. They have a higher percentage of the
so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers. They are much better at
endurance. So a sub-10 two mile would have been very, very
challenging, no chance I could have done that. I don't think even with
a lot of training. But let's say that you want to improve your
performance in a given type of exercise. Let's talk about some of the
things that seem to work across the board to improve strength, improve
hypertrophy, and improve nerve to muscle communication and
performance. The first thing that's absolutely key for nerve to muscle
communication and physical performance of any kind might not sound
that exciting to you but it is very exciting. And that's salt. Nerves
cells, neurons communicate with each other and communicate with muscle
by electricity. But that electricity is generated by particular ions
moving into and out of the neuron. And the rushing in of a particular
ion, sodium, salt is what allows nerve cells to fire. If you don't
have enough salt in your system your neurons and your brain and your
nerve to muscle communication will be terrible. If you have sufficient
salt, it will be excellent. How much salt will depend on how much
water you're drinking, how much caffeine you're drinking, and how much
food you're ingesting. And whether or not you're taking any diuretics
how hot it is, et cetera, how much you're sweating. So you want to
make sure that you have enough salt, potassium and magnesium in your
system if you want to perform well. I realized that salt isn't very
glamorous performance tool but it is a vital. Its absolutely vital.
And the endurance athletes and the people that train in high heat can
speak to the fact that when your electrolytes are low, your brain
doesn't function, your body doesn't function nearly as well. In fact,
even for mental work, for studying and for writing and for doing math
and coding, doing analytic work of any kind, even a hard conversation
that's important to you, having sufficient electrolytes is really
going to help and being low on electrolytes won't help and just
drinking water won't help because you need electrolytes. The other
thing that's been shown over and over again, a numerous well-
controlled studies to improve muscle performance is creatine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=6300"&gt;Creatine: Good? How Much? Cognitive Effects. Hormonal Considerations: DHT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on there was a lot of controversy about creatine but there are
many studies if you want, you can go to this website that everyone now
knows I love which is this free website examined.com that there are no
fewer than 18 studies there. 66 studies... So 18 studies supporting
that muscle creating content can be increased by ingesting creatine.
How much creatine? Well, I asked the experts and they tell me that for
somebody who is about 180 pounds, five grams a day should be
sufficient or so. Heavier than 180, so if you got like if you're a 220
pound or 230 pound person, 10 to 15 grams of creatine. People lighter
than 180 pounds maybe three to five grams of creatine or even one to
three grams. Creatine is a fuel source for early in bouts of activity
for high intensity activity. It is also a fuel source for neurons in
the brain and it can have some cognitive enhancing effects. So
creatine is a very interesting molecule. Early on when it was released
as a supplement, it was thought that you had to load it in higher
dosages for a few days and then maintain it at lower dosages. So you'd
take 20 or 30 grams a day then back off to five or 10. It doesn't seem
to be the case that you can get all the benefits from taking the
dosages at the low level. I just mentioned a few moments ago as they
relate to body weight throughout. So salt and electrolytes absolutely
key. You need those present. You need to be well hydrated. Creatine
seems to have a performance enhancing effect. There are 66 studies, 66
showing that power output is greatly increased anywhere from 1%2 to
20%. And this is sprinting and running and jumping as well as
weightlifting by creatine. The ability to hydrate your body is
improved by creating because of the way that it brings more water into
cells of various kinds. As an indirect effect, it can help in
increasingly mass because of the way that it brings more water into
muscle and probably also because of the way that if you get stronger,
you can generate more force and generate more hypertrophy. It reduces
fatigue. Seven studies have shown that it reduces fatigue. There are
even some interesting effects on improving cognition after traumatic
brain injury. Although that's a serious medical condition in
situations you absolutely should talk to a board certified physician
before adding anything or taking anything out of your current regimen.
There are a few other effects that are interesting and notable, but
the big ones are the ones that I referred to before about increased
power output, et cetera. And I just want to emphasize that creatine
can increase this hormone that we talked about in the testosterone
episode, dihydrotestosterone which is testosterone converted by five
alpha reductase into dihydrotestosterone. It's the more dominant
androgen in humans. Leads to increases in strength and libido and so
forth. It also can increase male pattern baldness. Some people, not
everybody experience some hair loss with creatine other people don't.
Some people experience accelerated beard growth because basically
[mumbles] has the opposite effect on hair follicles on the face as it
does on the scalp, some people don't. Women who ingest creatine there
are essentially no data showing that it increases hair loss or facial
hair growth, but of course, everyone is different. So you can go to
examine.com. You can explore those studies. So creatine definitely a
powerful performance enhancing molecule. The other one, one that
personally I've never tried but that seems to have a very strong and
well-supported effects is beta-alanine. Now, beta-alanine is
interesting because when you hear about weight training you think
about heavy deadlifts and bench presses all that kind of stuff that
people are doing. But beta-alanine seems to support exercise that is
of slightly longer duration. So a mix of anaerobic and aerobic type
movement. These are physical performance in the 60 to 242nd range. So
you can use your mind and kind of figure out. Things that weights that
limit you to 8 to 15 repetitions. Cardiovascular exercise of the sort
like rowing or sprinting. So interval work, it seems to help with that
kind of work. So we're not talking about long runs, we're not talking
about heavy deadlifts. The standard dose is somewhere between two and
five grams, again, as always check with a doctor, make sure these
things are safe for you. I'm not responsible for your health. You are.
I don't say that just to protect me. I'd say that also to protect you
but it really seems to improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic
running capacity, reduce fatigue. There are even some interesting
effects on reduction of body fat and improvements in lean mass. So
creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes, these are kind of the core three
things that seem to improve performance and are well supported by the
scientific literature. And in the earlier episode on supercharging
performance we talked about palmer cooling. That's certainly a
performance enhancing tool. It's nothing you ingest your cooling your
palms in a very specific way. That's very powerful. Now, what about
for longer duration bouts of exercise? We've mainly been focusing on
resistance training,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=6612"&gt;Beta-Alanine, Beet Juice; Note About Arginine &amp;amp; Citrulline &amp;amp; Cold Sores&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but what about for long runs, long swims, these kinds of things? Well,
it does seem that juice and ingesting things like arginine and
citrulline can improve performance for those long bouts of exercise
that's mainly going to be due to effects of those compounds on
vasodilation. It's going to open up the vasculature and allow more
blood flow. Do note that things like citrulline and arginine can have
some side effects if you will. They can increase the likelihood of
having herpes cold sore outbreaks on the mouth. The arginine is in the
pathway by which I don't know if people know this, but the herpes
virus lives on neurons of the trigeminal nerve that innervates the
lips and the eyes and the mucus membranes of the face. So this is the
herpes type 1 simplex virus. The virus lives on those neurons and then
periodically inflames those neurons, and that's what leads to the cold
sores seems like arginine and citrulline can lead to increases in cold
sores and canker sores, and outbreaks of those kinds. So you want to
be aware of that. That's not everybody, and not everybody is caring
HSV-1, just be aware that I think it's now 80% or 90% of people by
time they're 12 years old, they've contracted HSV-1. It's very
contagious and typically one outbreak, and then only under conditions
of stress or heightened arginine or citrulline ingestion we'll have
them later. Again, this is not necessarily an STI, a sexually
transmitted infection. This is an infection that is passed very easily
from mucous membranes, just in terms of touching objects and things of
that sort. Very common in the general population. Any discussion about
muscle and muscle performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=6720"&gt;Nutrition: Protein Density: Leucine Thresholds; Meal Frequency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would not be adequate if we didn't mention something about nutrition,
but rather than have a whole discussion about nutrition, 'cause
there's lots of information about that online, for instance, if you
want to gain muscle that you need to have a calorie surplus of about
10 to 15%. You could have a calorie surplus of more. If you want to
avoid gaining weight then you would not create a calorie surplus, et
cetera. You can find all that information online. That's not what this
podcast is really about. We had a month where we talked a lot about
hormones and food and moods. We talked about foods, but more as they
relate to the nervous system. When it comes to supporting muscle. So
supporting the synthesis of larger what I called myosin balloons, it
does seem that ingesting 700 to 3000 milligrams of the essential amino
acid leucine with each meal is important. Now, that does not
necessarily mean from supplements. In fact, most people recommend that
you get your protein, you get your amino acids, including your
essential amino acids and your leucine from whole foods. High quality
proteins aren't high density proteins. What do you mean by that? Well,
it is true that a lot of sources of protein are found in things like
beans and nuts and things like that that all the essential amino acids
can be found there but per unit calorie, if it's in your practice, if
it's in your ethics to ingest animal proteins, it's true that for
instance, 200 calories of steak or chicken or fish or eggs will have a
higher density of essential amino acids than the equivalent amount of
calories from nuts or plants. That's just simply the way it works. So
for the vegans and vegetarians I'm certainly, I'm not saying there's
no way that you can support muscle growth. You absolutely can. Some of
them might want to supplement leucine but this 700 to 3000 milligrams
of leucine per meal is one of the best ways that's been shown to
support the synthesis of more myosin if your goal is hypertrophy and
it's also the way that you would support muscle repair if your goal is
strength. So that's specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy and
strength. And I encourage you to think about this protein density
issue. And whether or not you ingest animal proteins or you don't, to
think about whether or not you're getting sufficient essential amino
acids, especially leucine. Now, many people have addressed the
question of whether or not you need to eat six or seven times a day.
It turns out that you don't that's kind of the old school thinking
that you need to eat very frequently. I think for certain athletes
were very active for drug assisted meaning people that are enhancing
their testosterone levels to super physiological levels, where they
are experiencing very heightened levels of protein synthesis and they
can utilize all that. That might make sense. Again, I'm not supporting
the use of those performance enhancing drugs but there are people
doing that. And that's one of the reasons why they eat so frequently.
And so much protein for typical people who are not doing that, I
imagine most of you are not. Then it does appear that you need to eat
but you don't need to eat six or seven times a day. It does seem like
not eating once a day is also important. So somewhere between one meal
a day and six meals a day, lies the more reasonable two or three or
maybe four times a day. I think that a whole discussion about this is
warranted and we'll have this discussion with Dr. Galpin at a future
time of whether or not eating protein more frequently can enhance this
myosin synthesis. But I think the simple takeaway from the literature
that I was able to extract and from my discussion with him is, eating
two to four times a day, making sure you're getting sufficient amino
acids in a way that's compatible with your ethics and with your
nutritional regimen is going to support muscle repair, muscle growth
strength improvements, et cetera, just fine. There's one more thing
that I'd like to cover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=6954"&gt;Why Hard Workouts Can Make It Hard To Think/Do Mental Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is the relationship between particular kinds of exercise and our
ability to think and perform cognitive functions. We all hear that
exercise is so vital for our brain that it supports our brain health
and our body health. And indeed that's true provided it's done
correctly. However, many of us are familiar with the experience of
going for a run or going for a swim or working out hard in the gym,
and then not being able to use our brain to be essentially useless for
cognitive functions for the rest of the day. I discussed this with Dr.
Galpin this morning, and I learned something very interesting, which
is that hard bouts of exercise of the sort where you're training near
failure or you're generating focused muscular contractions, for
obsession that lasts anywhere from, I don't know, 30, 45 minutes,
maybe 60 minutes or a long run where you're engaging in some interval
training during that run, after exercise, there's a reduction in
oxygenation of the brain. So there's actually a quite significant dip
in the amount of oxygen that your neurons are getting and therefore
your ability to think. So it's important that you control the
intensity and the duration of your training sessions so that you're
still able to do well in life and lean to life the way you need to,
because I'm guessing most of you are not in a position to just
prioritize your physical training you also need to use your minds. I'm
certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise but also the
requirement of needing to perform cognitive work throughout the day.
It also turns out that you can leverage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=7045"&gt;Leveraging Weight Training &amp;amp; Rest Days To Optimize Cognitive Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways
that can benefit cognitive function and focus. And it has to do with
the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of
intense focused effort. So let's say you're doing resistance training
two or three times a week, maybe even four times a week and you're
doing it consistently at a given time. There are clocks, literally
biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to
predict that focus and that intense work. If you are trying to get
intense cognitive work done, you might try scheduling that cognitive
work on the days when you don't do physical training at the same time
when you normally would do that intense, focused physical training.
Because the systems of the body that generate acetylcholine release
and other neuromodulators, the systems, of the body and brain that
generate focused effort, those are on this sort of clock mechanism in
a way that you likely will find that after just a week of training at
regular times you will be able to focus readily on other things when
you're not training provided you do it during the period of time of
day when you normally would train. So is kind of an indirect positive
effect. You're harnessing the focus and the expectation of focus in
your nervous system for that particular time of day. And of course,
we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about time of day for training. It
turns out that whether or not you train in the morning or in the
afternoon, it doesn't really seem to matter for sake of things like
hypertrophy and strength, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=7138"&gt;What Time Of Day Is Best To Resistance Train?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to have a time of day that they prefer to train. I've
said before and their reasons based on body temperature rhythms and
cortisol release that training 30 minutes, three hours or 11 hours
after your normal waking time can be very beneficial and can provide a
sort of predictability or regularity to when your body will be ready
to train and best apt to train well. There is some evidence that
training in the afternoon is better for performance, whereas training
for body composition changes and strain changes, et cetera doesn't
really matter when you train. So you also want to make it compatible
with sleep, compatible with work that really gets down into the wits
of optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLr2RKoD-oY&amp;amp;t=7180"&gt;More Information Resources, Subscribing (Zero-Cost) To Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it's interesting to note that if you're going to train at
a regular time, you can take the days when you don't train and use
that to enhance your cognitive focus for things that have nothing to
do with exercise. So this might be writing, or reading, or music, or
math, et cetera. Typically, I restrict these podcast episodes to about
90 minutes. So called ultradian cycle for learning. Today was a bit
longer. And I admit that I tried to pack a lot into this. It is the
last episode in this month on physical performance. I figured in this
case more is better especially since everything is time-stamped for
you. You certainly don't have to watch it all at once and you can come
back to it over and over again into the precise locations in the
episode that you like in order to take notes or extract the
information that you need. I'd like to point you to Dr. Andy Galpin
page. I highly recommend looking into the work that he's doing if you
want more details. He's very, very skilled, excellent communicator. He
superb at what he does. He's a professor. He works with athletes. He
works with typical folks in the exercise and muscle physiology world.
Brad Schoenfelds work. I also have a lot of respect for. I've never
met him. I don't know him. There's no paid endorsement here. They're
not sponsors are related to the podcast in any way. I just think the
work is of very high quality and they're both on the academic side and
the practical side. And of course there are other people out there
doing fabulous work in this area as well. If you like this podcast and
you're benefiting from the information that you're learning and you
want to support us, the simplest and most straightforward way to do
that is a zero cost way which is subscribe to the podcast on YouTube.
Click the Subscribe button and to subscribe on Apple and Spotify as
well. That really helps us. It helps us get the message about the
podcasts out more broadly generally, and it ensures that you don't
miss any episodes. We release episodes every Monday, but starting
soon, and from time to time, we release shorter episodes in between.
So you'll be sure to hear those episodes. In addition, check out the
sponsors that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast. If you
like and if you're able to, supporting us through those sponsors is a
terrific way to support our production staff and the podcast
generally. A zero cost way to support the podcast is to tell your
friends, tell your neighbors, tell anyone that you think might benefit
from the information. The way this podcast is set up, the information
is batched into four or five episodes, all centered around a given
theme or topic like hormones, like sleep. So the episodes on sleep,
for instance that were way back in January, and what seems like way
back are still every bit as relevant today as they were back in
January for somebody that has challenges with sleep and wants to
understand sleep and get better at sleep or wants to understand their
dreams or how to use sleep and dreaming to leverage neuroplasticity
and learning. So if you pass information along about the podcast,
that's great. We also have a Patreon. You can go to
patreon.com/andrewhuberman. There, you can support the podcast at any
level that you like. And as always, please put your questions about
the podcast episodes and suggestions for future episodes. In the
comment section. I really do read through all those comments. It takes
me some time, but I do read through those. I reply to as many of them
as I can, but I do read them. And they're great way for us to get
feedback. On Apple you can give us a five-star review if you think we
deserve that. And if you want to do all these things you're welcome
to, if you want to do just one of them, we understand. And if you do
none of them, we still appreciate that you come here to digest the
information about science and science-related tools. In today's
episode, I mentioned various supplements, various compounds that if
you deem it right and safe for you can benefit athletic performance
and muscle physiology, et cetera. We've partnered with Thorne T-H-O-R-
N-E because Thorne supplements we believe are of the highest possible
stringency in quality. What you see on the bottle is what's in the
bottle and the quality of ingredients that they include are excellent.
So much so that they partner with the Mayo Clinic and all the major
sports teams. If you go to Thorne T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman, you can
see all the supplements that I take and you can get 20% off any of
those supplements as well as 20% off any of the other supplements that
Thorne sells. So if you go to thorne.com/u/huberman any of those
supplements listed there and then if you navigate through their site

using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of

increases fat oxidation-- it turns out the type and duration of
exercise really matters. And I discuss the use of caffeine, GLP1 from

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles
at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information about science and science related tools
to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank
the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and
help you reach your health goals. I've been getting my blood work done
for many years now, and that's where the simple reason that only
through quality blood work, and now through the advent of DNA test can
one really get a clear picture of what's going on with their health.
Things like metabolic factors and hormones, all the various
triglycerides. These are things that can only be measured from a
quality blood test. And now with DNA tests, you can get an additional
window into your current health status and the trajectory of your
health. What's really wonderful about InsideTracker is that you don't
just get numbers back about the specific levels of various hormones
and metabolic factors, you also get a lot of information about what
you could or should do in order to adjust those numbers to put you on
the course to better health. So for instance, it will give
recommendations about particular foods to eat or avoid, particular
exercise regimens that you might want to adopt and the frequency of
those regimens in order to move those markers in the correct
direction. InsideTracker has also added a new feature that makes
tracking your progress and analyzing your data even easier. For those
of you that use a Garmin fitness tracker such as the Garmin watch,
that's now compatible with their platform. So you can couple your data
from your Garmin with your blood and DNA for even more personalization
and insights on your health. However, if you don't have a Garmin
device, there's still a lot that you can get from InsideTracker and

podcast is also brought to us by ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN is a virtual
private network that keeps your data secure and private. It does that
by routing your internet activity through their servers and encrypting
it, so that no one can see or sell your data. I'm familiar with the
effects of not securing my data well enough. A few years back I had my
bank accounts hacked. I don't know exactly how it happened, but it
happened. And it was a terrible amount of work to have that reversed
and secured. The great thing about ExpressVPN is I don't even notice
that it's running. I have it on my computer, I turn it on anytime I
work at home or when traveling or in a cafe airport anywhere, and it
runs in the background, it doesn't change anything about the interface
with my computer or the wifi. It just secures my data and it secures
any information about what I happen to be searching for, et cetera. I
don't feel like I have anything particular to hide except my bank
account passwords and things of that sort. But with ExpressVPN, it
basically makes everything secure, you can't be tracked and no one can
access or steal your data, which is terrific. So again, I use it when
I'm traveling and when I'm at home. If you want to start protecting

brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink, that gives you a total foundation
of vitamins and minerals and probiotics to support your health and
wellbeing. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012. And so I'm
delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. I started using
Athletic Greens and I still use Athletic Greens once or twice a day
because it's the simplest and most straightforward way to get my basis
of important vitamins, minerals and probiotic taken care off. All of
those things combined to support various aspects of my health, such as
brain health, such as gut health. For instance, there's a tremendous
amount of evidence now showing that probiotics support gut health and
that the gut brain access is important for things like focus and
cognition, as well as for immune function and various aspects of
physical health, like metabolism. The list sort of goes on and on.
With Athletic Greens, it has all these vitamins and minerals and
various other things that are good for me, and I actually really liked
the way it tastes. So the way I use it is once a day, sometimes twice
a day, I'll mix it up with water, I add a little bit of lemon or lime
juice. I think it tastes great without the lemon or lime juice. But
when I add that, it's truly delicious to me. And I'll drink that first
thing in the day, mid-morning sometimes instead and sometimes again in
the later afternoon. I'm able to drink Athletic Greens late in the day
and not have it keep me awake. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you
can go to www.athleticgreens.com/huberman, and if you do that, you can
claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which
make mixing up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, really simple
and easy. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3+K2. Vitamin
D3, as many of you know, you can get from the sun, but many people
even if they're already getting a lot of sun exposure, still have
vitamin D3 levels that are too low. And vitamin D3 is very important
for a huge number of cardiovascular, immune, metabolic and other
aspects of health. So once again, if you go to
www.athleticgreens.com/huberman, you'll get the five travel packs and
a year supply of vitamin D3+K2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=360"&gt;Fat Loss: The Key Role of Neurons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the third episode in our series of episodes about physical
and athletic skill performance and skill learning in general. And
today we're going to talk about the science of tools for fat loss. And
fat loss is something that interests a large number of people. Many
people want to lose fat, many people are athletes who need to lose
fat. And in general, we know that having body fat percentages that are
too high is unhealthy for us. And most people struggle to lose fat.
Most people struggled to lose weight generally, but most people
especially struggled to lose body fat or what we call adipose tissue.
Now, this is a huge topic on the internet. There's a lot of
controversy. Today, we're going to talk about some things related to
fat loss, and that are powerful for fat loss that I'm guessing most of
you have never heard about before. You may have heard about a few of
them, but I'm guessing you haven't heard about all of them. This
episode is going to be rich with science-based tools that are gleaned
from a variety of aspects of the literature, including the use of
cold, including brown fat, including something called beige fat. We're
going to talk about something called NEAT. We're going to talk about
all sorts of aspects of fat loss that are governed by your nervous
system. And this is I think an important gap that's missing in the
discussion about fat loss. You can hear a lot of information out there
about the role of things like insulin and various diets like ketogenic
diets or vegan diets or Mediterranean diets. And there's some great
stuff out there, and there's some really terrible information out
there, and there's a lot of controversy. We did a number of episodes
talking about the role of hormones on metabolism and the role of food
on mood and wellbeing. So if you're interested in those topics, please
check them out. I will touch a little bit on hormones today. Things
like insulin and leptin, just a little bit. But today's episode is
mainly going to be focused on, how the nervous system, neurons, and
some of the cells they collaborate with, like glioma and macrophages,
how those encourage or can encourage accelerated fat loss. Because it
turns out they can. Remember your nervous system which includes your
brain and your spinal cord and all the connections that they make with
the organs of the body, governs everything. It's the on switch and the
off switch for immune system. It's the on switch and the off switch.
It turns out also for fat burning. And so the nervous system and the
role of the brain and other neurons has been vastly overlooked in the
discussion about losing fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=524"&gt;The First Law of Fat Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I would be remiss and I'd probably come under a pretty
considerable attack, if I didn't just acknowledge upfront a core truth
of metabolic science and also of neuroscience, frankly, which is that
calories in versus calories out, meaning how many calories you ingest,
versus how many calories you burn is the fundamental and most
important formula in this business of fat loss and weight management
in general. There's simply no way around the fact that if you ingest
far more calories than you burn, you're likely to gain weight. And a
good portion of that weight is likely to be adipose tissue fat. It's
also true that if you ingest fewer calories than you burn, that you
will lose weight, and that a significant portion of that will come
from body fat. What portion? Depends on a number of factors. But that
simple formula is important. On a previous episode, I mentioned the
complications with the statements of a calorie is a calorie. And
indeed there is evidence from for instance Robert Lustig, who's a
pediatric endocrinologist at UC San Francisco has talked about how
highly processed foods change the way that we utilize food, and can
lead to higher incidences of obesity and other metabolic syndromes
that go against the idea that a calorie is a calorie and that's it. So
a calorie is a calorie as a unit of energy, and we need to accept and
acknowledge this calories in, meaning calories ingested versus
calories burned formula. But the calories burn portion is strongly
influenced by a number of things that you can control that can greatly
accelerate or increase the amount of adipose tissue or the proportion
of adipose tissue that you burn in response to exercise and food. So
your hormones are important. Your thermogenic milieu, meaning how warm
or how cold your body is? How cold you make it, how warm you make it?
But also your level of metabolism. Your levels of thyroid hormone and
something that's hardly ever discussed, but is well supported by the
scientific literature, how much innervation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=660"&gt;Neurons Connect To Fat! (&amp;amp; That Really Matters)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning how much connectivity there is, between your nervous system
and fat. Today, we're going to talk about the fact that your body fat
of various kinds, and there are several kinds of body fat are actually
innervated by neurons. Neurons connect to your body fat and can change
the probability that that body fat will be burned or not. So your
nervous system is the master controller of this process, and it plays
a strong role in the calories out, the calories burned component. So
as usual, we're going to discuss a little bit of science. I promise I
won't go too deep into lipolysis and all sorts of things related to
fat oxidation. We're going to break down that process into two
important steps. And if you can understand those two important steps
then the rest of the tools will be very straightforward to understand
and manage. And I do believe that today you will walk away with many
new tools that you could incorporate into any kind of fat loss regimen
that will greatly accelerate that process, because it's grounded in
quality peer-reviewed science. Throughout the episode, I'm going to
talk about some behavioral tools. In fact, I'll mostly talk about
behavioral tools. I will also talk about compound, supplements. Many
of you are into supplements. Some of you aren't, and that's fine. For
those of you that are into supplements, an important issue in a
discussion about supplements for fat loss or otherwise is going to be
the quality of those supplements and the accuracy about what's in
those supplement bottles and tablets, et cetera. I usually mention
this at the end of the podcast, but this podcast we've partnered with
Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E. Because Thorne we believe has the highest levels
of stringency in terms of the quality of the compounds in their
supplements and the amounts of those compounds. If you want to see the
supplements I take, you can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman. You can
see the supplements that I take, that will also allow you to get 20%
off any of those supplements, or 20% off any of the other supplements
that Thorne makes. Thorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic and all
the major sports teams. So there's a very strong basis for their
stringency. Again, you don't need to use supplements. I'm certainly
not encouraging anyone to use supplements if that's not your thing,
but if you're going to use supplements, make sure that your supplement
source is one a very high quality. With that said, I want to get
started and talk about the various tools for fat loss and how
neuroscience, neurons control fat loss. Before I do that, I want to
set the context correctly and extract some of the key takeaways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=818"&gt;5 Pillars of Metabolism: Sleep, Essential Fatty Acids, Glutamine, Microbiome, Thyroid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from previous episodes, because if your foundation of health and your
foundation of hormones and your foundation of metabolism isn't right,
it's going to be very hard to get the most out of any kind of exercise
or fat loss protocol. In previous episodes, I talked all about the
science and the details going into particular protocols. We don't have
time to do that now, and I want to get to the new material. However,
there are a couple bins, a couple items that you should make sure
you're getting correctly. And if you're not perfect about these, don't
worry about it, most people are not perfect about them, I'm certainly
not perfect about them. But we should all be striving to get quality
and sufficient sleep. I did four full episodes on sleep and how to get
better at sleeping through things like light exposure, temperature,
timing your sleep correctly for your so-called chronotype, if you're a
night owl or a morning person. That's the first four or I think five
episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast. Get your sleep right, get your
light exposure right, avoid bright light in your eyes at times you
wanted to be asleep, and get bright light in your eyes at times you
want to be awake. So get your sleep right. The other thing is
essential fatty acids. I talked about this in the food and mood
episode, but I also talked about it during the hormones episodes. We
need fatty acids. They are vital to so many aspects of our health. You
don't have to get them from supplements. You can, if you want to, but
you need to get them from your food. They are essential. There's a
reason there's an E the essential part there. Of the fatty acids,
there are multiple kinds, but for the antidepressant effects where the
levels of fatty acids that will promote good mood and also healthy
metabolism and we'll start to shift the needle in the right direction
on bloodborne cardiovascular factors. The key thing is to get the
levels of EPA that you ingest above 1000 milligrams per day. So that
doesn't mean just taking a thousand milligrams or more of say fish oil
or krill oil or whatever your preferred source is. It means getting
above a thousand milligrams of EPA which may require that you ingest
more essential fatty acids than just a thousand milligrams per day.
That of course can be done through food sources, things like fatty
fish, or if you're not into eating fish, you've quality meats that are
grass raised can do that. There are other sources of essential fatty
acids, of course also from plant sources. So look, those up online.
It's really easy to find. But the research and the literature shows
that you want to get above a thousand milligrams of EPA per day,
because that's when you can best support your metabolism and position
yourself for good fat loss. As well for people who have cravings
issues, they crave sweets all the time, I talked about this in the
gut-brain episode and hormones and food. That you have neurons in your
gut that are craving, they're seeking essential fatty acids and
they're craving and seeking amino acids from your food. Now, these are
not supplements that they crave per se, they're craving those things
because that's what your body needs and your brain needs. But those
same neurons will respond to sugars. And so many people who are
craving sugar can satisfy that sugar craving by giving the neurons so
to speak what they actually want, which are amino acids and essential
fatty acids. That includes EPA, but also things like glutamine and
amino acid that can really reduce sugar cravings if you take a
teaspoon of that, or even a tablespoon of that a few times a day. You
have to ease into that a little bit, because some people can get a
little bit of GI distress from too much glutamine. But glutamine has
also been shown to improve symptoms of leaky gut. It's a powerful
amino acid. And yes, you can also get it from food. Things like
cottage cheese are high in glutamine, et cetera. And then finally you
can't really position yourself to have a strong metabolism if your
iodine levels aren't correct, and your thyroid levels aren't correct.
You can overdo iodine. So you don't want to do that. A lot of table
salt has iodine added to it, but some people need to add iodine, by
ingesting things like kelp, et cetera.. But one of the best ways to
support the thyroid system and metabolism in general, is to make sure
you're getting enough selenium. Sometimes called selenium each day.
Simple way to do that is to ingest the highest concentration of
selenium food that I'm aware of, which is Brazil nuts, one or two or
three of those per day. You'll have more than enough selenium to meet
the thyroid needs. You don't want your selenium to be too high, you
don't want a diet too high in anything. So again, sleep, sufficient
EPAs, glutamine if you have issues with leaky gut or sugar cravings
can really help. Get your gut microbiome, right? I may have missed
saying that, but get your gut microbiome right. That does not
necessarily mean you need to ingest probiotics. You can, if you want
to, but you can also just simply ingest a serving or two of fermented
foods per day, that can greatly assess. So things like sauerkraut,
kimchi, every culture has a different source or sources of fermented
foods, those can really help the gut microbiome, and then make sure
that your thyroid hormone is supported through the ingestion of
sufficient iodine not too much and sufficient selenium, not too much.
Okay? Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods, iodine and selenium.
That sets the basis for how things like exercise, cold and some of the
compounds and other things that we're going to talk about today that
are I'm guessing going to be truly new to many of you that can really
increase the burn factor in the equation of calories in versus
calories burned. Okay? So on the one hand we have this reality of
calories in, versus calories burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=1160"&gt;Mindset Truly Matters: Amazing Examples of Beliefs on Fat Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I would also be remiss if I didn't mention an incredible
study that was done by my colleague, Alia Crum at Stanford. She's a
faculty member, professor in the psychology department. Looking at how
belief affects, just thinking can impact the effects of things like
exercise on weight loss. These are just incredible results. What they
did was they took subjects who were hotel service people that would
clean the hotels and come in and change the linens and so forth.
Divide them into two groups. One group, they were told moving around
and doing your duties for your job, meet the standards for US
guidelines for activity and movement, et cetera. And a basic lecture
about how movement is good for you, et cetera. But mostly just that
their daily activities met the standards for the US. The other group,
however, was given a bunch of information about how movement and their
daily routine was very good for cardiovascular health, it could be
good for weight loss, et cetera. And then they tracked these subjects
over a period of many weeks. The take home message from this study was
that simply being told that movement is good for you can lead to
weight loss, et cetera. Led to significantly more body fat loss,
waist-to-hip ratio changes in the direction that most people would
want. But essentially a slimming down, if you will. And all sorts of
other positive effects on things like cardiovascular health. Simply by
the knowledge that movement and exercise can help various health
markers. So this is remarkable and it speaks to the power of the
nervous system and the power of belief in governing aspects of our
body and our physiology that one would otherwise think we're outside
our conscious control. Now, of course, any of you that think
scientifically which I imagine if you watch this podcast or listen to
this podcast is all of you by now probably thinking, well, maybe they
just moved around more, or maybe they stood up and sat down more,
maybe they did something else that was different. And indeed there's a
strong possibility that they did things differently than the other
group, but the mere knowledge that exercise is good for you, that
movement is good for you, shifted their behavior and their physiology
in the direction of enhanced weight loss, fat loss, et cetera. So how
we think about a given set of activities affects how we perform those
activities. And how we think about and perform those activities has a
real effect on our physiology. So somewhere between the hard and fast
rule that governs fat loss and weight loss, which is if you ingest
more calories than you burn, you'll either maintain or gain weight.
Typically, you'll gain weight, although not always. If you ingest
about as many calories as you burn, you'll maintain weight, typically.
And if you ingest fewer calories than you burn, typically you'll lose
weight. That's the kind of rule of fat loss. And yet we also have
these belief effects which show, and this has been replicated again
and again, that how we think about a process, whether or not we think
it's beneficial can change our physiology in ways that can be
beneficial to us. Somewhere in between those two extremes of hardcore
metabolic science and belief of why a bunch of protocols that are
grounded in quality peer-reviewed science and in physiology that you
can leverage to increase the rates of fat loss. And so that's what
we're going to talk about today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=1388"&gt;Our Brain Talks To Our Fat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this topic and it's not that I'm so obsessed with fat loss, but
rather the first the project I ever worked on in science was
thermogenesis and fat loss. I joined a laboratory as an undergraduate,
and the guy I worked for loved to explore new compounds and how they
impacted thermogenesis. And so we looked at how things like
MDMA/Ecstasy, how antipsychotics, antidepressants, various weight loss
drugs that were on the market. How those impacted body temperature and
fat loss and metabolism? And we just had so much fun doing it. So if
you detect a smile on my face, that's what that's about. And I also
learned a lot, and I also came to really appreciate that this tissue
of our bodies, adipose tissue and fat, we think of as just this
unfortunate thing that's like we're told it's a core energy source if
we ever entered a famine and that's all true, et cetera. You come to
realize that the cells in our body, they are there as fuel for the
furnace of our body, which is our metabolism. And there's a third
player. And that's where it really gets interesting. That the nervous
system, neurons has the opportunity to turn up the intensity of that
furnace. It has the opportunity to increase the amount of heat that we
produce and therefore the amount of energy that we burn. And I was
also really intrigued by something which is that, growing up, I think
we all know people who can eat a tone and never seem to gain any body
fat. Or people who seem to eat very little and seem to gain body fat
very easily. And I was always intrigued by that. And it turns out
there are a number of different factors that relate to that. But the
nervous system is the one that we can really control. Both through
behaviors and what we eat, but also in terms of this thing that we
call thermogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=1500"&gt;The Most Incredible &amp;amp; Dangerous Fat Loss Agent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one particular story I want to relate to, that does not
suggest any protocol. In fact, I'm going to discourage you from
following this protocol. Please do not try the compound that I'm about
to describe. One of the favorite things that we like to do in that lab
was to find rare compounds and test them. And at the time I was
reading about thermogenesis and I learned about a compound that was
actually discovered in the armory factories of World War II. And it
was discovered because women in particular who were working in these
factories would take a brush and dip it in a compound or a paint
rather, and they would then paint the numbers with a stencil onto
things like bombs and ammunition of various kinds. And they were
losing weight like crazy. It turns out that occasionally they'd lick
the brush, and then they would go back just to get a sharper point on
the brush, and then they would paint onto these various bullets and
missiles and so forth. Bombs and so forth. And they started shedding
all their body fat. And many of them losed, excuse me, lost a lot of
weight, a significant portion of their weight without changing
anything else that they were doing, what they were eating, et cetera.
It turned out that that compound is something called Dinitrophenol,
DNP. And over the years Dinatrophenol, DNP has gained popularity in
some niche cultures, mainly bodybuilders, athletes even in the
modeling industry. It is a absolutely terrible compound for anyone to
use, because it's highly fatal if your body temperature goes too high.
Hyperthermia will kill you. And indeed many people have died using
Dinatrophenol as a weight loss drug or attempting to use it as a
weight loss drug. But Dinitophenol really illustrates a principle
which is that your metabolism includes things like thyroid hormone and
growth hormone, et cetera. But your body temperature and the way you
utilize energy is controlled by your nervous system. And the way
Dinatrophenol works is by changing the neurons and the way that the
neurons that connect to fat change the way fat burns up. So we are not
going to suggest, I am not suggesting that you use Dinatrophenol.
However, there are other things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=1648"&gt;Losing Fat Is a Two-Part Process: Mobilization and Oxidation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that you can do that can change the relationship between these neurons
and the fat of your body in ways that can powerfully accelerate fat
loss. And I don't know why we don't hear about these things more, but
probably because most of what you see out there on the internet
focuses more on what you could eat and should eat or shouldn't eat. It
concentrates on exercise regimens which we will also talk about. But
the burn factor, your thermogenic environment is one of the, if not
the most important factors in this business of fat loss. And since I'm
a neuroscientist that's what we're going to talk about. So let's talk
about fat utilization. Let's talk about how fat is converted into
energy which is sometimes also called fat burning. What I'd like you
to know is that this is a two-part process. Okay? In reality, there
are many biochemical steps. And if you log onto the internet, or you
open up a textbook and you want to learn about fat utilization, you're
going to see a lot of chemistry. And I'm happy to go deep into that
chemistry if you like. But I think most of you are probably interested
in what are the leverage points? Where can you exert control over this
process in ways that benefit you? So I'm going to focus mainly on
those. Okay? This is not to upset the aficionados and I will put in
some nomenclature, but here we go. There's two parts to this process.
One, is fat mobilization. And the second is fat oxidation or
utilization. Okay? So the first thing that has to happen for body fat
to get burned up or used and reduced is that it has to get mobilized.
And that's a process called lipolysis, but I actually don't care if
you know the name lipolysis, you just have to move that fat out of the
position that it's in. You have to get it out of the fat cells. All
right? Fat cells can be visceral around our visceral organs or they
can be subcutaneous under our skin. Most people are thinking about
subcutaneous fat when they think about fat. So here's the deal. And if
you want more detail, great, I'll touch on that in a bit. But
basically stored fat has two parts that are relevant here. It's got
the fatty acid part, and that's the part that your body can use. And
that's attached to something called glycerol and they're linked by a
backbone. So already, probably too much chemistry for both of you. But
what you want is you want to break the backbone. So if you just can
remember to mobilize fat, you got to break the backbone between
glycerol and these fatty acids. Okay? That's accomplished by an enzyme
called lipase, but you can forget all that if you want. Remember,
we're just trying to mobilize fat. So the first step is to get those
fatty acids moving around in the bloodstream to get them out of those
fat cells. And then they can travel and be used for energy. And that
second part, remember first part is mobilization. The second part is
oxidation. Is then those fatty acids, those are potential fuel.
They're just potential fuel, but you haven't burned the fat yet,
you've just moved it out of your fat cells. They're going to go into
cells that can use them for energy. And once they are inside those
cells, they're still not burned up. You need to oxidize them. Think
oxidation is the burnup part. They need to be moved into the
mitochondria and then they can be converted into ATP into energy. So
just to really zoom out again to make sure I don't lose anybody. You
got to mobilize the fat, then you have to oxidize the fat. In other
words, you have to mobilize it, then you actually have to convert it
into energy. If you just mobilize it, and you don't convert it into
energy, you don't oxidize it, it can be returned to body fat. And many
of the things that the nervous system can do, is to increase the
mobilization of fat, but also the oxidation of fat. Okay? So you have
two opportunities to burn more fat, and both of those opportunities
are governed by your nervous system. By neurons that literally send
little wires that we call axons into fat and release chemicals that
provide a stimulus for more of that fat to be mobilized, and then
later for more of that fat to be burned up. Okay? So we could go
really deep on this, but I'm not going to go much deeper than that,
because this isn't a biochemistry of fatty acid metabolism lecture.
This is about how to burn fat using your nervous system. But remember,
there's a mobilization step, and then there's an oxidation step. I
think anyone of you, all of you should be able to internalize that.
Mobilize then oxidize. Okay? Mobilize then oxidize. So what are these
neurons that connect a fat doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=1945"&gt;The Critical Role of Adrenaline/Epinephrine, But NOT from Adrenal Glands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are they releasing exactly? How do they actually increase fat
mobilization? And how do they increase fat oxidation? Burning of fat.
Well, there are a couple of things that they release that encourage
that process. And the main one that you need to know about is
epinephrine or adrenaline. The conversion of these fatty acids into
ATP in the mitochondria of cells is favored by adrenaline. Okay? And
adrenaline is released from two sources. Adrenaline is released from
the adrenal glands, which set a top our kidneys and our lower back.
And it's also released from the so-called sympathetic nervous system.
Although that name is a bit of a misnomer, because it has nothing to
do with sympathy, has to do with stimulating alertness and promoting
action of the body. There's a big mistake in the literature that is
finally being corrected among those who know. The mistake in the
literature is that the adrenal glands and the release of adrenaline is
what stimulates fat loss and fat oxidation. In fact, it was thought
for a long time that adrenaline swimming around in your body of when
you're fasted, because fasting can increase adrenaline or when you're
engaging in intense exercise or when you're stressed is going to
promote fat oxidation. That's actually not the case. The adrenaline
that stimulates fat oxidation, the burning of fat is coming from
neurons that actually connect to the fat, not hormones like adrenaline
that are swimming around in your system. It's a local process. And
this is very important because it means that, what you do, the
specific patterns of movements and the specific environment you create
that can stimulate these particular neurons to activate fat, meaning
to release fat, to mobilize it and then to burn it, is going to be a
powerful lever that you can use in order to increase fat loss. So what
have we said so far? We've said that you've got to mobilize and you
got to burn fat and that your nervous system is in control of that
process. It's not just about calorie deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=2085"&gt;Fidgeting &amp;amp; Shivering: A Powerful Science-Supported Method For Fat Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so let's talk about how to activate the nervous system in ways
that it promotes more liberation, movement, mobilization of fat and
more oxidation of fat. So one of the most powerful ways to stimulate
epinephrin which is also called adrenaline from these neurons that
connect to fat and to thereby stimulate more fat mobilization and
oxidation is through movement. But I'm not talking about exercise. The
type of movement that I'm referring to, is extremely subtle. And some
of you may be familiar with this type of movement, but I'm guessing
you're probably not familiar with what I'm about to tell you, which is
that shiver or shivering is a strong stimulus for the release of
adrenaline epinephrin into fat and the increase in fat oxidation and
mobilization. But shiver is not just induced by cold, and there are
other subtle forms of movement that can greatly increase fat
metabolism and fat loss. There was a group in England during the 1960s
and 70s that discovered a pathway by which subtle forms of movement
can greatly increase fat loss. This is the work of Rothwell and Stock.
It's very famous in the thermogenesis literature. And I learned about
this early on, when I was an undergraduate and I asked, how did they
come across this? And here's how the story goes. They were aware that
some people overeat and yet don't put on weight. Other people overeat
even just a little bit and they seem to accumulate extra adipose
tissue. Now, this is long before all the discussions about microbiome
and hormone factors, you know it was long before many of the hormone
factors besides insulin had even been discovered. What they did was
they examined people who overate and did not gain weight. And what
they observed was that those people engaged in lots of subtle movement
throughout the day. In other words, they were fidgeters. And that's
what they call them. I'm not going to do the British accent version of
fidgeters. But Roth and Stock were British. What they found were
people that overeat but don't gain weight as a consequence. And in
fact, many people who had low levels of body fat had a lot of resting
tremor, not of the Parkinsonian type, but they would bounce their knee
while they were sitting, when they would talk, they would engage in
very angular movements, they were sort of electric. In fact, now in
science, I was chuckling about this as I was diving back into this
literature, because the other day I heard a wonderful lecture on a
totally different topic from a colleague of mine and we all adore him.
He's over in Europe and he's this tremendously successful scientist.
So we like to poke fun at him. And every one of his movements is
incredibly electric and staccato. And he's rail thin and he eats like
a horse. And so it fits very well into the discovery of Rothwell and
Stock who discovered that fidgeters people that bounce their knee,
people that have a head bob while they're listening, people that nod a
lot, people that stand up and sit down a lot throughout the day, and
people that pace burn anywhere from 800 to 2,500 calories more than
the control group in the experiments that they looked at. And indeed,
there's been a modern look into all this, and these numbers check out
that simply moving around a lot, even if those are subtle movements,
greatly increases the amount of energy that you burn. And people who
overeat, the people who can have the second or the third doughnut or
doughnuts at all and don't seem to put on weight to the same degree,
they are people that move around a lot even when seated. They're are
people that will often move their limbs very quickly as well. There
even have been studies that have explored other things that correlate
with fidgeters. Fidgeters stand up very quickly at the end of a
lecture or they start to gather their things very quickly, whereas non
fidgeters don't. So dogs like my bulldog Costello, definitely not a
fidgeter. Every movement is incredibly slow and deliberate. Sitting
down as a process, if you ask him to sit down and sort of a slow
motion. You ask him to get up and he kind of looks at you sighs and
stands up. The fidgeter is the opposite of that, right? You say, how
are you doing? They go, great. So even sometimes their speech will be
accelerated although not always. But staccato movements, fidgeting, et
cetera. And in 2015, and again in 2017, there've been studies that
have explored this, using some modern metabolic tracking and indeed
simply moving a lot, being a fidgeter, bouncing your knee, standing up
and pacing several times or many times throughout the day led to
considerable amounts of fat loss and weight loss when people were
ingesting the same amount of food, if they overate, they were able to
compensate and burn off that food. And if they were trying to lose
weight and they incorporated this fidgeting protocol of deliberately
trying to fidget more and move around during the day, pace, stand up
more quickly, sit down more often, sit down and stand up more often
rather. They found that they greatly increased their weight loss
anywhere from 20 to 30% increases. And in some cases, you know, there
always those few people who burned a lot more. It seems to work best
in people who are already slightly overweight. So for people that are
overweight, who are kind of averse to exercise, fidgeting might
actually be a good entry point. And 800 to 2,500 calories is a
considerable amount of calories when you really think about it. Now,
why am I telling you this? Well, there's clearly a tool to export from
this, which is that you can increase the amount of calories burned
without having to go on additional long runs. I do hope that people
are exercising regularly because it's so important for other aspects
of brain and body health. But nonetheless, we are all time limited and
we are not all so ready to embrace exercise. I have a family member
who has been slowly coaxed into exercise, but if I were to tell her,
for instance, you need to fidget more, she'd probably go for it. So
this is a powerful way to increase the calories that are burned. Now,
that's great. And you can think about the protocols. But I want to
nest that protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=2484"&gt;How Fidgeting Works: Promotes Epinephrine Release into Fat. “N-E-A-T”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in what I said before, which is that, fat is controlled by these
neurons and the epinephrin they release. You might say, well, how
could these little micro movements lead to so much caloric burn? And
that's where it really gets interesting. Rothwell and Stock and others
that they worked with, subsequently found that these little fidgety
movements, the engagement of certain aspects of our musculature that
are nothing like exercise. It's not these large coordinated or
rhythmic body movements, but rather subtle little bits of fidgety
movement. And here I am doing a lot of fidgety movement as an example,
tapping the pen, this kind of thing. I was probably that kid in class
most of the time. And I was like, I try not to do it to irritate
people, but I was definitely a knee bouncer. I'm not particularly lean
or not. But I was definitely... This is a common activity for me.
People that do that sort of thing, it turns out that it's not the kind
of caloric burn that we normally think of, of like, oh, you'll
running, lifting weights, swimming, yoga, et cetera. Those subtle
movements of our core musculature, not just the core, but all our
limbs and our musculature, those low level movements, they trigger
epinephrin release from these neurons, and they stimulate the
mobilization of fat. And then that fat is oxidized at higher rates.
And I find this fascinating. I wish more people knew about it, which
is why I'm telling you about it today. This has nothing to do with
exercise in the traditional form, and yet 800 to 2,500 calories per
day. That's a considerable amount of fat oxidized. If you are in a
calorie maintenance mode or if you're sub caloric, that's going to add
to it still additional fat loss. The data on this are tremendous. I'll
link to a few studies. If you're really interested in learning about
what's called neat. N-E-A-T which is non-exercise activity
thermogenesis. NEAT. So what's the protocol? Fidget. If you're really
interested in burning calories and you already exercise, you want to
burn more or you don't have the opportunity to exercise or you're
averse to exercise for whatever reason, fidgeting, movements, staccato
movement, standing up, walking around, pacing, all the sort of nervous
activities that were so critical of other people and sometimes in
ourselves are actually mobilizing and oxidizing a lot of fat and a lot
of energy. And while this probably won't compensate for chronic
overeating, the caloric burn from this is considerable, and very
likely can offset a meal that had excessive calories or a kind of
steady state of eating too much. And it also starts to open up all
sorts of thoughts and discussion about when you travel, you tend to
eat foods that are kind of outside your normal ones. We tend to eat
foods that aren't so great for us, we also tend to be a little bit
more sedentary when we travel we're on the plane, et cetera. But all
of that aside, just the use of something like low-level movement. And
it's almost like a tremor, but also these select short, small fidgety
movements. I'm intentionally doing a lot of these today. So you have
examples that you can use to select from if you like. These can have a
major effect on fat loss and it raises a second tool. If these low,
meaning these small movements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=2695"&gt;Two Ways of Using Shivering To Accelerate Fat Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that we engage in trigger epinephrin adrenaline release from these
neurons of the sympathetic nervous system that innervate fat and
increase fat mobilization and oxidation. Now, it should make sense why
shivering is one of the strongest stimuli that one can incorporate to
stimulate fat loss. Now, shivering is almost always associated with
cold. We think shivering, we think cold, because when we get cold, we
shiver. And there are two ways that shivering can increase fat loss.
And there are several ways that you can use shivering, you can
leverage shivering and you can leverage cold to accelerate fat loss.
But you have to do it correctly. And most of the people that are using
cold and frankly suggesting cold as a means to increase metabolism fat
loss are suggesting the exact wrong protocol. In fact, the one I'm
going to recommend is 180 degrees in the opposite direction to the
typical protocol that you'd hear about. So let's talk about how to use
cold and how to leverage shiver as a particularly strong stimulus to
increase fat loss through mobilization and oxidation of these fatty
acids. So in recent years there's been a growing interest in the use
of cold for various things like, improving stress tolerance, improving
metabolism, recovery from exercise. I've talked about a number of
those things and the uses of cold on this podcast. In fact, did an
episode on how to supercharge performance through palmer cooling,
cooling the palms in specific ways or the bottoms of the feet. And if
you're interested in that, and how to improve performance in endurance
and strength, you can check out that episode. But most people out
there are using cold exposure typically by taking cold showers or by
getting into cold water of some other kind, a lake or a river or a
cold bath or an ice bath. And they are doing that probably with mixed
goals, meaning they both would like to increase their metabolism and
burn fat, as well as improve mental resilience. Since today, we're
talking about accelerating fat loss through the use of science-based
tools. I want to emphasize a study that was published in nature just a
couple of years ago, showing exactly how cold increases metabolism and
fat loss. Okay? So we have several kinds of fat. Three kinds in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=2850"&gt;White, Brown &amp;amp; Beige Fat; &amp;amp; Using Cold-Induced Shiver To Burn Fat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have white fat, white adipose tissue, and we have brown fat or
brown adipose tissue. And there's a third kind which is beige adipose
tissue. White fat is the type that we traditionally think of as fat,
subcutaneous fat. And it is not particularly rich in mitochondria. It
is there as an energy storage site and we have to mobilize the fat out
as we talked about before and burn it up elsewhere. Brown fat largely
exists between our shoulder blades and on the back of our neck,
between the scapulae. And it's rich with mitochondria which is why
it's called brown fat. And brown fat has a particular biochemical
cascade whereby it can take food energy, it can take food, basically,
break it down and convert it into energy within those cells. And
there's some additional steps involved, but unlike fatty acids from
white fat which have to travel elsewhere get broken down in
mitochondria and convert into ATP, et cetera. Used by the mitochondria
rather. Brown fat is thermogenic. It can actually use energy directly.
It skips a step, and I don't want to get diverted by going into all
the biochemistry of it. Beige fat is sort of in between. It's white
fat that could be brown fat, because it has some mitochondria in it,
but not as many as brown fat. Now, cold exposure does several things.
Making ourselves cold can allow us to build up mental resilience
because getting into cold of any kind, doesn't matter if it's a
cryochamber, doesn't matter if it's a cold day and you forgot your
sweater or your parka. It doesn't matter if it's an ice bath or you're
lying down in the snow. Cold causes the release of adrenaline from
your adrenals. And it causes the release of epinephrin from these
neurons that connect to fat. Now, the big effects of cold on
metabolism and fat burning are going to be through two routes. One, is
that if you expose yourself to cold, you have the opportunity to
trigger activation of brown fat as well as to convert more beige fat
into true brown fat. So you essentially create a stronger or a hotter
furnace. That's the way to think about brown fat. It's like a furnace.
And so with this principle that we started with a calories in versus
calories burned. What you're doing is you're increasing the amount of
burning, you're increasing the burn of energy by increasing the
intensity of the heat inside you so to speak. Okay? I'm talking here
kind of metaphorically. Now, how can you do that? Well, if you get
into cold water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3025"&gt;How To Use Cold Properly To Stimulate Fat Loss: Succinate Release Is Key/Shiver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or an ice bath or a cold day, and you try and remain calm and resist
shivering, you actually short circuit this mechanism for increasing
brown fat thermogenesis. The paper published in nature shows that it
is shivering itself that causes the brown fat to increase your
burning, your burn rate and your metabolism. And it works like this,
when you get into cold and you shiver, the shivering that low level
movement of the muscle, those small movements triggers the release of
a molecule called succinate. S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate. And
succinate acts on the brown fat to increase brown fat thermogenesis
and fat burning overall. It actually increases body heat through this
brown fat thermogenesis pathway. And it also over time can increase
the amount of brown fat by converting beige fat into true brown fat.
Now, how much cold exposure and how often? That's the key. But before
I give that detail or set of details. Remember if you resist the
shiver, you are not going to get the increased metabolic effect,
because you are not going to get the succinate release. So if you want
to get your body heat, your thermogenic level to go up, you need to
shiver. So now we have the NEAT, the non-exercise activity
thermogenesis. So low levels of activity as I described before, which
are done away from cold, maybe do them in cold as well. As well as
shiver in response to cold. And so the shiver itself is valuable for
triggering the release of succinate. In fact, succinate is being
evolved now by various drug manufacturers as a potential treatment for
obesity. Although it hasn't really hit the market in its final form
yet. Succinate is powerful for its effects on brown fat. So how many
times a week do you need to expose yourself to cold?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3146"&gt;Exact Protocols: (1-5X per week); Don’t Adapt! Submerge and Exit “Sets &amp;amp; Reps”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will depend on how much fat you're trying to lose, and how much you're
trying to increase your metabolism. There are studies that describe
positive effects on fat loss of exposing yourself to cold, either
through cold shower or through ice bath or other cold water. It
doesn't have to actually have ice in it, provided it's cold enough for
anytime, anywhere, excuse me, between one and five times per week. But
it turns out that just one exposure per week can be valuable. The
question then is how long to get into that cold environment? And how
cold should that environment be? So first let's talk about how long to
get into that cold environment? The answer here might be a little bit
different than you might imagine. Most of you might think, oh, well if
one minute is good, three minutes is better, and if three minutes is
better than 10 minutes is best. But remember the goal is to get the
shiver induced release of succinate, so that succinate can trigger the
brown fat. It turns out that if you want to trigger the shiver, what
you want to do is to get into the cold and then get out of the cold
and typically not dry off, and then get back into the cold and out of
the cold, that will definitely stimulate more shivering than just
getting into the cold itself. So what I'm not referring to, is getting
into the cold environment like an ice bath and waiting until you
shiver and staying there shivering. Okay? You also don't want to get
hypothermic. And I want to be clear. You want to get approval from
your doctor before you do any of this. When you get into cold water,
there are two factors that will dictate whether or not you shiver.
Probably three, but let's just talk about the main two. One, is how
cold it is. So how cold should it be? And look, if you get into water,
that's very, very cold. It can actually shock your heart. It can
actually give you a heart attack if it's truly, truly ice cold, and
you're not adapted to that. So proceed with caution, please. I'm not a
physician and I don't want to see anyone get hurt. Just cold enough to
be uncomfortable is a good place to start. So for some of you that's
going to be 60 degrees, for some of you that's going to be 55 degrees,
for some of you it's going to be high thirties, right? Depends on how
cold adapted you are, and people vary in terms of how well they
tolerate the cold. So what you need to do is find a temperature that
you can get into one to five, probably one to three times a week. If
you really want this to accelerate fat loss. And you want to get in
until you just start to shiver, and then you want to get out and not
dry off, wait anywhere from one to three minutes and then get back
into the cold. Now, you'll notice when you get back into the cold,
it'll almost seem soothing, it might actually not induce shiv... It
might take away the shiver that you had. So here's a potential kind of
sets reps protocol that you can play with. Find a temperature then
induce a shiver for you. That's going to vary depending on your cold
tolerance and how cold adapted you are. One to three, maybe five times
a week, get in until you... Or get under the shower or whatever it is,
until you start to shiver. Genuinely shiver. Then after about a minute
or so, get out, spend one to three minutes out, but don't dry off, get
back in for anywhere from one to three minutes, but try and access the
shiver point again. And you might do three repetitions of that. So
it's three times in and three times out total. Okay? That's a great
starting place. And what you don't want to do is build up your
tolerance to cold so fast, that pretty soon you're able to resist the
shiver, because remember the shiver is the source of the succinate
release that will trigger brown fat thermogenesis. So if you'd like to
see this protocol spelled out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3375"&gt;thecoldplunge.com see “protocols” tab Cold-Shiver-Fat-Loss Tool (cost free)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can access it zero cost at a website which is
www.thecoldplunge.com. The Cold Plunge is a company they make cold
plunges, and they were kind enough to gift one to the Human Lab
Podcast. But I want to emphasize that these protocols are free of
cost. The folks at the Cold Plunge are not just interested in
marketing their product, but one of their main interests is
encouraging people to engage in cold exposure for particular end
points and goals like fat loss, resilience, et cetera. Resisting
inflammation. But their main focus is providing people protocols and
encouraging people to use cold exposure of various kinds not just
through their products, but through cold rivers and jumps in the ocean
and things like cold showers, whatever is most convenient and
accessible for various people. And so we needed a place where we could
house these protocols in a permanent way, and not just for this
episode. But so what they've agreed to do is, to post the protocols
there, they should be very easy to find on their website. This
particular protocol we're referring to as the fat loss optimization
protocol for lack of a better name. And it's really grounded in how
cold it can be used to induce shiver. And again, it doesn't really
matter how you're accessing that cold, provided you access to the
shiver, and you're moving from the cold environment to a slightly
warmer environment. So getting out of the cold shower or getting out
of the ice bath, et cetera, or out of the cold plunge, and then back
in. Because it turns out that the cooling and rewarming process of the
body is where shiver kicks in. And so that's distinctly different than
just trying to get into the cold and stay in the cold for as long as
possible. And if you zoom out a little bit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3483"&gt;If Fat-Loss Is Your Goal, Avoid Cold Adaptation: Remember Polar Bear Swimmers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and think about some examples in life, you'll understand why that must
be the case. For instance, people who do a lot of cold water swims,
you have these polar bear clubs, I think they call themselves. They do
these cold water swims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3497"&gt;Irisin: Underwhelming; Succinate Is The Real Deal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would sometimes see these people swimming back and forth to Alcatraz
and stuff like that, which it seems risky. and they tell me it's very
stimulating for the mind and body. Great. Sometimes those people are
very lean, oftentimes they're not, and they're getting a lot of cold
exposure. And one of the things that happens is, if you expose
yourself to cold over and over, you adapt, you become cold adapted.
And when you do that, you no longer get the epinephrine, the
adrenaline release from the cold and therefore you don't get the
succinate release and the shivering and the brown fat thermogenic
effect quite as intensely. So if you want to use cold for other
reasons, and certainly cold water swims can be fun. And there's, you
know, long as you can do them safely, they're great. I've gotten into
cold water swimming for some period of time. You can use cold for
resilience, et cetera. But if you want to use cold to increase fat
loss, then getting this shiver process going the cooling and rewarming
which accelerates the amount of, or increases the amount of shiver.
That's going to be the way to go. One note about cold and some of the
factors that it releases. A few years back there was a lot of
excitement about this hormone called irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N, which was
associated with cold. And there was a lot of excitement about its
potential role in increasing metabolism so much so that people were
starting to explore this as a potential fat loss drug. To my knowledge
that went nowhere. The science eventually shifted over to succinate as
the main factor in cold induced thermogenesis through this brown fat
pathway. But if anyone out there is aware of any positive effects of
iricin or of any signs of irisin that I'm overlooking here, or that
I'm speaking about incorrectly, please let me know. I'd be very
curious to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3600"&gt;Brown Fat, Why Babies Can’t Shiver and Becoming a Hotter Furnace, Adding Heat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I want to just talk about brown fat a little bit more, and talk
about a period in your life in which you were rich with brown fat, you
had a ton of brown fat, and that's when you were a baby. Babies can't
shiver. These neurons that release epinephrin into fat are not wired
up and really aren't present at sufficient levels or in sufficient
numbers when you are a baby. And therefore you can't shiver as a baby,
and you can't warm yourself up in cold environments very well. To
compensate for that, mother nature installed in all of us an excess of
brown fat early in life that exists again in the upper back, and the
middle of the back and the back of the neck. Over time if we don't
expose ourselves to cold environments or do other things that make a
shiver, we lose a lot of that brown fat, but what's interesting about
brown fat is that there's some evidence that brown fat just like white
fat can both increase in size, but that you can also add new cells.
Now, there's a little bit controversial. People always say you can't
change the number of fat cells, you can just shrink them or increase
their size. Well, it turns out that epinephrin released from these
little nerve endings in brown fat and succinate circulating in the
body may and I want to underscore may have the effect of increasing
the amount of brown fat cells probably by converting these beige fat
cells into brown fat. So that allows us to become much as we were
early in life, where we metabolized like crazy and we'd heat ourselves
up without shivering. Some people have taken the cold thing to the
extreme, putting ice packs on the back of their neck throughout the
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3715"&gt;Ice On Back of The Neck, Cold Underpants: Not A Great Idea For Fat Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did a episode all about testosterone and estrogen, and there's this,
let's just call it a very niche, I have to imagine very, very niche
culture of people who are wearing literally, I'm not joking. They are
these cool pack ice pack underpants. They go by a name that I'm not
going to repeat on here, but you can find them on Amazon. Those are
people that are using cold packs on the body and on the groin to try
and increase things like testosterone. But as well to try and increase
thermogenesis and trying to increase their metabolism. Just remember
if you become cold adapted, you're not going to get the fat burning
effects to the same degree. So cold is a powerful tool for fat loss,
but you don't want to adapt. This is reminiscent of a rule that you
hear about in endurance exercise and in strength exercise as well,
which is, that you want to use the minimal effective stimulus to
promote growth or progress. So growth of a muscle or improvements in
endurance. If you go 10% further on a run or 10% faster, you will
likely see an improvement in performance provided your recovery the
next time you come back and do that same round of exercise. You'll be
able to do more work or complete the work more easily, et cetera.
You've adapted. If you do 20% more distance or 20% more weight, you
won't necessarily see the same commiserate level of gain or
improvement. And so likewise with cold, if you're quickly moving from
30 seconds of exposure to 10 minutes of exposure, you're overlooking
the opportunity to get the most fat loss and increase in metabolism by
stepping it up in smaller increments. Okay? And this also speaks to
the rationale for using cold exposure to accelerate fat loss for
certain periods, but then maybe not doing it year round. If fat loss
is your goal, maybe use it for two, three months at a time and then
stop for two, three months at a time, because it is such a potent
stimulus provided you engage in the shiver. Next I'd like to move to
exercise and how particular timing and types of exercise can vastly
improve fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3840"&gt;A Key Paper For the Aficionados: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826518&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I do that, I just want to mention a really important reference
for those of you that are interested in learning more about how
neurons connect to fat? This is certainly a paper that you'd want to
look at, if you're interested in diving deep into the literature and
reading all the various studies. It's a review. And the title of the
review is neural innervation of white adipose tissue and the control
of lipolysis. That's neural innervation of white adipose tissue and
the control of lipolysis. It was published in Frontiers in
Neuroendocrinology. You can find that free online. They have the full
text available. The first author is Bartness, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S. It's a
great review. And I've talked about a number of things that are
mentioned in the review. Follow the references in that review and the
reference trail as we say, if you're interested in learning more about
also how neurons control brown fat. And before I moved to exercise, I
also just want to highlight something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=3900"&gt;Spot Reduction: There May Be Hope After All. Targeting Specific Fat Pads.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that comes up every few years and has largely been considered myth
now, but that is actually more interesting than most people might
think, which is this issue of spot reduction. You know, in the 80s and
90s, there were a lot of commercials, late night infomercials, where
they would talk about spot reduction. If you do sit ups, will you lose
abdominal fat? If you do hip raises or glute raises, will you lose
gluten hip fat. And I think everybody knows now believes that, and
understands that fat metabolism is something that happens systemically
throughout the body. That some body fat is quote unquote more stubborn
than others. Everyone varies in where they tend to store fat or lose
fat last. Number of factors that influence that, and in particular
hormone receptors. But now at least in the scientific literature, spot
reduction and the possibility of real true spot reduction reductions
in fat in a targeted way, a body part or body area targeted way is
becoming more of a reality and may be a reality soon, because exercise
that triggers the activation of these nerve fibers, these neurons that
innervate fat. In theory, if you can increase the amount of epinephrin
released at those particular fat pads as they're called, they're
actually called fat pads in the scientific literature. In theory, you
could increase mobilization from those particular body fat sites.
Okay? So because the new view that the modern understanding is that
it's not adrenaline released systemically kind of bathing all your fat
tissue, but rather its neurons releasing adrenaline epinephrin locally
that in theory, exercise that stimulates the release of epinephrin or
exercise coupled with things like shiver or low grade shaking
movement, or the NEAT, the non-exercise activity thermogenesis could
in theory lead to local enhancement of mobilization of fat tissue. So
I think that spot reduction actually will soon be something that's
possible using the appropriate technology. What does this mean for you
now? What could you possibly do with this information now? Well, I
think it speaks to the fact that if one is going to engage in exercise
that doing exercises that involve lots of different body parts and
movements is likely to encourage the maintenance and or growth of
these neurons that innervate fat throughout the body. What this means
is changing up the pattern of exercise, engaging in novel types of
movements may actually be one way that one can access these so-called
stubborn body fat pads. Now, there's a little bit of speculation in
the statement that I'm making, but if you think about it it makes
sense. If you become very adapted to a particular pattern of exercise,
whether or not you're subcaloric or not, you're on maintenance
calories are not, you are oxidizing some fat always, and you're
utilizing the neurons that innervate fat in a regular way. And pretty
soon this innervation is going to shut off, because there's no reason
why this neural innervation of fat should continue to release
epinephrin unless you give it a strong stimulus like cold or the
fidgeting or in this case to do novel forms of exercise. And there's
some anecdotal evidence and I don't even want to call it data, but
anecdotal evidence that people who have, quote on quote stubborn body
fat, if they start to adopt new patterns of exercise, they can start
to access those stubborn fat pads. And again, fat pads is the correct
way to refer to these in the scientific literature. So what we're
focusing on today is the fact that fat indeed will be mobilized and
oxidized in response to a deficit in calories. But that the way that
neurons control those fat pads and those body fat stores, affords you
a lot more control than perhaps you ever previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=4160"&gt;Exercising For Fat Loss: What Is Best? High Intensity, Sprinting, Moderate Intensity?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about movement. And the more traditional kinds of
movement, aka exercise has been shown to lead to increases in
metabolism and fat loss to greater degrees depending on whether or not
for, instance you're fasted when you do it or not, whether or not you
do your cardio first or your resistance training first. And this is
again in the literature for which there's a lot of controversy, but in
digging through all the studies on this, we're finally starting to
arrive at a consensus of, when is best to do exercise? And what types
of exercise to do if your goal is fat loss? The topic of exercise is a
kind of controversial one, not as controversial as nutrition and diet
which we will talk about in a few minutes. But it's a particularly
interesting one, because different types of exercising gauge the
musculature of the body and the heart and the lungs in different ways,
and can have vastly different effects on things like hormones and
metabolism depending on whether or not it's of high intensity,
moderate intensity or low intensity. So rather than think about weight
training versus cardiovascular exercise, I think the most simple way,
the most fluid way to have this conversation about exercise and fat
loss is in terms of three general types of training. Whether or not
it's done with weights or body weight doesn't really matter. And those
are high intensity interval training. Something that's seems to have
gained a lot of popularity in recent years. So-called HITT, H-I-I-T.
So high intensity interval training. Sprint interval training. So
that's going to be very high intensity or SIT, or moderate intensity
continuous training, M-I-C-T. So we've got HIIT, SIT and MICT, M-I-
C-T. And we can get a little bit more precise if you'd like. I'm not
somebody who measures my VO2 max or anything while I exercise. I
generally know whether or not I'm doing something I could continue for
a very long time, or whether or not I'm doing something that I realize
is going to be of short duration high-intensity. But if you'd like to
map this to VO2 max SIT, this sprint interval training was defined as
all out greater than 100% of VO2 max bursts of activity that lasts
eight to 30 seconds intersperse with less intense recovery periods. So
this would be sprinting downfield for eight to 30 seconds, then maybe
walking back for about a minute or two and then sprinting again and
then continuing. So that would be SIT. HIIT, H-I-I-T is defined as
submaximal, so 80 to a hundred percent of VO2 max bursts of activity
that lasts 60 to 240 seconds intersperse with less intense recovery
periods. So on a standard 400 meter track, just to give this a little
bit of a visual, a four minute mile would be fantastic for most
people, although people run faster than that of course. So that's four
60 seconds laps, but that's back to back to back. I think in my best
shape or maybe it was in my dreams, I don't recall which I was able to
do 60 seconds around the track, but of course I couldn't get that on
the second or third or fourth if I did that was certainly in the
fantasy land and not reality. But 60 seconds would be about one
revolution around the track, maybe 90 seconds, depending on how fast a
one is running. So 60 to 240 seconds. MICT okay. This moderate
intensity continuous training is steady state cardio sometimes called
Zone 2 cardio these days on the internet, which has performed
continuously for 20 to 60 minutes at moderate intensity of 40 to 60%
of VO2 max or if you prefer heart rate 55 to 70% of max heart rate.
Okay? So we can think about high, medium and low intensity exercise.
Although low intensity usually means that you could carry on a
conversation, or maybe you have to gasp every few steps or so, while
trying to talk and run. That's I think going to be the most useful way
to have this conversation that we're having now, because there's so
many different forms of exercise that people do and intensity is
important. Let's ask the question that I think many people are
wondering about, which is, is it better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=4410"&gt;Exercising Fasted: Does It Truly Accelerate Fat Loss/Oxidation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning do you burn more fat if you do your exercise fasted? And
fasted in this respect could be that you wake up in the morning,
you've been fasting all night, you just hydrate and you exercise or
sometimes people will ingest caffeine, there's controversy as to
whether or not that quote on quote breaks the fast. It has to do with
whether or not your caffeine adapted something for another episode. In
any case that would be fasted. So probably not having eaten anything
for anywhere from three to 24 hours or maybe even more. As you could
also be fasted in the afternoon. If you had lunch at noon and it's
four or five or 6:00 p.m. Is it, will you burn more fat if you
exercise without an eating anything first, without ingesting any
calories first? And people have tried to really split hairs on this,
every which way people say, well, you can fat fast, because fat and
protein doesn't lead to as great increases in insulin as other things,
maybe you can have a few almonds and then still train. And indeed
insulin will prevent fat oxidation. I want to be really clear. The
burning part of fat in the cell, the movement of the fatty acid and
into mitochondria and the conversion ATP, insulin inhibits that
process. However, it's been shown that it least for short periods of
training, it doesn't really seem to matter whether or not you eat
before training or you don't, if your goal is fat oxidation. Now, I
want to put an asterix near that, because there are some exceptions.
But there were several studies done that, and the kind of the classic
ones of these, I'll read out to you. What they basically did is they
gave people glucose, sugar, to increase their blood sugar before
training or not. And the kind of classic study of this is Al Borg at
all. So in 1976, so it goes way back, which is that glucose reduces
fat burning and exercise. And then some other studies if you want to
look these up, they're very easy to find on PubMed. You put in
Horowitz 1999, [indistinct] is another one where they have people
drink milk with glucose in it. So sweet sugary milk before exercise,
et cetera. And you can find a number of examples where eating before
exercise reduces the amount of fat that's oxidized during the
exercise. And you can also find a lot of studies showing that, eating
during exercise or prior to exercise will not reduce the amount of fat
that is oxidized. However, the types of exercise whether I was medium
intensity or high intensity or low intensity is all over the map for
these studies. So it's very hard to target an ideal protocol. And then
if you look really deep in the literature, you start to find meta
analysis where people have actually aggregated all the findings and
some modern studies where it points to some very specific and useful
protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=4590"&gt;The 90 Minute Rule: After 90 Minutes, The Fasted Exercisers Start To Burn More Fat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so here's the rule that or the protocol that I extracted from that
literature. At a period of about 90 minutes of moderate intensity
exercise, I want to be clear, at about or after 90 minutes of moderate
intensity exercise. There's a switchover point whereby if you ate
before the exercise, you will reduce, excuse me, you will burn far
less fat from the 90 minute point onward than you would if you had
gone into the training fasted. So let me repeat that. If it's moderate
intensity, so-called zone two cardio type exercise, at the 90 minute
point, if you happen to have eaten before the exercise within one to
three hours prior to the exercise, then you reduce the amount of fat
that you will burn from 90 minutes onward, whereas if you had fasted
prior to the exercise, you hadn't eaten anything for three hours or
more prior to the exercise. At the 90 minute point, 90 minutes of
exercise you will start to burn more fat than you would had you eaten.
Now, 90 minutes of moderate intensity exercises is a lot. So that's a
pretty long run. Even if you're running at a pretty slow pace like a
10 or 12 minute mile, that's a lot of running, that's a lot of
swimming. So that's a lot of walking, that's a lot of hiking. However,
there are people who are going out hiking all day or running all day
or walking all day. And if you want to burn more fat per unit time,
you want to oxidize more fat then you would do that fasted. Now, there
are also studies that pointed the fact that you don't have to wait to
90 minutes in order to get this enhanced fat burning effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=4695"&gt;If High-Intensity Training Is Done First, The Benefits of Fasting Arrive Before 90min.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies I was able to find and that looked to me like quality
peer-reviewed studies with no company bias or no product bias of any
kind. These are studies that were largely funded by the federal
government in the university context pointed the fact that if one does
high-intensity training, or even the very high intensity forms of
training like sprints or squats or deadlifts or any kind of activity
that can't be maintained for more than these, you know, eight or I
would say up to 60 seconds. So a set of lifting weights repeated,
repeated, if that's done for anywhere from 20 minutes, so weight
training or power lifting or these kinds of things or kettlebell
swings or up to 60 minutes, we'll then the switchover point in which
you can burn more fat, if you go into that fasted comes earlier. And
this makes sense because there's nothing holy about the 90 minute
point for a medium intensity Zone 2 cardio. That 90 minute point is
the point in which the body shifts over from mainly burning glycogen,
basically, sugar that comes from muscles or the liver and realizes
this is going on for a while, I'm going to shift over to a storage
site fuel that is in reserve like body fat. This is going to happen
for a while, so I'm going to start tapping into body fat stores. Now,
fat doesn't have a little brain there. It is innervated by neurons,
but it doesn't have thoughts. And you don't actually control this
switch with your mind. This is something that has to do with the
milieu of various hormones. What has to happen is insulin has to go
down far enough. So if you ate before the exercise, you'd have an
increase in insulin, if you ate carbohydrates you'd have a bigger
increase in insulin, fat and proteins indeed you'll have lower amounts
of insulin and fasting will give you the lowest amount of insulin.
Well, then that switch over point is going to come earlier in the
exercise. And if you think about if you were to do something high
intensity for 20, 30, 40 minutes, so maybe lift weights and then get
into Zone 2 cardio. If you are fasted, the literature says that you're
going to burn more body fat per unit time than if you had eaten before
or during the exercise. So what does this mean? This means if you want
to burn more body fat, if it's in your protocols and you have been
approved to do this safely, exercise intensely for 20 to 60 minutes,
the higher the intensity obviously the shorter that about is going to
be, and then move over into Zone 2 cardio. And if you do that fasted
or the medium intensity cardio I should say. And if you do that
fasted, then indeed you will burn a higher percentage of body fat. If
you need to eat or you like to eat before you train that also can
work. And if you train very intensely, you're likely to shift over to
the fat burning pattern more quickly as well. So again, this isn't
really an issue of how long you exercise. It's an issue of how
intensely you exercise and therefore what fuel source you're drawing
from. So hopefully I've made that clear, but basically you need to
deplete glycogen or through high intensity exercise and then move to a
steady state exercise that will allow you to burn more fat. Or you
need to perform a medium intensity or low intensity type exercise for
a long period of time before you shift over to burning fat. And indeed
it seems that going into all that fasted will facilitate the burning
of more fat overall. But if you can't even get to the exercise, if
you're somebody who just can't do the training at all, you're
unwilling to or you're incapable of training, unless you eat
something, then obviously eating something makes the most sense. And
what you eat prior to exercise, that's a whole other biz that people
argue about and fight about whether or not you should go into it with
low carbohydrates or higher carbs, all of that. But in general, the
theme there is very simple. Which is that you want insulin levels to
be pretty low if your goal is body fat reduction, if you want to
oxidize body fat. So fasting in some cases, fat fasting and other
cases where you're just ingesting fats. Fat and protein, in some cases
or for some people it will be eating carbohydrates. I'm not here to
dictate a particular nutrition regimen. That's just how the hormone
balance of these things and fat oxidation works. Now, one thing that's
very interesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=4964"&gt;Post-Exercise Metabolic Increases: How To Bias This Toward Fat Oxidation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and cannot be overlooked is this issue of how much energy you burn
during and after the activity. And some of you probably already know
about this, but the whole business of calories in versus calories out,
and people counting the number of calories they burn during their
aerobic session or during their whatever session is only one half of
the equation and it really eclipses the more important issue, which is
how much of an increase in metabolism does a given exercise create
after the exercise? And we could talk for hours about this, but the
simple way to view this is that, high intensity training, anaerobic
training of weight training, sprints, burpees, any kind of thing. I
don't know these days I hear that you're not supposed to do burpees
that people think burpees are dangerous. So I'm not suggesting any
particular movements here. You have to decide what's right for you. I
do burpees. I don't seem to be injured from them, but I hear that
they're terrible for some people. So anyway, push-ups, sit-ups,
whatever it happens to be that anaerobic exercise that's of higher
intensity or sprints taps into glycogen stores during the movement and
we'll burn more energy per unit time than moderate intensity. High
intensity burns more than modern intensity. That's straightforward.
What's interesting is that all the studies that I was able to find on
what happens after that type of exercise showed that the percentage of
fat that you burn after high intensity exercise is actually greater.
In other words, you burn a lot of glycogen during the high intensity
exercise. And then after the exercise, the post exercise oxygen
consumption as it sometimes called goes up. We know this after you
train intensely that post exercise oxygen consumption goes up
sometimes for up to 24 hours. And it is during that period of time
that you oxidize more fat not glycogen. Now, what's interesting is
that the reverse is also true, for people that do long bouts of low or
moderate intensity exercise. So typically this would be things like
running, swimming, biking, et cetera. So 60, 90 minutes, two hours
maybe even people that are training for marathons or half marathons,
when they stop training, they burn more glycogen, more carbohydrate,
even though they were burning more body fat per unit time during the
low intensity exercise. So there's this kind of inversion. High-
intensity burns more glycogen during the activity, more body fat
afterwards. Moderate to low intensity burns more percentage-wise more
body fat is oxidized than glycogen during the actual exercise
afterward it's more glycogen. So I don't want this to get too
complicated. The point is you should pick exercise that you like, that
you're going to do regularly, but it does seem that the high intensity
exercise followed by moderate intensity exercise is going to be
optimal for fat burning overall. Because when you look at the
percentage of body fat burned, and you look at the overall increase in
basal metabolic rate, moderate and high intensity training followed by
low intensity training or even just followed by going back into life
is going to be the best way to continue to burn body fat because of
the ways that it increases basal metabolic rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=5165"&gt;A Protocol For Exercise-Induced Fat Loss; Adrenalin Is The Effector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be distilled into a simple protocol whereby three or four
times a week you do high intensity training followed by either nothing
or followed by low intensity training especially if you're able to do
that fasted. And I should just mention that none of this stuff about
fasted is about performance. If you want to perform really well, this
is for reasons of performance and you want to, you know, it's for a
sport or a competition, it's not for body fat purposes. Well, then all
of this kind of falls away and is modified by what's ideal to eat for
performance. But what we're talking about today is how to optimize
body fat loss. So train moderately to very high intensity and then
moderate to low intensity, or train moderate to high intensity, and
then go about life. And in fact, I have a friend who uses this
strategy. He likes the train intensely and not that often protocol
cause he's a very busy person. So he'll train for 20 or 30 minutes
intensely with weights or just body weight movement doing a lot, he
does burpees and push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups and just kind of
moving and kind of circuit type training. But where he's breathing
really hard, the goal he always says is, I want to breathe hard for 30
minutes every day. And then afterwards he hydrates and drinks coffee
and moves into his day. And he's walking around and taking calls and
carrying around his children and doing all these kinds of things that
keep him really busy which is kind of like low intensity work. So I
think you get the principle now. But you should all be asking
yourselves as scientists of yourselves. Why would it be that certain
patterns of exercise would lead to more or less fat loss? I mean, it
can't just be about the energy burn. We already established that. And
again, it has to do with the neurons. It has to do with how we engage
the nervous system. So while non-exercise activity induced
thermogenesis, NEAT, the fidgeting and cold can induce thermogenesis
by engaging shiver tight movement or low-level movements. Big
movements that are of very high intensity, meaning they require a lot
of effort, deploy a lot of adrenaline epinephrin from our neurons and
signal particular types and amounts of fat thermogenesis, fat
oxidation, whereas low level intensity exercise, low or moderate
intensity exercise, walking, running, biking where you can do that
easily, there's not very much adrenaline release. So adrenaline aka
epinephrin is really the final common path by which movement of any
kind, whether or not it's low level shiver, whether or not it's
lifting a barbell sprinting up a hill or doing a long bike ride.
Adrenaline is the effector of fat loss. It's the trigger end, it's the
effector. So now I want to turn our attention to compounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=5330"&gt;Supplements/Compounds For Fat Loss Part: Caffeine Fidgeting, &amp;amp; Caffeine Adaptation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that increase epinephrin and adrenaline, as well as compounds that
work outside the adrenaline epinephrin pathway to increase the rates
of fat loss. I almost always save compounds and supplements and things
of that sort to the end, because I do believe that people should look
first towards behavioral tools and an understanding of the science
before they look toward a supplement or a particular thing that they
can extract from diet. This is mainly to try and shift people away
from the kind of magic pill phenomenon or the idea that there is a
magic pill because there really isn't. And frankly, there never will
be. But there are some compounds that can greatly increase fat
oxidation and mobilization. And understanding which compounds increase
oxidation or mobilization can be very useful if your goal is to
accelerate fat loss. There are things that people can ingest that will
allow them to oxidize more fat. And that occurs mainly by increasing
the amount of epinephrin that is released from neurons that innovate
fat tissue. One of the more common ones is one that you may already be
using which is caffeine. It's well-established that caffeine can
enhance performance, if you're caffeine adapted. I talked about this
in an earlier episode so I want to make sure I'm very clear about
this. If you are not used to drinking caffeine and you suddenly decide
I'm going to drink a big cup of coffee before training, you will
vasoconstrict and you will limit performance. So that's performance.
If you're caffeine adapted however, there's this kind of interesting
phenomenon where ingestion of caffeine serves more as a performance
enhancer, both by increasing alertness, but also by way of dilating
vasculature of allowing more blood flow. Now, caffeine for burning
more fat for oxidizing and mobilizing more fat is an interesting one.
It can be effective at dosages up to 400 milligrams. You have to be
careful if you're caffeine sensitive. Some people have just the
littlest bit of caffeine and their mind goes crazy, and they're very
uncomfortable. It can have cardiovascular effects for some people or
hypertension, et cetera. So please check with your doctor. But 400
milligrams is roughly a cup and a half a coffee or two cups of coffee.
Nowadays, there's a lot more caffeine in coffee. So if you go to a
typical cafe and you were to get their medium-sized that would have
close to a gram of caffeine, which is why, if you're a regular
caffeine consumer and you don't get that gram of caffeine in your
coffee each day, you will get a headache. It can cause constriction
and dilation of blood vessels in ways that's complicated, but you'll
get a headache. Some people like the way they feel drinking 100 to
200, 300 maybe 400 milligrams of caffeine before training. And indeed
that will lead to increase fat oxidation. It will do that because you
will release more epinephrin and adrenaline. So let's just place this
in the context of what we said previously. Let's say you normally do
Zone 2 cardio, so you're going out for a moderately intense run for 30
to 60 minutes or so. I think the current recommendation guidelines in
the States are that people engage in 30 minutes of moderate intensity
exercise five days a week for that's 150 minutes. If their goal is to
improve or maintain health of the cardiovascular system. 80% of people
in the United States fail to do that, or anything close to it. We are
way below threshold for what the government has recommended. In this
case, the government recommendations, I think are pretty good. That's
one could always do better of course. But 80% of people aren't even
doing that. However, just using the logic and the understanding of how
epinephrin adrenaline is affecting this fat oxidation process. If you
were to go out for 15 minutes and you drank caffeine before you went,
yes, you'll probably oxidize more fat per unit time. Can you
compensate for the exercise you're not doing just by drinking
caffeine? Well, probably if you were just talking about fat loss, if
that caffeine makes you fidget a lot, right? The amount of calories
that you burn in a 30 minute run, unless the run is very intense and
you're wearing a weight vest and it's up a hill, it's not that great,
right? Then you probably get you in somewhere into the 400, 500
calories burned area. But I said earlier, and there are a lot of data
now to support that fidgeting for a day can burn anywhere from 800 to
2,500 calories a day. So you might say, well, fidgeting is better than
running, ah, but it doesn't trigger the activation and the positive
health effects of the cardiovascular system. So fidgeting alone can be
great, but you need exercise for other reasons. Caffeine can enhance
the amount of fat that you burn in any duration of exercise. And it
can shift the percentage of fat that you oxidize compared to glycogen.
Unless you take that caffeine and it ramps you up so much that you're
training really, really intensely. The bottom line is, if you like
caffeine and you can use it safely, ingesting somewhere between 104
milligrams of caffeine prior to exercise somewhere between 30 to 40
minutes before exercise can be beneficial if we're talking about fat
oxidation burning more body fat. So that's caffeine. There are a
number of other things that have existed over the years that are in
this pathway, things like ephedrine which is now illegal in most
states, I think maybe an all states because people were dropping dead
from taking ephedrine, because they were heating up too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=5670"&gt;Ephedrine, Fenfluramine: Removed From Market Due to Safety Concerns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting it wasn't direct effects on the heart causing heart
attack. It could trigger by way of adrenergic receptors. If you'd like
to know, increases in body temperature and heat. Now, those drugs
turned out to be dangerous, because people were overheating and dying.
There was also the big Fen-Phen craze. That was a drug that was
released fenfluramine which actually was quite effective as an anti
obesity drug, a treatment for obesity that had to be outlawed as well.
It was FDA approval was removed because again people were dying
because of cardiovascular effects. I don't know if people were
overheating on it as well. So what is the solution? If caffeine is the
kind of the entry point for most people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=5722"&gt;GLP1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide 1), Yerba Mate, Guayusa Tea, Semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of using compounds to increase the rate or percentage of fat loss in
exercise and even at rest, what are some of the other things that are
useful and interesting? Well, in terms of tools that are actionable
and have reasonable safety margins, I've talked before about something
called GLP-1. This is something that can be triggered by the ingestion
of yerba mate, which is a tea, and I guess because I'm half Argentine,
we grew up drinking mate. I think I was drinking mate from the time I
was about three or four years old. I don't suggest that for kids. I
don't think kids should be ingesting caffeine. But anyway I did it and
I still ingest mate. Mate increases GLP-1. GLP-1 is in the glucagon
pathway. So let's just quickly return to our biochemistry. As you
recall, fat is mobilized from body fat stores and then it's burned up.
It's oxidized in cells. It actually needs to be converted into ATP.
And those fatty acids are essentially converted into ATP in the
mitochondria of the cell. High insulin prevents that from happening
and glucagon facilitates that process. Glucagon facilitates that
process through increases in GLP-1. The short takeaway is mate
increases GLP-1 and yes, increases the percentage of fat that you will
burn. It increases fat burning. And that is especially true, it turns
out from the scientific literature, if you ingest mate prior to
exercise of any kind. So if you want to burn more fat drinking mate
before exercise is good. Drinking it at rest when you're not
exercising will also help shift your metabolism toward enhanced
burning of fat by increasing fat oxidation. Now, there's a whole
category of pharmaceuticals that's being developed right now that are
in late stage trials or are in use for the treatment of diabetes which
capitalize on this GLP-1 pathway. They go by various names and there
are people on the internet who are selling these things. They are
prescription drugs and I want to emphasize that they are prescription
drugs and you obviously wouldn't want to use any of these without a
prescription and a requirement. It does seem that they are effective
for the treatment of certain kinds of diabetes and lead to fairly
significant weight loss and reduction in appetite. So this is kind of
the modern version of GLP-1 is pharmaceuticals of GLP-1 metabolism are
drugs such as somatical, I can never pronounce this. I can't seem to
pronounce many things it seems. Semaglutide is the way I would
pronounce it. S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E. Semaglutide but that's not the
way you pronounce it. But Semaglutide is the way that it's been
described on the internet. In any case, this compound increases GLP-1.
It's actually a GLP-1 analog in some cases, and they go by various
types of trade names. So the GLP-1 pathway is interesting. Most
people, including myself, are not interested in taking a prescription
drug to increase GLP-1, I do it through the ingestion of mate. I just
get the mate leaves, pour water over it and drink it. What's kind of
interesting, that's not often discussed is that you can increase the
amount of GLP-1 by, you can essentially reuse the tea. The first time
you drink it it can be very, very intense. And in fact, some people
find that mate almost tastes like burnt leaves. It's too intense. You
don't want the water to be too hot. But I learned this trick from a
friend. You can reuse the leaves over and over again, probably for
about a day before they go bad. And in doing that, you start to
extract more and more of the compounds from the mate leaf that
increased GLP-1. So it's kind of cool. You can kind of get an
increased effect. So what I'll typically do is make a about 16 to 30
ounces and just sip it throughout the day, and I do like it before I
train. Some people who don't like mate might prefer something like
guayusa, which is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A. G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa which
is from Ecuador, despite the USA ending to it. It's from Ecuador. And
it's a sweeter tasting tea. It doesn't have any sweetener in it, but
the leaf of the guayusa plant is sweeter than the mate plant. I
sometimes will mix the two and then make the tea with that. There's no
mate or guayusa sponsor of the podcast. These are just tools to
increase GLP-1 and fat oxidation. And again, the Semaglutide is the
prescription version of the that's kind of the heavy artillery GLP-1
stimulant, and again should be only explored with a prescription. So
those are the compounds that really increase fat oxidation directly.
There are going to be a number of things that impact insulin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=6030"&gt;Berberine, Metformin: Glucose/Insulin Reduction, Increase Fat Oxidation: But Caution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and glucagon that are going to shift the body toward more fat burning.
We talked about a lot of these during the episode on hormones. We
talked about it. We did a whole episode on hormones and metabolism.
And so for instance, berberine, which comes from a plant or metformin
are compounds that are now in kind of growing use for reducing blood
glucose. They are very potent at reducing blood glucose, which will
reduce insulin because the job of the hormone insulin is to
essentially manage glucose in the bloodstream. So there are a huge
gallery of compounds that will reduce insulin and thereby can increase
fat oxidation. And that's because, as I mentioned before, fat
oxidation, this conversion of fatty acids into ATP in the mitochondria
is inhibited by insulin. So if you keep insulin low, you're going to
increase that process. Which brings us full circle back to the issue
of diet and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=6088"&gt;Gardner Lab Results: What You Eat May Not Matter, But Adherence Is Key Tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is really solid evidence from the Gardner Lab at Stanford and
from other labs showing that, when you look at different diets, you
look at low fat diets, high fat diets, keto diets, intermittent
fasting, provided people stick to their particular diet, it doesn't
really matter which diet you follow. You can still get a caloric
deficit and you get weight loss. Adherence however is always an issue.
And so what I always say is, that you want to use the eating plan that
is obviously beneficial to your health, but the one that allows you to
adhere to whatever it is that the particular nutrition protocol is,
right? If you can't stick with something, then it's not very
worthwhile. But from the purely scientific standpoint, there's also an
advantage to keeping insulin low. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean
you go to zero carbohydrate. I've talked before about my preferred way
of eating is to go lower or no carbohydrates throughout the day for
alertness to get that adrenaline release and the focus that goes with
it, et cetera, and the ability to think and move and do all the things
I need to do during the day. And then I eat carbohydrates at night
'cause it facilitates the transition to sleep. That's what works for
me. But when insulin is low, you do place your system in a position to
oxidize more fat. And so that's why I think a lot of people do see
benefit from lower carbohydrate or moderate carbohydrate diets,
because when insulin is low, you are in a position to oxidize more
fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=6180"&gt;examine.com &amp;amp; Enter “Yerba Mate”: Lowers Heart Rate Even Though Is a Stimulant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both from exercise and at rest. And I should mention, because I often
mention and it's appropriate to mention that if you're interested in
looking at the effects of caffeine, of mate, guayusa things of that
sort, GLP-1 you want to learn more about those. You can go to this
wonderful website which is free www.examine.com. You can put in yerba
mate, it will describe the three studies that show increased fat
oxidation, both during exercise and at rest, and as a consequence not
surprisingly and increase in metabolic rate. One thing that's
interesting about mate is it causes a slight decrease in heart rate
for reasons that still escape me. There's a single study showing that
heart rate is slightly reduced which is kind of nice because if, when
I drink too much caffeine my heart rate goes up, maybe that would
increase my fidgeting and my fat burning, but I don't like the feeling
of having my basal heart rate being up too high. I like my heart rate
elevate during exercise, but not when I'm just kind of resting or
working and throughout the day. And for some reason that I don't
understand there's an effect of mate of increasing fat oxidation but
reducing heart rate just slightly. So that's interesting. And it
probably lends itself [indistinct] explains the subjective experience
that I've had of that mate has kind of a little nice even mellow
stimulant. It's not this really supercharged stimulant like caffeine
from coffee or other sources. Although if you drink too much mate it
will also make you jittery. And there's one more compound that I think
we should discuss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=6275"&gt;Acetly-L-Carnitine: Facilitates Fat Oxidation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in terms of increasing fat loss, and that's carnitine or acetyl-L-
carnitine, they lie in the same pathway. We can return to our basic
knowledge now of fat mobilization and oxidation. After fat is
mobilized and makes it into cells and needs to be oxidized. So the
literally the burning of fat and conversion of it into energy that is
accomplished and is facilitated by the presence of glucagon being
elevated, GLP increases that process and insulin being low. And we
talked about some ways to manage insulin both in this episode and in
previous episode. L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine in particular
facilitates fat oxidation. It helps convert fatty acids into ATP. And
indeed supplementing L-carnitine can increase fat loss. That's been
shown. At what dosages? Well, people ingest anywhere from 500
milligrams to two grams per day in divided doses typically. Some
people who are really extreme are taking injectable L-carnitine, I've
certainly not tried that. I confess I have used it in pill form from
time to time but in part, because of the fat oxidation effects, but
also because of the other effects that it tends to have. So in
exploring the effects that acetyl-L-carnitine has, it has a huge
variety of effects on cellar metabolism. It can reduce ammonia in the
blood that is actually a quite strong effect. It can reduce things
like C-reactive protein, which is you want to C-reactive protein
levels to be managed. You do not want them too high. Can slightly
reduce blood glucose. I can slightly increase HDLC, the good form of
the blood lipid and slightly reduce overall cholesterol. And as I
mentioned, it can slightly modify the pathway involving glucagon, such
that you get a considerable effect, not a huge effect on fat
oxidation, so it can improve pat oxidation rates. It has a number of
other effects, some of which I talked during the month on hormones and
that sort of thing. It has strong effects on rates of pregnancy and
sperm quality. So clearly carnitine is doing lots of different things
and lots of different cells. It's impacting sperm motility. They're in
a large number of studies supporting that. Slight reductions in blood
pressure and has these interesting effects on reducing fatigue during
exercise, reducing inflammatory markers like interleukin 6. So it has
a number of effects that on the whole are quote unquote positive or at
least in the direction of things that you may want. And I should
emphasize may. You certainly don't need a acetyl-L-carnitine in order
to lose fat, but now that you understand the cellular process by which
fat is mobilized and oxidized, it should make sense that if
L-carnitine is important for converting fatty acids into energy, then
supplementing L-carnitine make sense. Acetyl-L-carnitine is the type
of L-carnitine or the form of L-carnitine I should say, that is
transported and utilized most easily by the body. And so that's why
sometimes we distinguish between L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&amp;amp;t=6480"&gt;Summary List of Tools &amp;amp; How Nervous System Controls Fat Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once again, we've covered an enormous amount of material. We've
talked about the science of fat loss and in particular, we've explored
this topic from the perspective of the nervous system. How neurons and
in particular the release of things like adrenaline, epinephrin can
facilitate fat mobilization and oxidation. We talked about NEAT,
fidgeting, this non-exercise type movement that can greatly increase
caloric burn. And why that is. We talked about shiver, another form of
non-exercise movement that can really increase both caloric
expenditure due to the shiver, due to the movement, as well as
increase thermogenesis the heating up of the body through things like
brown fat, and even the conversion of white fat to brown fat which is
a good thing if you want to oxidize fat. We talked about cold as a
particular stimulus to induce shiver and how to use getting into, an
out of cold as a way to stimulate shiver and avoid cold adaptation so
that you continue to oxidize and burn fat, if that's your goal. If you
want to check out the protocols for that, there at
www.thecoldplunge.com and in weeks to come we're going to be adding
more protocols to that website not just for fat loss, but for things
like resilience, reducing inflammation, et cetera. So be sure to check
those out again, those are totally cost-free. Talked about exercise.
How rather than thinking about cardiovascular or weight training
exercise, that we should perhaps look through the lens of this
adrenaline system and how it interacts with fat stores and think about
low, medium or high intensity exercise. Whether or not we show up to
that fasted or not. Turns out showing up to that fasted can be useful,
if you start with high intensity movements and then move into lower
intensity type exercise. If you're going to go long duration, it
probably doesn't matter unless you're exercising longer than 90
minutes, whether or not you eat or not. We talked about caffeine as a
stimulant and a stimulus for epinephrin and adrenaline release as a
way to access more fat metabolism. And we talked about compounds that
come from things like yerba mate and guayusa tea, this GLP-1 pathway
that can trigger increased fat oxidation so much so that the
pharmaceutical companies are now developing compounds specifically to
increase GLP-1 for treatment of diabetes and obesity. But you can
leverage the GLP-1 pathway through the ingestion of things like mate
or guayusa if that's of interest to you. And then we talked about
L-carnitine and how L-carnitine itself is critical for the fat
oxidation within individual cells. The conversion of fatty acids to
energy. And why having your insulin low and things like L-carnitine
and glucagon levels high or sufficient at least can facilitate the
burning of fat, fat oxidation. So we covered a lot of material. That's
a lot of protocols I realize that didn't... The little list I just
gave right there didn't even begin to get into all the details and
corners that we discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this conversation interesting both for sake of
understanding fat loss and how to lose fat more quickly and to lose
more of it, if that's your goal. As well as simply to understand the
biology of fat metabolism from a different perspective, from the
perspective of the nervous system. If you're enjoying this podcast and

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [instrumental music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and
science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that
theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first
sponsor is Belcampo Meat Company. Belcampo Meat Company is a
regenerative farm in Northern California that raises organic grass fed
and grass-finished certified humane meats. I eat meat about once a
day. I'm neither pure carnivore, nor am I a vegetarian. Obviously I
eat meat. The way I eat is I tend to fast until about noon and then I
have my first meal which generally consists of a piece of beef. It's
either ground beef or a steak. I like ribeyes, I like flat irons,
these kinds of things and a small salad, sometimes a large salad. And
then throughout the day, I generally am low carb until the evening
when I eat pasta and rice and things of that sort. Eating that way is
what optimizes my levels of alertness and optimizes my sleep. I've
talked about this on previous podcast episodes, Now, because I eat
meat essentially every day, the source of that meat is extremely
important to me. I want it to be healthy for me and I want the animals
that it comes from to be healthy and to have lived a good life.
Conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots and they eat a
diet of inflammatory grains, which is terrible for them and it's
terrible for us when we eat those meats. Belcampo's animals graze on
open pastures and seasonal grasses, which results in meat that is
higher in nutrients and healthy fats. They actually have very high
levels of Omega threes which I've also talked about on this podcast,
are important for mental and physical health for a variety of reasons.
The way Belcampo raises its animals is also good for the environment.
They practice regenerative agriculture, which means it's climate
positive and carbon negative which translates to good for us and good
for the planet. You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats to be
delivered straight to your door using my code Huberman by going to
belcampo.com/huberman and you'll get 20% off your first time order.
That's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off. Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized
nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help
you better understand your body and reach your health goals. I've long
been a believer in getting blood work done for the simple reason that
many, if not most of the factors that impact our immediate and
longterm health can only be assessed from a blood test. And now with
the advent of modern DNA tests, we can get additional information
about our current health status and our health trajectory. One of
major problems with blood tests and DNA tests available for most
sources is that you get the numbers back and you can easily see
whether or not those numbers are within the standard range or outside
the range. But it's very hard to know what to do with that
information. Also what the various factors are that are being measured
is often very cryptic. With InsideTracker, they clarify everything.
They make it very clear and simple as to what each of those factors
relates to, so they give you some understanding of what those are and
they give you ideas and suggestions about things that you can do with
your lifestyle, changes to your diet, changes to your supplementation,
changes to your sleep schedule or exercise patterns that can serve to
optimize the levels of those various factors and your DNA. In
addition, they have something called the inner age test which compares
your chronological age which you already know with your biological age
which gives you a sense of your lifespan or predicted lifespan. So
that's crucially important, and you can imagine why many people,
including me would want that information. If you'd like to try

episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is
an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been using
Athletic Greens for well over a decade now. I started using Athletic
Greens and I still use Athletic Greens because I find it rather
dizzying to know which vitamins and minerals to take. And with
Athletic Greens, I cover all my bases of vitamins and minerals. In
addition, it has probiotics and we now know from an enormous number of
quality peer reviewed studies that the gut microbiome is critically
important for our immune system function, for the gut brain access and
for our mental functions and probiotics are one way to support the gut
brain axis and the gut health generally. With Athletic Greens, I
basically just add water, put in a little bit of lemon juice 'cause
that's the way I like it. Mix it up, it tastes delicious. I'll do that
once or twice a day. It's compatible with fasting at least for me, it
doesn't take me out of a fasting mode which I do early in the day. So
most often I'll have my Athletic Greens early in the day. And then
sometimes I'll also have another one late in the evening, or sometimes
even before bed. I'm able to sleep after drinking it without a
problem. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you can claim a
special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which are
these little packs that make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
while you're on the road or in the car or on a plane. It makes all of
that very simple. And in addition, they will give you a year supply of
vitamin D3 K2. There are also a lot of data supporting the fact that
vitamin D3 is critical for a variety of health metrics. We all know
that we can get vitamin D3 from the sun, but many people including me
were not getting enough sunlight or D3 even if I was getting a lot of
sunlight. I know that 'cause I had my blood levels measured of D3. So
I use vitamin D3 every day in addition to the other things I take,
including Athletic Greens. If you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
you'll get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs and a year
supply of the vitamin D3 and K2, That's athleticgreens.com/huberman to
claim the special offer. This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=388"&gt;Skill Acquisition: Mental &amp;amp; Physical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we're talking all about physical performance. So that means athletic
performance, recreational exercise, weightlifting, running, swimming,
yoga, skills and skill learning. Today, we're going to talk about and
focus on skill learning. We are going to focus on how to learn skills
more quickly in particular motor skills. This will also translate to
things like musical skills and playing instruments, but we're mainly
going to focus on physical movements of the body that extend beyond
the hands like just playing the piano or the fingers like playing the
guitar. But everything we're going to talk about will also serve the
formation and the consolidation and the performance of other types of
skills. So if you're interested in how to perform better, whether or
not it's dance or yoga or even something that's just very repetitive
like running or swimming, this podcast episode is for you. We're going
to go deep into the science of skill learning. And we are going to
talk about very specific protocols that the science points to and has
verified, allow you to learn more quickly to embed that learning so
that you remember it and to be able to build up skills more quickly
than you would otherwise. We are also going to touch on a few things
that I get asked about a lot, but fortunately recently I've had the
time to go deep into the literature, extract the data for you and
that's mental visualization. How does visualizing a particular skill
or practice serve the learning and or the consolidation of that
practice. It turns out there are some absolutely striking protocols
that one can use, striking meaning they allow you to learn faster and
they allow you to remember how to do things more quickly and better
than if you were not doing this mental rehearsal. But the pattern of
mental rehearsal and when you do that mental rehearsal turns out to be
vitally important. So I'm excited for today's episode. We're going to
share a lot of information with you and they're going to be a lot of
very simple takeaways. So let's get started. Before we get into the
topic of skill learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=520"&gt;Clarification About Cold, Heat &amp;amp; Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and tools for accelerating skill learning, I want to briefly revisit
the topic of temperature which was covered in the last episode and
just highlight a few things and clear up some misunderstandings. So
last episode talked about these incredible data from my colleague,
Craig Heller's lab at Stanford. He's in the department of biology,
showing that cooling the palms in particular ways and at particular
times can allow athletes or just recreational exercisers to do more
pull-ups, dips, bench presses per unit time, to run further, to cycle
further and to feel better doing it. There really are incredible data
that are anchored in the biology of the vascular system, the blood
supply and how it's involved in cooling us. Many of you, dozens of you
in fact said, "Wait a second, you gave us a protocol in this episode
"which says that we should cool our palms periodically "throughout
exercise in order to be able to do more work. "But on the episode,
before that on growth hormone "and thyroid hormone, you said that
heating up the body "is good for release of growth hormone." And I
just want to clarify that both things are true. These are two separate
protocols. You should always warm up before you exercise. That warmup
will not increase your body temperature or the muscle temperature to
the point where it's going to diminish your work capacity, that it's
going to harm your performance. The cooling of the palms, which is
really just a route to cool your core in an efficient way, the most
efficient way, in fact is about improving performance. Heating up the
body with exercise and focusing on heat increases or using sauna for
heat increases is geared toward growth hormone release, which is a
separate matter. So you can do both of these protocols but you would
want to do them at separate times. So just to make this very concrete
before I move on to today's topic. If you're interested in doing more
work, being able to do more sets and reps per unit time and feel
better doing it or to run further or to cycle further, then cooling
the palms periodically as I described in the previous episode is going
to be the way to go. If you're interested in getting growth hormone
release, well then hot sauna. And I offered some other tools if you
don't have a sauna in the episode on growth hormone and thyroid
hormone is going to be the way to go. So those are separate protocols.
You can include them in your fitness regime and your training regime,
but you do want to do them at separate times. And as a last point
about this, I also mentioned that caffeine can either help or hinder
performance depending on whether or not you're caffeine adapted
because of the ways that caffeine impacts body temperature and all
sorts of things like vasodilation and constriction. It's very simple.
If you enjoy caffeine before your workouts and you're accustomed to
caffeine, meaning you drink it three or five times or more a week. 100
to 300 milligrams this is a typical daily dose of caffeine. Some of
you are ingesting more, some less. If you do that regularly, well,
then it's going to be just fine to ingest caffeine before you train.
It's not going to impact your body temperature and your vasodilation
or constriction in ways that will hinder you. However, if you're not a
regular caffeine user and you're thinking, "Oh, I'm going to drink a
cup of coffee "and get this huge performance enhancing effect." Well,
that's not going to happen. Chances are it's going to lead to
increases in body temperature and changes in the way that blood flow
is happening in your body, and in particular on these palmer surfaces
and in your face that is going to likely diminish performance. So if
you enjoy caffeine and you're accustomed to it, so-called caffeine
adapted, enjoy it before your training. If you regularly, excuse me,
if you do not regularly use caffeine, then you probably do not want to
view caffeine as a performance enhancing tool. And while we're on the
topic of tools and because this is a month on athletic performance and
exercise and physical skill learning,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=765"&gt;Tool: How To Quickly Eliminate the Side-Stitch ‘Cramp’ &amp;amp; Boost HRV Entrainment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to offer an additional tool that I've certainly found useful,
which is how to relieve the so-called side stitch or side cramp when
running or swimming. This actually relates to respiration and to the
nervous system and it is not a cramp. If you've ever been out running
and you felt like you had a pain on your side, that pain could be any
number of things, but what feels like cramping of your side is
actually due to what's called collateralization of the phrenic nerve
which is a lot harder to say than a side cramp or a side stitch. But
here's the situation. You have a set of nerves, which is called the
phrenic nerve P-H-R-E-N-I-C. The phrenic nerve, which extends down
from your brainstem essentially, this region to your diaphragm to
control your breathing. It has a collateral, meaning it has a branch
just like the branch on a tree that innovates your liver. And if you
are not breathing deeply enough, what can happen is you can get what's
called sometimes a referenced pain. Reference pain is probably going
to be familiar to any of you have ever read about how to recognize
heart attack. People have heart attacks will sometimes have pain on
one side of their body, the left arm, sometimes people that have pain
in a part of their back or suddenly also get pain in their shoulder or
part of their face. This has to do with the fact that many of our
nerves branch, meaning they're collateralized to different organs and
areas of the body. And the way those nerves are woven together, it's
often the case that if we disrupt the pattern of firing of electrical
activity in one of those nerve branches that the other ones are
affected too. The side stitch, the pain in your side as often because
of the contractions of the diaphragm because of the way you're
breathing while you're exercising, running, or swimming or biking. And
as a consequence, you feel pain in your side but that's not a cramp.
The way to relieve it is very simple. You do the physiological side
that I've talked about in previous episodes of the podcast and
elsewhere which has a double inhale through the nose, very deep and
then a long exhale. And you might want to repeat that two or three
times. Typically that will relieve the side stitch because of the way
that it changes the firing patterns of the phrenic nerve. So the side
stitch is annoying, it's painful, sometimes we think we're dehydrated
and you might be dehydrated. But oftentimes it's just that we're
breathing in a way that causes some referenced pain of the liver. We
call it a side stitch or a side cramp, and you can relieve it very
easily through the double inhale, long exhale. That pattern done two
or three times, often you can continue to engage in the exercise while
you do the double inhale exhale, and it will just relieve itself that
way. So give it a try if you experience the side stitch. Some people I
know are also doing the double inhale, long exhale during long
continuous bouts of exercise. I actually do this when I run. We have
decent data although these are still unpublished data that that can
engage a kind of regular cadence of heart rate variability. So there
are a number of reasons why this physiological side can be useful, but
it certainly can be useful for relieving the side stitch or so-called
side cramp. Let's talk about the acquisition of new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=968"&gt;Physical Skills: Open-Loop Versus Closed-Loop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These could be skills such as a golf swing or a tennis swing or you're
shooting free throws or you're learning to dance or you're learning an
instrument. I'm mainly going to focus on athletic performance. There
are basically two types of skills. Open loop and closed loop. Open
loop skills are skills where you perform some sort of motor action and
then you wait and you get immediate feedback as to whether or not it
was done correctly or not. A good example will be throwing darts at a
dartboard. So if you throw the dart, you get feedback about whether or
not you hit the bullseye, you're off the dart board, or you're some
other location on the dart board, that's open loop. Closed loop would
be something that's more continuous. So let's say you're a runner and
you're starting to do some speed work and some sprints. And you're
running and you can kind of feel whether or not you're running
correctly, or maybe even have a coach and they're correcting your
stride or you're trying to do some sort of skill, like a hopscotch
skill, which maybe you're doing the ladder work where you're stepping
between designated spaces on the ground. That's closed loop because as
you go, you can adjust your behavior and you can adjust the distance
of your steps, or you can adjust your speed or you can adjust your
posture and you are able to essentially do more practice per unit time
but you're getting feedback on a moment to moment basis. So you have
open loop and closed loop. And just to make this very clear, open loop
would be practicing your tennis serve. So let's say that you set a
target on the other side of the net. You throw the ball up and you hit
the ball, it goes over that's open-loop. You'll know whether or not
you were in the court, you were on the location you wanted to hit or
close to it or not, that's open loop. Closed loop would be if you're
in a regular can. So maybe you're learning a swim stroke, or maybe
you're trying to learn a particular rhythm on the drum. So maybe
you're trying to learn a particular beat. I'm not very musical, so I'm
not going to embarrass myself by giving an example of this, although
later I will, where you're trying to get a particular rhythm down. And
if you're not getting it, you can adjust in real time and try and
catch up or slow down or speed up, et cetera. So hopefully you'll
understand open loop and closed loop. You should always know before
you try and learn a skill, whether or not it's open loop or closed
loop and I'll return to why that's important shortly. But if you want
to learn something, ask is it open loop or closed loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=1130"&gt;Three Key Components To Any Skill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are essentially three components of any skill that involves
motor movement. And those are sensory perception, actually perceiving
what you are doing and what's happening around you. So what you see,
what you hear, sometimes you're paying attention to what you're doing
specifically like the trajectory of your arm or how you're moving your
feet. If you're learning to dance, sometimes you're more focused on
something that's happening outside of you, like you're listening for
something in music or you're paying attention to the way your partner
is moving, et cetera. So there's sensory input. Then there are the
actual movements. So they're the movements of your limbs and body. And
then there's something called proprioception and proprioception is
often discussed as kind of a sixth sense of knowing where your limbs
are in relation to your body. So proprioception is vitally important.
If I reached down and pick up this pen and pick it up, I'm not
thinking about where the pen in my hand is relative to my body, but
proprioceptively, I'm aware of it at kind of a six sense deeper
subconscious level. I can also make myself aware of where my limbs
are. And typically when we learn, we are placing more focus on
proprioception than we do ordinarily. So if I get up from this chair
and I happen to walk out of the room, I don't think about where my
feet are landing relative to one another. But if my leg had fallen
asleep because I had been leaning on one of the nerves of my leg or
something like that, and my leg feels all tingly or numb. I and you,
if this were to happen to you, would immediately notice a shift in
gait. It would feel strange, I'd have to pay attention to how I'm
stepping. And the reason is I'm not getting any proprioceptive
feedback. Now, skill learning has a lot of other dimensions too, but
those are the main ones that we're going to focus on. So just to
remind you, you need to know open loop or closed loop and you need to
know whether or not, excuse me, you need to know that there's sensory
perception what you're paying attention to, movements themselves and
proprioception. And there's one other important thing that you need to
know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=1260"&gt;Sources of Control for Movement: 1) CPGs Govern Rhythmic Learned Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is that movement of any kind is generated from one, two or three
sources within your nervous system, within your brain and body. These
are central pattern generators which are sometimes called CSPGs,
excuse me, CPGSs, CSPGs are something entirely different in biology.
CPGSs, this just goes to show that I have a module. CSPGs are
chondroid and sulfate proteoglycans. They have nothing to do with this
topic. CPGSs are central pattern generators or CPGs, they're sometimes
called. These CPGs are in your spinal cord, mine and yours, different
ones and they generate repetitive movements. So if you're walking, if
you're running, if you're cycling, if you're breathing, which
presumably you are and you're doing that in a regular rhythmic
cadence, central pattern generators are controlling that movement.
After you learn how to walk, run, swim, cycle, do anything really,
much of the work is handed off to the central pattern generators. And
there were experiments that were done in the 60s, 70s and 80s that
actually looked at decerebrate animals and even decerebrate humans.
These are humans and animals that lack a cerebral cortex. They lack
much of the brain and yet they can engage in what's called a fictive
movement. So it sounds like a kind of barbaric experiment. I'm glad I
wasn't the one to have to do them but this is the stuff of
neuroscience textbooks that cats or dogs or mice that have their
neocortex removed put them on a treadmill, they'll walk just fine. And
they will adjust their speed of walking just fine even though they
basically lack all their thinking and decision-making brain. And it
turns out humans that have, unfortunately, massive strokes to their
cortex and lack any neocortex but preserve the central pattern
generators will also walk just fine, even though they lack any of the
other stuff in the brain. So these CPGs or CPGSs are amazing, and they
control a lot of our already learned behavior. When you're really good
at something, CPGs are controlling a lot of that behavior. And that's
true also for a golf swing. Even if it's not really repetitive,
somebody who's really good at golf it's going to, I guess you call it
a T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=1410"&gt;Upper Motor Neurons for Deliberate Movement &amp;amp; Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You put the ball on the T. I show with my knowledge of golf. I've only
done mini golf, frankly, but someday maybe I'll learn how to golf, but
you set the golf ball down and swing, set the golf ball down, swing.
Central pattern generators are going to handle a lot of that. If I
were to go to the golf course. Stanford has a beautiful golf course.
If I were to go out there and put a ball on the T, my central pattern
generators would not be involved in that at all. The moment I bring
the club back to swing, it's going to engage other things. And the
other things that's going to engage because I don't know that behavior
now or then is upper motor neurons. We have motor neurons in our
cortex, in our neocortex that control deliberate action. And those are
the ones that you're engaging when you are learning. Those are the
ones that you have to pay attention in order to engage. And that's
what's happening, for instance, if I decide I'm going to reach down
and pick up my pen, which I rarely think about, but now I'm thinking
about it and I'm going to do this in a very deliberate way. I'm going
to grab with these two fingers and lift. My upper motor neurons are
now involved. So upper motor neurons are very important because a
little bit later in the episode when we talk about how to use
visualization in order to accelerate skill learning, it's going to
leverage these upper motor neurons in very particular ways. So we have
CPGs for rhythmic movement, upper motor neurons for deliberate
unlearned movements or movements that we are in the process of
learning. And then we have what are called lower motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=1500"&gt;Lower Motor Neurons Control Action Execution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower motor neurons are the ones in our spinal cord that send little
wires out to our muscles which actually caused the firing of those
muscle fibers. So the way to think about this as you've got upper
motor neurons which talk to CPGs and the lower motor neurons. So it's
really simple. And now, you know most everything there is to know
about the neural pathways controlling movement, at least for sake of
this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=1526"&gt;What To Focus On While Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anytime we learn something, we have to decide what to place our
sensory perception on, meaning what are we going to focus on. That's
critical if you're listening to this and you're the type of person who
likes taking notes, this should be the second question you ask.
Remember the first question is, is it open loop or closed loop? The
second question should be, what should I focus my attention on,
auditory attention, visual attention or proprioception. Should I focus
on where my limbs are relative to my body or should I focus on the
outcome? This is a critical distinction. You can decide to learn how
to do a golf swing or learn how to shoot free throws or learn how to
dance tango and decide that you are going to focus on the movements of
your partner or the positions of your feet. You maybe are going to
look at them, maybe you're going to sense them. You're going to
actually feel where they are, or maybe you're going to sense the
position and posture of your body, which is more proprioception. So
you have to allocate your attention. And I'm going to tell you how to
allocate your attention best in order to learn faster. So these are
the sorts of decisions that you have to make. Fortunately for you, you
don't have to think about whether or not you're going to use your
upper motor neurons and your lower motor neurons or not, because if
you don't know how to do something, you're automatically going to
engage your upper motor neurons. And if you do, then you're not going
to use your upper motor neurons. You're mainly going to rely on
central pattern generators. You are always using your lower motor
neurons to move muscle. So we can really simplify things now. I've
given you a lot of information but we can simplify it. Basically open
loop or closed loop, that's one question and what am I going to focus
on? And then your neurology will take care of the rest. So now I want
to talk about realistic expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=1630"&gt;The Reality of Skill Learning &amp;amp; the 10,000 Hours Myth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in Hollywood presumably, it got embedded in somebody's mind
that instant skill acquisition was possible, that you could take a
particular pill or you could touch a particular object or you could
have a wand wave over you and you would suddenly have a skill. And so
that is the result of Hollywood at all. It doesn't exist, at least not
in reality. And I love movies, but it simply doesn't exist. Then the
self-help literature created another rule called the 10,000 hours
rule. And frankly, that doesn't really match the literature, at least
the scientific literature either. I like it because it implies that
learning takes time, which is more accurate than the Hollywood at all
instant skill acquisition rule, which isn't really a rule, it's a
myth. But the 10,000 hours rule overlook something crucial, which is
that it's not about hours, it's about repetitions. Now, of course
there's a relationship between time and repetitions, but there are
some beautiful experiments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=1710"&gt;Repetitions &amp;amp; The Super Mario Effect: Error Signals vs. Error Signals + Punishment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that point to the fact that by simple adjustment of what you are
focused on as you attempt to learn a new skill, you can adjust the
number of repetitions that you do, you adjust your motivation for
learning and you can vastly accelerate learning. Some of you may
recognize this by its internet name, which is not a scientific term,
which is the super Mario effect. There's actually a quite good video
on YouTube describing the super Mario effect. I think it was a
YouTuber who has I think a background in science and he did an
interesting experiment. And I'll talk about his experiment first and
then I will talk about the neurobiology that supports the result that
he got. The super Mario effect relates to the game super Mario
brothers, but you'll see why at the end. But basically what they did
was they had 50,000 subjects, which is a enormous number of subjects
learn a program, essentially taking words from a computer program or
the commands for a computer program that were kind of clustered in a
column on the right. So these are the sorts of things that computer
programmers will be familiar with but other people won't. And those
commands are essentially, they essentially translate to things like go
forward. And then if it's a right hand turn in the maze, then go right
and continue until you hit a choice point, et cetera. So it's a bunch
of instructions, but the job of the subjects in these experiments were
to organize those instructions in a particular way that would allow a
little cursor to move through the main successfully. So basically the
goal was, or at least what the subjects were told is that anyone can
learn to computer program. And if somebody can just organize the
instructions in the right way, then they can program this little
cursor to move through amaze, very simple. And yet, if you don't have
any background in computer programming, or even if you do, it takes
some skill. You have to know what commands to give in what particular
order. And they made that very easy. You could just assemble them in a
list over onto the right. So people started doing this. Now there were
two groups and some one half of the subjects, if they got it wrong,
meaning they entered a command and the cursor would move and it was
the wrong command for this little cursor to move through the maze,
they saw a signal jump up on their screen that said, that did not
work, please try again. That's it, if they put in the wrong command or
is in the wrong sequence, it'll say that did not work please try
again. And then the subjects would reorganize the instructions and
then the little cursor would continue. And if they got it wrong again,
it would say that does not work, please try again. The other half of
the subjects, if they got something wrong were told you just lost five
points, please continue. So, that's the only difference in the
feedback that they got. Now I have to confess, I would have predicted
based on my knowledge of dopamine circuitry and reward contingency and
epinephrin and stress and motivated learning. And this other thing
that we've been told in many many books on behavioral economics and in
the self-help literature, which is that people will work much harder
to prevent losing something than they will to gain something, that you
hear all the time. And it turns out that that's not at all what
happened. If they looked at the success rate of the subjects, what
they found was that the subjects that were told that did not work,
please try again, had a 68% success rate. 68% of them went on to
successfully program this cursor moving through the maze. Whereas the
ones that were told you lost five points had a 52% success rate, which
is a significant difference. But the source of the success or the lack
of success is really interesting. The subjects that were told that did
not work, please try again, tried many, many more times per unit time.
In other words, they made more attempts at programming this thing to
allow this cursor to move through the maze. Whereas the people that
were told you lost five points gave up earlier or gave up entirely.
Okay, so let's just step back from this because to me, this was very
surprising. It violates a lot of things that I'd heard in the kind of
popular culture or the self-help literature that people will work much
harder to avoid losing something than they will to gain something. And
it didn't really fit with what I understood about reward contingencies
and dopamine, but it did fit well with another set of experiments that
I'm very familiar with from the neuroscience literature. And I'll give
you the punchline first. And then we're going to take what these data
mean and we're going to talk about a learning protocol that you can
use that will allow you to learn skills faster by willingly
participating in more repetitions of the skill learning, meaning you
will want to do more repetitions even if you're getting it wrong some
or most of the time. So the experiment that I want to tell you about
is called the tube test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=2040"&gt;Learning To Win, Every Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is generally done in mice, although it's sometimes been done
in rats and it has a lot of parallels to some things that you've
probably seen and experienced even in human life, in regular life,
maybe even in your life. So here's the experiment. You take two rats,
you put them in a tube or two mice, you put them in a tube. And mice
and rats, they don't like to share the same tube. So what they'll do
is they'll start pushing each other back and forth, back and forth.
Sooner or later, one of the rats or mice pushes the other one out. The
one that got pushed out is the loser, the one that gets the tube is
the winner. Now you take the winner, you give it a new competitor. And
what you find is that the mouse or rat that won previously has a much
higher than chance probability of winning the second time. In other
words, winning before leads to winning again. And the reverse is also
true. If you take the loser and you put that loser in with another
mouse, fresh mouse, new mouse, the loser typically will lose at much
greater probability than chance. And this is not related to
differences in strength or size or testosterone or any other things
that might leap to mind as explanations for this because those were
all controlled for. Now that results have been known about for
decades. But three years ago, there was a paper published in the
Journal Science, phenomenal journal. It's one of the three apex
journals, that examined the brain area that's involved in this. Turns
out a particular area of the frontal cortex for those of you that want
to know. And they did a simple experiment where the experimenters
increased or decreased the activity of this brain area in the
prefrontal cortex, little sub region of the prefrontal cortex. And
what they found is if they stimulated this brain area, a mouse or rat,
regardless of whether or not it had been a winner or loser before,
became a winner every single time. And they showed that if they
blocked the activity of this brain area, regardless of whether or not
the mouse or rat had been a winner or loser, it became a loser every
single time. And this translated to other scenarios, other competitive
scenarios where they'd put a bunch of mice or rats in a kind of cool
chamber, they'd have a little heat lamp in the corner and mice like
heat. And there was only enough space for one mouse to be under the
heat. And the one that had won in the tube test or that had the brain
area stimulated always got the nice warm spot. So what is this magic
brain area, what is it doing? Well, the reason I'm bringing this up
today and the reason I'm bringing it up on the heels of the super
Mario effect is that stimulation of this brain area had a very simple
and very important effect, which was, it led to more forward steps,
more repetitions, more effort, but not in terms of sheer might and
will, not digging deeper, just more repetitions per unit time. And the
losers had fewer repetitions per unit time. So the super Mario effect,
this online experiment and the tube test, which has been done by
various labs and repeated again and again point to a simple but very
important rule, which is neither the 10,000 hours rule nor the magic
wand Hollywood version of learning. But rather the neuro-biological
explanation for learning a skill is you want to perform as many
repetitions per unit time, as you possibly can. At least when you're
first trying to learn a skill. I want to repeat that, you want to
perform as many repetitions as you possibly can at least when you're
first trying to learn a skill. Now that might sound like a duh, it
just more reps, but it's not so obvious. There's no reason why more
repetitions should necessarily lead to faster learning because you
could also say, well, more repetitions, you can make more errors and
those errors would lead to poor performance like misstepping a number
of times. And in these cases, there's very little feedback. It's not
like every time the rat pushes forward or moves back that it is
sensing, oh I'm winning, I'm losing, I'm winning, I'm losing on a
micro level. It probably does that as it starts to push the other one
out the rat or mouse probably thinks, "I'm winning." And as it's
backing up, it probably thinks, "I'm losing." As you play the game,
the super Mario game, you are told, nope, that didn't work. Nope, that
didn't work, please try again. But the important thing is that the
winners are always generating more repetitions per unit time. It's
just a repeat of performance, repeat of performance even if there are
errors. And that points to something vitally important, which is reps
are important but making error reps is also important. In fact, it
might be the most important factor. So let's talk about errors and why
those solve the problem of what to focus on. Because as I said
earlier, if you want to learn something, you need to know if it's open
loop or closed loop and you need to know what to focus on, where to
place your perception. And that seems like a tough task but errors
will tell you exactly what to focus on. So let's talk about errors and
why you can leverage errors to accelerate skill learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=2366"&gt;Errors Solve the Problem of What Focus On While Trying to Learn Skills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we've established that performing the maximum number of
repetitions per training session is going to be advantageous. And that
might seem obvious but there's a shadowy side to that, which is, well
why would I want to just repeat the same thing over and over again if
I'm getting it wrong, 90% of the time. And the reason is that the
errors actually cue your nervous system to two things; one to error
correction and the other is it opens the door or the window for
neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system's
ability to change in response to experience, essentially to custom
modify itself in order to perform anything better. We did an entire
month on neuroplasticity and I talked a little bit about errors and
why they're important. Now we're going to make this very concrete and
operationalize it, make it very actionable. There was a paper that was
published in 2021 from Norman at all. This is a very important paper.
It was published in the Journal Neuron which is a cell press journal,
excellent journal. The title of the paper gives it away essentially,
which is post error recruitment of frontal sensory cortical
projections promotes attention. Now, what that says is that when you
make an error, it causes an activation of the brain areas that anchor
your attention. Remember we need perception, attention, which they're
essentially the same thing. We need proprioception and we need the
upper and lower motor neurons to communicate in the proper ways. And
this vital question is what to pay attention to. Errors tell your
nervous system that something needs to change. So if you are
performing a task or a skill like you're learning how to dance and
you're stepping on the other person's toes or you're fumbling or
you're not getting it right, those errors are opening the possibility
for plasticity. If you walk away at that point, you've made the exact
wrong choice. Unless the errors are somehow hazardous to your health
or somebody else's wellbeing, you want to continue to engage at a high
repetition rate. That's really where the learning is possible. Without
errors, the brain is not in a position to change itself. Errors
actually cue the frontal cortex networks, what we call top-down
processing and the neuromodulators, things like dopamine and
acetylcholine and epinephrin that will allow for plasticity. So while
the super Mario experiment, the maze experiment was only focused on
generating errors, telling people that wasn't right, please try again
or that wasn't right, you lost five points. The key distinction is
that the errors themselves cued people to the fact that they needed to
change something. So if you're trying to learn a new skill and you're
screwing up and you're making mistakes, the more mistakes you make,
the more plastic your brain becomes such that when you get it right,
that correct pattern will be rewarded and consolidated. And you can
trust that it will because the performance of something correctly is
associated with the release of this neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine
is involved in craving and motivation. It's involved in a lot of
things, but it's also involved in learning. We will do an entire
episode on dopamine and learning but because some of you are probably
wondering, this does not mean that just increasing your dopamine
levels before learning will allow you to learn faster. In fact,
increasing your dopamine levels before learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=2580"&gt;Why Increasing Baseline Levels of Dopamine Prior To Learning Is Bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using pharmacology will actually reduce what's called the signal to
noise. It will make these increases in dopamine that pop up in your
brain that suddenly make you realize, "Oh, I got that one right." It
will make those smaller relative to the background levels of dopamine.
You want a big spike in dopamine when you perform a motor pattern
correctly and you want to make lots of errors, many, many repetitions
of errors in order to get to that correct performance. Now, if you're
like most people you're going to do this in a way that's somewhat
random. Meaning let's say it's a tennis serve. I can't play tennis, I
think I've probably played tennis twice. So if I throw the ball up in
the air and hit it, I'm going to get it wrong and probably hit the
net, then it hit the net. Then I'll probably go too long then I'll
probably go over the fence. At some point, I like to think I'll get it
correct. The dopamine signal for that is going to be quite big and
I'll think, "Okay, what did I do there? "I actually don't know, I
wasn't paying attention. "What I was paying attention to is whether or
not "the ball went to the correct location "on the opposite side of
the net." Remember it's an open loop move, so I don't actually know
what I did correctly. But your nervous system will take care of that
provided I in this case complete more and more and more repetitions.
Now, if I were to just elevate my basil level of dopamine by taking, I
don't know, 1500 milligrams L tyrasine or something, that would be bad
because the increase in dopamine would actually be much lower. We
would say the delta is smaller. The signal to noise is smaller if my
overall levels of dopamine are very, very high. So I'm actually going
to learn less well. So for skill learning, motor skill learning,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=2680"&gt;The Framing Effect (&amp;amp; Protocol Defined)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;increasing your dopamine levels prior is not a good idea. It might
help with motivation to get to the learning but it's not going to
improve the plasticity process itself and it's likely to hinder it.
And so that's very important. So these errors cue the brain that
something was wrong and they open up the possibility for plasticity.
It's what sometimes called the framing effect, it frames what's
important. And so I think this is a shift that we've heard about,
growth mindset which is the incredible discovery and theory and
practice of my colleague, Carol Dweck at Stanford. This is distinct
from that. This isn't about motivation to learn, this is about how you
actually learn. So the key is designate a particular block of time
that you are going to perform repetitions. So maybe that's 30 minutes,
maybe that's an hour. Work for time and then try and perform the
maximum number of repetitions that you can do safely for you and
others per unit time. That's going to be the best way to approach
learning for most sessions. I will talk about other things that one
can do, but making errors is key. And this isn't a motivational
speech. I'm not saying, "Oh, go make errors, "errors are good for you.
"You have to fail in order to win." No, you have to fail in order to
open up the possibility of plasticity, but you have to fail many times
within the same session. And those failures will cue your attention to
the appropriate sensory events. Now, sometimes we're working with a
coach. And so this is a shout out to all the coaches, thank you for
doing what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=2770"&gt;A Note &amp;amp; Warning To Coaches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there needs to be at least what the scientific literature
say. There needs to be a period of each training session whereby the
athlete or the person of any kind can simply pay attention to their
errors without their attention being cued to something else. A really
well-trained coach will say, "Oh, your elbows swinging too high, "or
you're not gripping the racket "in the appropriate way," et cetera.
They can see things that the practitioner can't see. And of course
that's the vitally important. But the practitioner also needs to use
this error recognition signal, they need to basically focus on
something and the errors are going to tell them what to focus on. So
put simply there needs to be a period of time in which it's just
repetition after repetition, after repetition. I think many people
including coaches are afraid that bad habits will get ingrained. And
while indeed that's possible, it's very important that these errors
occur in order to cue the attentional systems and to open the door for
plasticity. So if I'm told, "Look, I'm standing a little wide, "I need
to tighten up my stance a little bit." Great, but then I need to
generate many repetitions from that tighten stance. So if I'm
constantly being cued from the outside about what I'm incorrectly,
that's not going to be as efficient. So for some people, these
learning sessions might be 10 minutes, for some people, it might be an
hour. Whatever you can allocate because your lifestyles will vary in
your whether or not you're a professional athlete, et cetera will
vary. You want to get the maximum number of repetitions in and you
want to make errors. That's allowing for plasticity. So science points
to the fact that there's a particular sequencing of learning sessions
that will allow you to learn faster and to retain the skill learning
and involves doing exactly as I just described, which is getting as
many repetitions as you can in the learning session, paying attention
to the errors that you make. And then the rewards that will be
generated, again, these are neurochemical rewards from the successful
performance of a movement or the approximate successful performance.
So maybe you get the golf swing better but not perfect, but that's
still going to be rewarded with this neurochemical mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=2910"&gt;What To Do Immediately After Your Physical Skill Learning Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then after the session, you need to do something very specific
which is nothing. That's right. There are beautiful data describing
neurons in our hippocampus, this area of our brain involved in the
consolidation of new memories. Those data points to the fact that in
sleep, there's a replay of the sequence of neurons that were involved
in certain behaviors the previous day and sometimes the previous day
before that. However, there are also data that show that after a skill
learning session, any kind of motor movement provided you're not
bringing in a lot more additional new sensory stimuli, there's a
replay of the motor sequence that you performed correctly and there's
an elimination of the motor sequences that you performed incorrectly
and they are run backward in time. So to be very clear about this, if
I were to learn a new skill or navigate a new city or let's just stay
with the motor skill, let's say the free-throw or a golf swing or a
tennis serve, dance move, novice. So I'm still going to make a lot of
errors, don't get it perfectly, but maybe I get a little bit better or
I perform it correctly three times out of 1000. And it sounds like
something I might do and there I'm probably being generous to myself.
After I finished the training session, if I do nothing, I'm not
focused on some additional learning. I'm not bringing a lot of sensory
information in. If I just sit there and close my eyes for five to 10
minutes, even one minute, the brain starts to replay the motor
sequence corresponding to the correct pattern movement, but it plays
that sequence backward. Now why it plays it backward, we don't know.
If I were to wait until sleep or regardless of when I sleep later that
night, the sequence will be replayed forwards in the proper sequence.
Immediately afterward it's played a backward for reasons that are
still unclear. But the replay of that sequence backwards appears to be
important for the consolidation of the skill learning. Now, this is
important because many people are finishing their jujitsu class or
they're finishing their yoga class or they're finishing their dance
class or they're finishing some skill learning and then they're
immediately devoting their attention to something else. You hear a lot
about visualization and we are going to talk about visualization. But
in the kind of obsession with the idea that we can learn things, just
sitting there with our eyes closed without having to perform a
movement, we've overlooked something perhaps even more important or at
least equally important, which is after skill learning, after putting
effort into something, sitting quietly with the eyes closed for one to
five to 10 minutes allows the brain to replay the sequence in a way
that appears important for the more rapid consolidation of the motor
sequence of the pattern and to accelerated learning. If you'd like to
learn more about this, this is not work that I was involved in, I want
to be very clear. There's an excellent paper that covers this and much
more for those of you that really want to dive deep on this and we
will dive deeper in a moment. This is a review that was published in
the Journal Neuron, excellent journal. Many of the papers that I'm
referring to were covered in this review which is titled,
Neuroplasticity Subserving Motor Skill Learning by Dayan D-A-Y-A-N, I
hope I'm not butchering the pronunciation and Cohen, by Leonard Cohen,
but not the Leonard Cohen most of us are familiar with, the musician,
Leonard Cohen. Dayan and Cohen, neuroplasticity subserving motor skill
learning. And this was published in 2011, but there've been a number
of updates and the literature that I've described in other portions of
today's episode come from the more recent literature such as the more
recent 2021 paper. So you have this basic learning session and then a
period of time afterwards in which the brain can rehearse what it just
did. We hear so much about mental rehearsal and we always think about
mental rehearsal as the thing you do before you train or instead of
training. But this is rehearsal that's done afterward where the brain
is just automatically scripting through the sequence. And for some
reason, that's still not clear as to why this would be the case it
runs backward. Then in sleep, it runs forwards and certainly
absolutely, sleep and quality sleep of the appropriate duration, et
cetera is going to be important for learning of all kinds, including
skill learning. We did an entire four episodes on sleep and how to get
better at sleeping. Those are the episodes back in January episodes,
essentially one, two, three, and four and maybe even episode five, I
don't recall. But you can go there to find out all about how to get
better at sleeping. Now there are other training sessions involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=3228"&gt;Leveraging Uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to learn the perfect golf swing or the tennis serve or
how to dance in one session and I doubt you will either. So the
question is when to come back and what to do when you come back to the
training set. Now, first of all, this principle of errors queuing
attention and opening the opportunity for plasticity, that's never
going to change. That's going to be true for somebody who is hyper
skilled who's even has mastery or even virtuosity in a given skill.
Remember, when you're unskilled at something, uncertainty is very
high. As you become more skilled, certainty goes up. Then eventually
you achieve levels of mastery where certainty is very very high about
your ability to perform, yours certainty en that of other people. And
then there's this fourth category of virtuosity where somebody, maybe
you invites uncertainty back into the practice because only with that
uncertainty, can you express your full range of abilities which you
aren't even aware of until uncertainty comes into the picture. I
happened to have the great privilege of being friends with Laird
Hamilton, the big wave surfer who's phenomenal. I don't surf, I
certainly don't surf with Laird, but he, and another guy that he
starts with Luca Patua, these guys, they're virtuosos at surfing. They
don't just want the wave that they can master, they want uncertainty.
They're at the point in their practice where when uncertainty shows up
like a wave that's either so big or is moving in a particular way that
it brings an element of uncertainty for them about what they're going
to do that they recognize that as the opportunity to perform better
than they would otherwise. So they're actually trying to eliminate
uncertainty. At the beginning of learning any skill and as we approach
from uncertain to skilled to mastery, we want to reduce uncertainty.
And that's really what the nervous system is doing, it's trying to
eliminate errors and hone in on the correct trajectories. If you
perform a lot of repetitions and then you use a period immediately
after, we don't really have a name for this, maybe someone will come
up with it and put it in the comment section if you're on YouTube, if
you're watching this on YouTube, a name for this post learning kind of
idle time for the brain. The brain is an idol at all, it's actually
scripting all these things in reverse that allow for deeper learning
and more quick learning. But if we fill that with other things, if we
are focused on our phones or we're focused on learning something else,
we're focusing on our performance, that's not going to serve us well,
it's at least it's not going to serve the skill learning well. So
please, if you're interested in more rapid skill learning try
introducing these sessions, they can be quite powerful. And then on
subsequent sessions, presumably after a night's sleep or maybe you're
doing two sessions a day, although two sessions a day is going to be a
lot for most people, unless you're a professional or a high-level
athlete, the subsequent sessions are where you get to express the
gains of the previous session, where you get to perform well,
presumably more often even if it's just subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=3419"&gt;What to Pay Attention To While Striving To Improve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there'll be a decrease in performance, but most often you're
going to perform better on subsequent and subsequent training
sessions. And there is the opportunity to devote attention in very
specific ways, not just let the errors inform you where to place your
attention, but rather to direct your perception to particular elements
of the movement in order to accelerate learning further. So to be very
clear, 'cause I know many of you are interested in concrete protocols.
It's not just that you would only let errors cue your attention on the
first session. You might do that for one session or five sessions, is
going to depend. But once you're familiar with something and you're
performing it well every once in a while, you're accomplishing it
better every once in a while, then you can start to cue your attention
in very deliberate ways. And the question therefore becomes what to
cue your attention to. And the good news is it doesn't matter. There
is a beautiful set of experiments that have been done looking at
sequences of keys being played on a piano. This is work that was
published just a couple of years ago. There are actually several
papers now that are focused on this. One of them was published in
2018. This is from Claudia Lappe and colleagues, L-A-P-P-E. She's done
some really nice work, which talks about the influence of pitch
feedback on learning of motor timing and sequencing. And this was done
with piano but it carries over to athletic performance as well. So I'm
going to describe the study to you, but before I describe it, what is
so interesting about this study that I want you to know about is that
it turns out it doesn't matter so much what you pay attention to
during the learning sequence provided it's something related to the
motor behavior that you're performing. That seems incredible. I'm not
good at a tennis serve. So if I've done let's say a thousand
repetitions of the tennis serve. Maybe I got it right three to 10
times. Now I'm being even more generous with myself. And I do this
post-training session where I let my brain idle and I get some good
sleep and I come back and now I start generating errors again,
presumably or hopefully fewer errors, but I decide I'm going to cue my
attention to something very specific, like maybe how tightly I'm
holding the racket or maybe it's my stance, or maybe it's whether or
not I rotate my right shoulder in as I hit the ball across. And I'm
making this up, again I don't play tennis. Turns out that it as long
as it's the same thing throughout the session, learning is
accelerated. And I'll explain why this make sense in a moment. But
just to be really clear, you can and one should use your powers of
attention to direct your attention to particular aspects of a motor
movement once you're familiar with the general theme of the movement.
But what you pay attention to exactly is not important. What's
important is that you pay attention to one specific thing. So what
Claudia Lappe and colleagues showed was that if people are trying to
learn a sequence of keys on the piano, there are multiple forms of
feedback. There are error signals if for instance, they hear a piece
of music and then they're told to press the keys in a particular
sequence and the noise that comes out, the sound that comes out of the
piano does not sound like the song they just heard. So instead of, and
here, forgive me because I'm neither musical, nor can I sing. But
instead of dah, dah dah, dah, they hear that, dah, dah dah, dah and
then instead when they play. If it were me, it sounds something like,
dah, dah dah [indistinct], it wouldn't sound right. It wouldn't sound
right, because I likely got the sequence wrong, or I was pressing too
hard on the keys or too lightly on the keys, et cetera. What they
showed was if they just instruct people about the correct sequence to
press on the keys, it actually doesn't matter what sound comes back,
provided it's the correct sound or it's the same sound. All right, so
here's the experiment. They had people press on these keys and it was
a typical piano and it generated the particular sequence of sounds
that would be generated by pressing the keys on the piano. Or they
modified the keyboard in this case or piano such that when people
pressed on the keys, a random tone different tones were played each
time they pressed on the keys. So it sounded crazy, it sounded like
noise, but the motor sequence was the same. Or they had a single tone
that was played every time they pressed a key and the job or the task
of the subject was just oppressed the keys in the proper sequence. So
instead of dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, it it was just dunt, dunt,
dunt, dunt, dunt. Instead of dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, it's dah,
dah, dah, dah, dah. It's even hard for me to say it in even a tone,
but you get the idea. So a singular tone, just think a doorbell being
rung with each press of the key will be really annoying. But it turns
out that the rate to motor learning was the same, whether or not they
were getting feedback that was accurate to the keys of the piano or
whether or not it was a constant tone. Performance was terrible and
the rates of learning were terrible if they were getting random tones
back. So what this means is that learning to play the piano at least
at these early stages is really just about generating the motor
commands. It's not about paying attention to the sound that's coming
out of the piano. And this makes sense because when we are beginners,
we are trying to focus our attention on the things that we can
control. And if you think about this, if you conceptualize this,
pressing the keys on the piano and paying attention to the sounds that
are coming out are two things. So what this means is that as you get
deeper and deeper into a practice, focusing purely on the motor
execution can be beneficial. Now, this is going to be harder to do
with open loop type things where you're getting feedback. I guess a
good example of open loop would be the attempt at a back flip. If you
get it wrong, you will immediately know, if you get it right, you'll
immediately know. Please don't go out and try and do a back flip on
the solid ground, or even on a trampoline if you don't know what
you're doing because very likely you'll get it wrong and you'll get
injured. But if it's something that is closed loop where you can
repeat again and again, and again and again, that is advantageous
because you can perform many many repetitions and you can start to
focus or learn to focus your attention just on the pattern of
movement. In other words, you can learn to play the piano just as fast
or maybe even faster by just focusing on the sequence that you are
moving your digits, your fingers and not the feedback. Now, I'm sure
there are music teachers out there and piano teachers that are
screaming, "No you're going to ruin the practice "that all of us have
embedded in our minds "and in our students." And I agree, at some
point you need to start including feedback about whether or not things
sound correct. But one of the beauties of skill learning is that you
can choose to parameterize it, meaning you can choose to just focus on
the motor sequence or just focus on the sounds that are coming back
and then integrate those. And so we hear a lot about chunking, about
breaking things down into their component parts. But one of the
biggest challenges for skill learning is knowing where to place your
attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=3885"&gt;Protocol Synthesis Part One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to dial out again, we're building a protocol across this episode,
early sessions, maybe it's the first one, maybe it's the first 10,
maybe it's the first 100. It depends on how many repetitions you're
packing in. But during those initial sessions, the key is to make many
errors to let the reward process govern the plasticity, let the errors
open the plasticity. And then after the learning sessions, to let the
brain go idle at least for a short period of time and of course, to
maximize sleep. As you start incorporating more sessions, you start to
gain some skill level, learning to harness and focus your attention on
particular features of the movement independent of the rewards and the
feedback. So the reward is no longer in the tone coming from the piano
or whether or not you struck the target correctly but simply the motor
movement focusing your, for instance in a dart throw, on the action of
your arm. That is embedding the plasticity in the motor pattern most
deeply, that's what's been shown by the scientific literature. I'm
sure there are coaches and teachers out there that will entirely
disagree with me and that's great. Please let me know what you prefer,
let me know where you think this is wrong and it rarely happens, but
let me know where you think this might be right as well. So we're
breaking the learning process down into its component parts. As we get
more and more skilled, meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors per a
given session per unit time, that's when attention can start to
migrate from one feature such as the motor sequence to another feature
which is perhaps one's stance and another sequence, component of the
sequence, which would be the result that's one getting on a trial to
trial basis. So changing it up each time. So maybe I served the tennis
ball and I'm focusing on where the ball lands and then I'm focusing on
the speed, then I'm focusing on my grip, then I'm focusing on my
stance from trial to trial. But until we've mastered the core motor
movements which has done session to session, that at least according
to the literature that I have access to here, seems to be suboptimal.
So hopefully this is starting to make sense, which is that these
connections between upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons and
central pattern generators, you can't attack them all at once. You
can't try and change them all at once. And so what we're doing is
we're breaking things down into their component parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=4030"&gt;Super-Slow-Motion Learning Training: Only Useful After Some Proficiency Is Attained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be wondering about speed of movement. There are some
data, meaning some decent papers out there showing that ultra slow
movements, performing a movement essentially in slow motion can be
beneficial for enhancing the rate of skill learning. However, at least
from my read of the literature, it appears that ultra slow movements
should be performed after some degree of proficiency has already been
gained in that particular movement. Now that's not the way I would
have thought about it. I would have thought, well, if you're learning
how to do a proper kick or a paunch in martial arts or something that
ultra slow movements at first are going to be the way that one can
best learn how to perform a movement and then you just gradually
increase the speed. It turns out that's not the case and I probably
should have known that. And you should probably know that because it
turns out that when you do ultra slow movements, two things aren't
available to you. One is the proprioceptive feedback is not accurate
because of fast movements of limbs are very different than slow
movements of limbs. So you don't get the opportunity to build in the
proprioceptive feedback. But the other reason why it doesn't work is
that it's too accurate, you don't generate errors. And so the data
that I was able to find show that very slow movements can be
beneficial if one is already proficient in a practice, but very slow
movements at the beginning don't allow you to learn more quickly
because you never generate errors and therefore the brain doesn't,
it's not open for change. The window for plasticity has never swung
open, so to speak. So it brings us back to this theme that errors
allow for plasticity, correct performance of movements or semi correct
performance of movements, cues the synapses in the brain areas and
spinal circuits that need to change. And then those changes occur in
the period immediately after skill learning and in sleep. So super
slow movements can be beneficial once you already have some
proficiencies. So this might be standing in your living room and just
in ultra slow motion, performing your tennis serve, learning to, or
thinking about how you're adjusting your elbow and your arm and the
trajectory exactly how you were taught by your tennis coach. But
trying to learn it that way from the outset does not appear to be the
best way to learn a skill. When should you start to introduce slow
learning? Well, obviously talk to your coaches about this, but if
you're doing this recreationally or you don't have a coach, I realize
many of you don't. I don't have a coach for anything that I do. I'm
going to have just navigating it by using the scientific literature.
It appears that once you're hitting success rates of about 25 or 30%,
that's where the super slow movements can start to be beneficial. But
if you're still performing things at a rate of five or 10% correct and
the rest are errors, then the super slow movements are probably not
going to benefit you that much. Also super slow movements are not
really applicable to a lot of things. For instance, you could imagine
throwing a dart super slow motion, but if you actually try and throw
an actual dart, the dart's just going to fall to the floor, obviously.
So there are a number of things like baseball bat swing which you can
practice in super slow motion. But if you try and do that with an
actual baseball or softball or something like that, that's not going
to give you any kind of feedback about how effective it was. So super
slow movements or a decelerated movement has its place but once you're
already performing things reasonably well like maybe 25 to 30% success
rate. And I've tried this, I actually, I struggle with basketball for
whatever reason and my free throw is terrible. So I practiced free
throws in super slow motion and I nailed them every time, the problem
is there's no ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=4266"&gt;How To Move From Intermediate To Advanced Skill Execution faster: Metronomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you already have a fair degree of proficiency, of skill in a
given practice or sport or instrument. And if you're in this sort of
advanced intermediate or advanced levels of proficiency for something,
there is a practice that you can find interesting data for in the
literature, which involves metronoming. So this you'll realize relates
to generating repetitions and it relates to the tone experiment where
it doesn't really matter what your attention is cued to as long as you
are performing many many reps of the motor sequence. You can use a
metronome and obviously musicians do this, but athletes can do this
too. You can use a metronome to set the cadence of your repetitions.
Now for swimmers, there's actually a device. I was able to find
online, I forgot what the brand name was and that's not what this is
about, but that actually goes in the swim cap that can cue you to when
you need to perform another stroke. And for runners, there are other
metronome type devices that through headphones or through a tone in
the room if you're running indoors or on a treadmill we'll cue you to
when you basically you need to lift your heels. And if you do that,
what athletes find is they can perform more repetitions, they can
generate more output, you can increase speed. A number of really
interesting things are being done with auditory metronoming. And then
I'm involved in a little bit of work now that hopefully I'll be able
to report back to you about using stroboscopic metronoming. So
actually changing the speed of the visual environment. These are fun
experiments, basically changing one's perception of how fast they're
moving through space by playing with the visual system, something for
a future discussion. But you can start to use auditory metronoming for
generating more movements per unit time and generating more errors and
therefore more successes and more neuroplasticity. There are a number
of different apps out there. I found several free apps where you can
set in a metronome pace, or it might be tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick. That's a little fast for most things, but you can imagine if
this were darts or this were golf swings that it might be tick, tick,
tick, tick or something more like tick, tick. And every time the
metronome goes, you swing. Every time the metronome goes, you throw a
dart. Actually there's some wild experiments out there. You know
there's a world championship of cup stacking. There's a young lady who
I saw could take all these cups spread out on a table and basically
just stack them into the perfect pyramid in the least amount of times
and all the kids go wild. This is something I'd never thought to
pursue and frankly never will pursue unless my life depends on it for
some reason, but it's really impressive. And if you look at the
sequence 'cause these have been recorded, you can look this up on
YouTube. What you'll find is that these expert cup stackers, it's just
all about error elimination. But they're two metronomic and auditory
cues can actually cue them to pick up the cups faster than they would
ordinarily and to learn to do that. You can do this for anything. I
think cup stacking is probably not a skill most of you are interested
in doing, but for any skill, if you figure out at what rate you are
performing repetitions per unit time and you want to increase that
slightly, you set a metronome which is slightly faster than your
current rate and you just start generating more repetitions. Now
what's interesting about this and is cool is it relates back to the
experiment from Lappe and colleagues, which is your attention is now
harnessed to the tone, to the metronome, not necessarily to what
you're doing in terms of the motor movement. And so really you need a
bit of proficiency. Again, this is for people who are in intermediate
or advanced intermediate or advanced. But what you're essentially
doing is you're creating an outside pressure, a contingency so that
you generate, again, more errors. So it's all about the errors that
you get. Now, these aren't errors where all the cups tumble or you
have to stop or you can't keep up, you have to set the pace just a
little bit beyond what you currently can do. And when you do that,
you're essentially forcing the nervous system to make errors and
correct the errors inside of the session. I find this really
interesting because what it means is, again you've got sensory
perception, what you're paying attention to, proprioception where your
limbs are and the motor neurons in your upper lower motor neurons and
central pattern generators. And you can't pay attention to, "Well,
they're my upper motor neurons, "they're my lower motor neurons."
Forget that, you're not going to do that. You can't pay attention to
your proprioception too much. That would be the super slow motion
would be the proprioception. But you have to harness your attention to
something. And if you harness your attention to this outside
contingency, this metronome that's firing off and saying, now go, now
go, now go. Not only can you increase the number of repetitions,
errors and successes, but for some reason and we don't know why, the
regular cadence of the tone of the metronome and the fact that you are
anchoring your movements to some external force, to some external
pressure or cue seems to accelerate the plasticity and the changes and
the acquisition of skills beyond what it would be if you just did the
same number of repetitions without that outside pressure. We don't
know exactly what the mechanism is. Presumably it's neurochemical,
like there's something about keeping up with a timer or with a pace
that presumably and I'm speculating here, causes the release of
particular chemicals. But I think it's really cool. Metronomes,
they're totally inexpensive, at least the ones that you use outside of
water are very inexpensive. You can find these free apps, you can use
a musical metronome. So metronomes are a powerful tool as well in
particular for speed work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=4604"&gt;Increasing Speed Even If It Means More Errors: Training Central Pattern Generators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for sprinting or swimming or running where the goal is to generate
more strokes or more efficient strokes or more steps, et cetera. The
rate of the metronome obviously is going to be very important.
Sometimes you're trying to lengthen your stride, sometimes you're
trying to take fewer strokes but glide further in the pool for
instance. But the value of occasionally just the number of
repetitions, the number of strokes or steps, et cetera per unit time
is also that you're training the central pattern generators to operate
at that higher speed. One of the sports has kind of interesting to me
is speed walking. It's not one I engage in or ever planned to engage
in, but if you've ever tried to really speed walk, it's actually
difficult to walk very very fast without breaking into a run. All
animals have these kinds of crossover points where you go. I think
with horses it's like it was that they trot, then they gallop on, or
what's the next thing. Clearly, I don't know anything about horses
except that they're beautiful and I liked them very much. But they
break into a different kind of stride. And that's because you shift
over to different central pattern generators. So when you're walking
or a horse is moving very slowly and then it breaks into a jog and
then into a full sprint or gallop for the horse, you're actually
engaging different central pattern generators. And those central
pattern generators always have a range of speeds that they're happiest
to function at. So with the metronoming for speed purposes, what you
do is you can basically bring the activity of those central pattern
generators into their upper range and maybe even extend their range.
And there's a fascinating biology of how central pattern generators
work together. There's coupling of central pattern generators, et
cetera in order to achieve maximum speeds and et cetera. It's a topic
for a kind of an advanced session. Costa loves this topic, he just
barked. And he loves it so much, he barked again. In any event, the
metronome is a powerful tool, again for more advanced practitioners or
for advanced intermediate practitioners. But it's interesting because
it brings back the point that what we put our attention to while we're
still learning is important to the extent that it's on one thing at
least for the moment or trial to trial, but that what we focus our
attention on can be external, it can be internal and ultimately the
skill learning is where all that is brought together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=4752"&gt;Integrated Learning: Leveraging Your Cerebellum (“Mini-Brain”)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about where skill learning occurs in the nervous system.
And then I'm going to give you a really, what I think is a really cool
tool that can increase flexibility and range of motion based on this
particular brain area. It's a tool that I used and when I first heard
about, I did not believe would work. This is not a hack, this is
actually anchored deeply in the biology of a particular brain region
that we all have whose meaning is mini brain. And that mini brain that
we all have is called your cerebellum. The cerebellum is called the
mini brain because it's in the back of your brain. It looks like a
little mini version of the rest of your brain. It's an absolutely
incredible structure that's involved in movement. It also has a lot of
non-movement associated functions. In brief, the cerebellum gets input
from your senses, particularly, your eyes and pays attention to where
your eyes are in space, what you're looking at. It basically takes
information about three aspects of your eyes and eye movements which
are occurring when your head goes like this, which is called pitch. So
this is pitch. For those of you that are listening I'm just nodding up
and down then there's yaw, which is like shaking your head, no, from
side to side. And then there's roll, which is that like sometimes if
you see a primate, like a Marmoset or something, they will roll their
head when they look at you. Actually, the reason they do that is it
helps generate depth perception, it's a kind of form of motion
parallax if you're curious why they do that. It's not to look cute,
they do it because when they do that, even if you're stationary and
they're stationary, they get better depth perception as to how far
away from them you are. So you've got pitch, yaw and roll. And as you
move your head and as you move your body and you move through space,
the image on your retina moves, pitch, yaw on roll in some
combination, that information is relayed to your cerebellum. So it's
rich with visual information. There's also a map of your body surface
and your movements and timing in the cerebellum. So it's an incredible
structure that brings together timing of movements, which limbs are
moving and has proprioceptive information. It really is a mini brain,
it's just the coolest little structure back there. And in humans, it's
actually not that little, it's just an incredible structure. Now, all
this information is integrated there, but what most people don't tell
us is that a lot of learning of motor sequences of skill learning that
involves timing occurs in the cerebellum. Now, you can't really use
that information except to know that after you learn something pretty
well, it's handed off or kind of handled by your cerebellum, but there
is something that you can do with your cerebellum to increase range of
motion and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=4922"&gt;Protocol For Increasing Limb Range of Motion, Immediately&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of our flexibility, believe it or not is not because our tendons
are particular length or a elasticity, although that plays some role,
it's not because our muscles are short. I don't know what that would
even mean. Some people have longer muscle bellies or shorter muscle
bellies, but your muscles always essentially span the entire length of
the bone or limb or close to it, along with your tendons. But has to
do with the neural innervation of muscle and the fact that when
muscles are elongated, there's a point at which they won't stretch out
any longer and the nerves fire, and they shut down that you actually
have inhibitory pathways that prevent you from contracting the muscles
or from extending them, from stretching them out any more. So you can
do this right now. If you're driving, don't do it because unless you
have a self-driving car, you'll need to take your hands off the
steering. But because of the way that vision and your muscles are
represented in your cerebellum, it turns out that your range of visual
motion and your range of vision, literally how wide a field of view
you take impacts how far you can extend your limbs. So we'll talk
about this in a second exactly how to do this and explore this. But as
you move through space, as you walk forward or you walk backward, or
you tilt your head or you learn a skill, or you just operate in the
normal ways throughout your day, driving, biking, et cetera, your eyes
are generating spontaneous movements to offset visual slip. In other
words, you don't see the world as blurry even though you're moving
because your eyes are generating low compensatory eye movements to
offset your motion. So if I spin, we could do this experiment. There's
a fun experiment we do with medical students where you spin them
around in a chair with their eyes closed and then you stop and you
have them open their eyes and their eyes are going like this, is
nystagmus. I don't suggest you do this experiment. When we were kids,
we did a different experiment which was to take a stick and to look at
the top of the stick and to spin around on the lawn looking at the top
of the stick then put it down on the ground and try and jump over it.
And you ended up like jumping to the side, you miss the thing
entirely. The reason those two "experiments" which I hope you don't do
or for somebody else to do. The reason they work is because normally
your eye movements and your balance and your limb movements are
coordinated. But when you spin around looking up at the stick, what
you're doing is you're fixating your eyes on one location while you're
moving. And then when you stop those two mechanisms are completely
uncoupled and it's like being thrown into outer space. I've never been
to outer space, but probably something like that, low gravity, zero
gravity. If you spin around in your chair with your eyes closed,
you're not giving the visual input that you're spinning. And then you
open the eyes and then the eyes only have what we call the vestibular,
your eyes jolting back and forth, back and forth. Again, these aren't
experiments you need to do 'cause I just told you the result. However,
if you want to extend your range of motion, you can do that by...
These things always look goofy, but at this point I'm just kind of
used to doing these things. If I want to extend my range of movement,
first, I want to measure my range of motion. If you're listening what
I'm doing is I'm stretching out my arms like a T on either side and
I'm trying to push them as far back as I can, which for me feels like
it's in line with my shoulders and I can't get much further. I'm not
really super flexible nor am I particularly inflexible at least
physically. So what I would then do is stop. I would move my eyes to
the far periphery. So I'm moving my eyes all the way to the left while
keeping my head and body stationary. I'm trying to look over my left
shoulder as far as I can then off to the right. It's a little awkward
to do this, then up then down but I'm mostly going to just focus on
left and then right. Now what that's doing is it's sending a signal to
my cerebellum that my field of view is way over to there and way over
to there. Remember your visual attention has an aperture. It can be
narrow, or it can be broad. And I've talked about some of the benefits
of taking a broad visual aperture in order to relax the nervous
system. This is just moving my eyes, not my head, like I just did for
a second, from side to side. Now I can retest. And actually you get
about a five to 15 degree increase in your range of motion. Now I'm
doing this for you. You can say, "Well, he gamed it 'cause he knew
"the result that he was hoping for." But you can try this. And you can
do this for legs too. You can do this for any limb essentially. And
that's it's purely cerebellar. And it's because the proprioceptive
visual and limb movement feedback converge in the ways that we control
our muscle spindles and the way we control the muscle fibers and the
tendons and essentially you can get bigger range of motion. So
actually we'll warm up before exercise or before skill learning by
both doing movements for my body but also moving my eyes from side to
side in order to generate larger range of motion if range of motion is
something that I'm interested in. So that's a fun one that you can
play with a little bit and it's purely cerebellar. Some other time
we'll get back into a cerebellar function. There's all sorts of just
incredible stuff that you can do with cerebellum. I talked in an
earlier episode on neuro-plasticity about how you can disrupt your
vestibular world. In other words, by getting into modes of
acceleration, moving through space where you're tilted in certain
ways, it can open up the windows for plasticity and yet other ways. So
you can check that out, it's one of the earlier episodes on
neuroplasticity everything's timestamped. But meanwhile, if you want
to expand your range of motion before doing skill learning or
afterward, this is a fun one. It's also kind of neat because I have
this kind of aversion to stretching work. It never seems like
something I want to do and so I always put it off. So if I start with
the visual practice of expanding my field of view to off to one side
or the other side or up or down, then what I find is I'm naturally
more flexible. I'm not naturally more flexible. What's happened is
I've expanded my range of motion. Let's talk about visualization and
mental rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=5310"&gt;Visualization/ Mental Rehearsal: How To Do It Correctly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been asked about this a lot, and I think it relates back to that
kind of matrix Hollywood idea that we can just be embedded with a
skill. Although in this case, in fairness, visualization involves some
work. And I've talked about this on an earlier episode that some
people find it very hard to mentally visualize things. And some people
find it very easy. There was great work that was done in the 1960s by
Roger Shepherd at Stanford and by others, looking at people's ability
to rotate three-dimensional objects in their mind. And some people
really good at this and some people are less good at this. And one can
get better at it by repeating it. But the question we're going to deal
with today is does it help, does it let you learn things faster? And
indeed the answer appears to be yes, it can. However, despite what
you've heard, it is not as good. It is not a total replacement for
physical performance itself. So I'm going to be really concrete about
this. I hear all the time that just imagining contracting a muscle can
lead to the same gains as actually contracting that muscle. Just
imagining a skill can lead to the same increases in performance as
actually executing that skill. And that's simply not the case.
However, it can supplement or support physical training and skill
learning in ways that are quite powerful. One of the more interesting
studies on this was from Rang Ganason at all, forgive me for the
pronunciation. This was a slightly older paper, 2004, but nonetheless
was one that I thought had particularly impressive results and
included all the appropriate controls, et cetera. And what they did is
they looked at 30 subjects. They divide them into different groups.
They had one group perform essentially finger flection. So it actually
sort of the imagine if you're just listening to this, the come here a
finger movement. They also had elbow flection, so bicep curl type
movement. And they either had subjects do a actual physical movement
against resistance, or to imagine moving their finger or their wrist
towards the shoulder, meaning at the bending at the elbow towards
actual resistance. Just to make a long story short, what they found
was that there were increases in this finger, adduction strength,
abduction, excuse me, strength of about 35% and the elbow flection
strength by about 13.5%, which are pretty impressive considering that
was just done mentally. So they had people imagine moving against a
weight, a very heavyweight or had imagined people moving their wrist
towards their shoulder against a very heavyweight. But again, they
weren't doing it, they were just imagining it. Other experiments
looked at the brain and what was happening in the brain during this
time. So we'll talk about that in a moment. But essentially what they
found were improvements in strength of anywhere from 13.5 to 35%.
However, the actual physical training group, the groups that actually
moved their wrist or moved their finger against an actual physical
weight had improvements of about 53%. So this repeats over and over
throughout the literature mental rehearsal can cause increases in
strength. It can create increases in skill acquisition and learning,
but they are never as great if done alone as compared to the actual
physical execution of those movements or the physical movement of
those weights, which shouldn't come as so surprising. However, if we
step back and we say, "Well, what is the source of this improvement?"
You might not care what the source is because I could tell you it's
one brain area or another brain area. What difference would it make?
But again, if you can understand mechanism a little bit, you're in a
position to create newer and even better protocols. What mental
rehearsal appears to do is engage the activity of those upper motor
neurons that we talked about way back at the beginning of the episode.
Remember you have upper motor neurons that control deliberate action,
you've got lower motor neurons that actually connect to the muscles
and move those muscles and you have central pattern generators. Mental
rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically and thinking about a
particular sequence of movement and visualizing it in one's "mind's
eye" creates activation of the upper motor neurons that's very similar
if not the same as the actual movement. And that makes sense because
the upper motor neurons are all about the command for movement. They
are not the ones that actually execute the movement. Remember, upper
motor neurons are the ones that generate the command for movement, not
the actual movement. The ones that generate the actual movement are
the lower motor neurons and the central pattern generators. So
visualization is a powerful tool. How can you use visualization? Well,
in this study, they had people perform this five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=5630"&gt;Results From 15 Minutes Per Day, 5 Days Per Week Visualization (vs. Actual Training)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that it was 15. Yes, it was 15 minutes per day, five days a
week for 12 weeks. So that's a lot of mental rehearsal. It's not a ton
of time each day, 15 minutes per day. But sitting down, closing your
eyes and imagining going through a particular skill practice or moving
a weight. Maybe it's playing keys on a piano if that's your thing or
strings on a guitar, for 15 minutes a day, five days per week for 12
weeks is considerable. I think most people, given the fact that the
actual practice, the physical practice is going to lead to larger
improvements, greater improvements then would the mental training
would opt for the actual physical training. But of course, if you're
on a plane and you don't have access to your guitar and you're
certainly not going to be sprinting up and down the aisle or you are
very serious about your craft and you want to accelerate performance
of your craft or strength increases or something of that sort, then
augmenting or adding in the visualization training very likely will
compound the effects of the actual physical training. There are not a
lot of studies looking at how visualization on top of pure physical
training can increase the rates of learning and consolidation of
learning, et cetera. It's actually a hard study to do because hard to
control for because what would you do in its place. You would probably
add actual physical training and then that's always going to lead to
greater effects. So the point is if you want to use visualization
training, great, but forget the idea that visualization training is as
good as the actual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=5734"&gt;Imagining Something Is Very Different Than Actually Experiencing It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hear this all the time. People say, do you know that if you
imagine an experience to your brain and to your body, it's exactly the
same as the actual experience. Absolutely not. This is not the way the
nervous system works. I'm sorry, I don't mean to burst anybody's
bubble, but your bubble is made of myths. And the fact of the matter
is that the brain, when it executes a movement is generating
proprioceptive feedback. And that proprioceptive feedback is
critically involved in generating our sense of the experience and in
things like learning. So I don't say this because I don't like the
idea that visualization couldn't work. In fact visualization does
work, but it doesn't work as well, it doesn't create the same millu,
the same chemical millu, the same environment as actual, physically
engaging in the behavior, the skill the resistance training, et
cetera. And I'd be willing to wager that the same is true for
experiences of all kinds. PTSD is this incredibly unfortunate
circumstance in which there's a replay often of the traumatic event
that feels very real. But that's not to say that the replay itself is
the same as the actual event. And of course, PTSD needs to be dealt
with with the utmost level of seriousness, it should be treated. In
fact, my lab works on these sorts of things, but my point about
visualization and imagining something not being the same as the actual
experience is grounded in this idea of proprioception. And the fact
that feedback to the cerebellum, the cerebellum, talking to other
areas of the brain are critically involved in communicating to the
rest of our nervous system. That not just that we believe something is
happening but something is actually happening. And in the case of
muscle loads, muscles actually feeling tension, the actual feeling of
tension in the muscle. The contracting of the muscle under that
tension is part of the important adaptation process. In a future
episode, we'll talk about hypertrophy and how that works at the level
of upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons and muscle itself. But for
now just know that visualization can work. It doesn't work as well as
real physical training and practice, but these effects of 35% or 13.5%
increases are pretty considerable. They're just not as great as the
53% increases that come from actual physical training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=5878"&gt;Cadence Training &amp;amp; Learning “Carryover”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that are interested in some of this skill learning
that more relates to musical training, but also how cadence and
metronomes and tones, et cetera, can support physical learning. If
you're interested in that, if are you a fussy and autos, there is a
wonderful review, also published in the Journal Neuron again,
excellent journal by Herholz and Zatorre, that's H-E-R-H-O-L-Z and
Zatorre, Z-A-T-O-R-R-E. That really describes in detail how musical
training can impact all sorts of different things and how cadence
training, whether or not with tones or auditory feedback and things of
that sort carries over to not just instrumental music training but
also physical skill learning of various kinds. So if you want to do
the deep dive, that would be the place you can find it easily online.
It's available as a complete article free of charge, et cetera. Many
of you are probably asking what can I take in order to accelerate
skill learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=5940"&gt;Ingestible Compounds That Support Skill Learning: Motivation, Repetitions, Alpha-GPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the conditions are going to vary, but motivation is key. You
have to show up to the training session motivated enough to focus your
attention and to perform a lot of repetitions in the training
sequence. That's just a prerequisite. There's no pill that's going to
allow you to do fewer repetitions and extract more learning out of
fewer repetitions. It's actually more a question of what are the
conditions that you can create for yourself such that you can generate
more repetitions per unit time. I think that's the right way to think
about it. What are the conditions that you can create for yourself in
your mind and in your body that are going to allow you to focus? And
I've talked about focus and plasticity and motivation in previous
episodes. Please see those episodes if you have questions about that.
I've detailed a lot of tools in the underlying science. So for some
people, it might be drinking a cup of coffee and getting hydrated
before the training session. For some of you, it might be avoiding
coffee because it makes you too jittery and your attention jumps all
over the place. It's going to vary tremendously. There is no magic
pill that's going to allow you to get more out of less, that's just
not going to happen. It's simply not going to happen. You're not going
to get more learning out of fewer repetitions or less time. However,
there are a few compounds I think are worth mentioning because of
their ability to improve the actual physical performance, the actual
execution of certain types of movements. And some of these have also
been shown to improve cognitive function, especially in older
population. So I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention them. I'm
only going to mention one today in fact. The one that's particularly
interesting and for which there really are a lot of data is alpha GPC
and I'm going to attempt to pronounce what alpha GPC actually is. It's
alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine. Alpha GPC, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine. See, if I keep doing it over and over
repetitions, alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine. There I made an error.
Okay, so the point is that alpha GPC, which is at least in the United
States is sold over the counter typically is taken in dosages of about
300 to 600 milligrams. That's a single dose or have been shown to do a
number of things that for some of you might be beneficial. One is to
enhance power output. So if you're engaging in something like Shotput
throwing or resistance training or sprinting or something where you
have to generate a lot of power, maybe you're doing rock climbing, but
you're working on a particular aspect of your rock climbing that
involves generating a lot of force, a lot of power. Well then in
theory, alpha GPC could be beneficial to you. For the cognitive
effects, the dosages are much higher up to 1200 milligrams daily
divided into three doses of 400 milligrams is what the studies that I
was able to find show or used. The effects on cognitive decline are
described as notable. Notable, meaning several studies showed a
significant but modest effect on in offsetting cognitive decline, in
particular in older populations and some populations, even with some
reported neuro degeneration. Power output was notable. How notable,
what does that mean, notable? A study noted a 14% increase in power
output. That's pretty substantial, 14%. And if you think about it, but
it wasn't like a doubling or something of that sort. Believe it or
not, the symptoms of Alzheimer's have been shown at least among the
nutraceuticals of which alpha GPC is to significantly improve
cognition in people with Alzheimer's. Now this episode, isn't about
cognitive decline and longevity, we will talk about that, but this is
a so-called another effect of alpha GPC. Fat oxidation is increased by
alpha GPC, growth hormone release is promoted by alpha GPC although to
a small degree. So as you can see, things like alpha GPC in particular
when they are combined with low levels of caffeine can have these
effects of improving power output, can improve growth hormone release,
can improve fat oxidation. All these things in theory can support
skill learning. But what they're really doing is they're adjusting the
foundation upon which you are going to execute these many, many
repetitions. The same thing would be said for caffeine itself. If
that's something that motivates you and gets you out of a chair to
actually do the physical training, then that's something that can
perhaps improve or enhance the rate of skill learning and how well you
retain those skills. Now on a previous episode I talked about,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=6219"&gt;Summary &amp;amp; Sequencing Tools: Reps, Fails, Idle Time, Sleep, Metronome, Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this was the episode on epinephrin on adrenaline. I talked about
how for mental, for cognitive learning, it makes sense to spike
epinephrin, to bump epinephrin levels up adrenaline levels up after
cognitive learning. For physical learning, it appears to be the
opposite that if caffeine is in your practice or if you decide to try
alpha GPC that you would want to do that before the training, take it
before the training use it. Its effect should extend into the
training, presumably throughout, and then afterward if you're thinking
about following some of the protocols that we discussed today, that
you would use some sort of idle time where the brain can replay these
motor sequences in reverse. And then of course, you want to do things
that optimize your sleep. A lot of the questions I get are about how
different protocols and things that I described start to collide with
one another. So let's say for instance, you go to bed at 10:30 and
you're going to do your skill training at 9:30, well, taking a lot of
caffeine then is not going to be a good idea 'cause it's going to
compromise your sleep. So I'm not here to design the perfect schedule
for you because everyone's situation's vary. So the things to optimize
are repetitions, failures, more repetitions, more failures at the
offset of training. Having some idle time that can be straight into
sleep or it could be simply letting the brain just go idle for five to
10 minutes, mean not focusing on anything, not scrolling, social
media, not emailing, not ideally not even talking to somebody just
lying down or sitting quietly with your eyes closed letting those
motor sequences replay. Then we talked about how one can come back for
additional training sessions, use things like metronoming where you're
queuing your attention to some external cue, some stimulus, in this
case, an auditory stimulus most likely and trying to generate more
repetitions per unit time. So again, it's repetitions and errors,
that's key. And then we also talked about some things that you can do
involving cerebellar neurophysiology to extend range of motion if
that's what's limiting for you or to use visualization to augment the
practice or let's say your particular skill involves nice weather and
it's raining or snowing outside and you can't get outside or
thunderstorm, then that's where visualization training might be a good
replacement under those conditions. Or in most cases is going to be
the kind of thing that you're going to want to do in addition to the
actual physical skill or strength training session done, at least in
the study that we described for 15 minutes a day, five days a week
over a period of 10 to 12 weeks or so. So hopefully that makes it
clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ0IBzCjEPk&amp;amp;t=6380"&gt;Density Training: Comparing Ultradian- &amp;amp; Non-Ultradian Training Sessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we've covered a lot of mechanism. We talked so much about the
different motor pathway, central pattern generator. So you now are
armed with a lot of information about how you generate movement. And I
like to think that you're also armed with a lot of information about
how to design protocols that are optimized for you or if you're a
coach, for your trainees in order to optimize their learning of skills
various kinds. Today we focused almost entirely on motor skills,
things like musical skills or physical skills. These have some
overlap, they're partially overlapping with neuroplasticity, for
learning things like languages or math or engineering or neuroscience
for that matter. Before we depart, I just want to make sure that I
return to a concept, which is the ultradian cycle. Ultradian cycles
are these 90 minute cycles that we go through throughout sleep and
wakefulness that are optimal for learning and attention. In the waking
state, they are the stages of sleep in which we have either
predominantly slowey sleep or rem sleep. Some of you who have been
following this podcast for a while might be asking, well should a
physical practice be 90 minutes. That's going to depend because with
physical practices, oftentimes for instance, with strength training,
that might be too long. You're not going to be able to generate enough
force output for it to be worthwhile. For golfing, I don't know. I've
never played golf with all my friends that play golf, they disappear
onto the golf course for many hours. So I know there's a lot of
walking and driving and other stuff, I even hear that somebody carries
your stuff around for you sometimes, not always. But it's going to
differ. A four hour golf game, you're probably not swinging the golf
club for four hours, so it's going to depend. I would say that the
ultradian cycle is not necessarily a good constraint for skill
learning in most cases. And I should say that for those of you that
are short on time or have limited amounts of time, 10 minutes of
maximum repetitions, maximum focus skill learning work is going to be
very beneficial. Whereas two hours of kind of haphazard not really
focused work or where you're not generating very many repetitions
'cause you're doing few repetitions then you're texting on your phone
or pay attention to something else, that's not going to be beneficial.
It's really about the density of training inside of a session. So I
think you should let the... Work toward maximal or near maximum
density of repetitions and failures provided they're failures you can
perform safely in order to accelerate skill learning and don't let
some arbitrary or in this case, the ultradian constraint prevent you
from engaging in that practice. In other words, get the work in, get
as much work done as you can per unit time. And based on the science,
based on things that I've seen, based on things that I'm now involved
in with various communities, you will see the skill improve vastly at
various stages. Sometimes it's a little bit stutter start, it's not
always a linear improvement but you will see incredible improvement in
skill. If you're enjoying this podcast&lt;/p&gt;

There, you can support us at any level that you like. In previous
episodes and in this episode, I mentioned some supplements.
Supplements certainly have their place for various things. They aren't
necessary, but many people, including myself derive benefit from
supplements for things like improving sleep and immune system function
and learning and so forth. If you're interested in seeing the
supplements that I take, you can go to thorne.com/u, that's the letter

accessing the Thorne webpage through that portal, as well as 20% off
any of the other supplements that Thorne makes. The reason we've
partnered with Thorne is because Thorne has the very highest levels of
stringency in terms of the quality of the supplements and the accuracy
about the amounts of each supplement that are in the bottle. One of
the major problems in the supplement industry is that when supplements
get tested, often it's the case that the amount of a given ingredient
is far lower or far greater than what's reported on the bottle. That's
not the case for Thorne. Thorne has very high levels of stringency,
they partnered with the Mayo Clinic and all the major sports teams and
that's why we partnered with them as well. So if you want to check

not least, I want to thank you for your time and attention. I very
much appreciate your interest in neuroscience and in physiology and in
tools that are informed by neuroscience and physiology. Today, we
talked all about skill learning. I hope that you'll consider the
information, you might even decide to try some of these tools. If you
do, please let us know your results with them. Give us feedback in the

how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of

the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be
inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives. Finally, I

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles
at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring you
zero cost to consumer information about science and science related
tools to the general public. And keeping with that theme, I'd like to
thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is
InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that
analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand
your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a
believer in getting regular blood tests and the simple reason for that
is that so many of the factors that impact our immediate and longterm
health and wellbeing can only be analyzed from blood. And now with the
advent of modern DNA tests, you can get additional layers of
information that can really support your understanding about what's
going on deep under the hood, so to speak inside your body and brain
and what to do about it. And I think that's really where InsideTracker
sets itself apart from other similar tests. What InsideTracker offers
is, first of all, they make the tests very easy. They can come to your
home to take your blood and DNA test or you can go to a testing center
nearby you. Then you get the information back and rather than just
getting information about whether or not the levels of various things
are high or low, you also get to find out what to do about it. So it
offers directives related to nutrition, to exercise and so forth. It's
really allow you to be in control of your overall health, both where
you are now and its long-term trajectory. With InsideTracker, they
also have something which is it can give you a readout of your inner
age. They have something called the inner age test that really
compares your biological age to your chronological age, something
that's of extreme importance and interest because it has to do with
lifespan or predicted lifespan. If you'd like to try InsideTracker you
can visit insidetracker.com/huberman and if you do that, you'll get
25% off any of InsideTracker plans. Use the code Huberman at checkout.

episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep is a company
that makes mattresses and pillows ideally suited to your sleep needs.
I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress for the last six months, and I
can honestly say it's the best sleep that I've ever gotten. Helix
Sleep has a quiz that can match you to the ideal mattress and pillows
for you. It's a quiz that takes just about two minutes, asks you
questions like do you tend to sleep on your side or your back on your
stomach? Or maybe you don't know, whether or not you tend to wake up
feeling too warm or too cold? Various questions about your sleep
habits. At the end of that quiz, it matches you to a specific mattress
that's perfect for your sleep needs. For me, it matched me to the
dusk, D-U-S-K because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm nor too
soft and I really love the mattress. As I mentioned, I've been
sleeping terrifically well ever since I got that mattress. If you're
interested in upgrading your mattress you can go to
helixsleep.com/huberman, take their two minutes sleep quiz and they'll
match you to a customized mattress and then you'll get up to $200 off
all mattresses and you'll get two free pillows. They have a 10 year
warranty. You get to try it out for a hundred nights, risk-free, if
you don't like it, they'll even pick it up for free, take it away but
I really think you will, I certainly love mine. Again, if you're
interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off
and two free pillows. Today's episode is also brought to us by
Theragun. Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device that
releases deep muscle tension. I first learned about Theragun on a lab
expedition. We're actually headed out to ocean where we were doing
diving with great white sharks, filming those for our VR fear
experiments in the laboratory and it was very long days of carrying
Pelican cases, those are cases these hard plastic cases with
equipment, it was diving, we were all sore and tired all the time. And
someone had brought along a Theragun. It was the first time I had seen
one and pretty soon that thing was getting passed along and became one
of the more coveted devices on board. Everyone wanted time with this
thing because it was great, you could give yourself a really terrific
massage and get deep into the tissue and relieve soreness. When I got
back, I got a Theragun and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring
the podcast. Whether or not you want to treat your muscles because
they're tense from working out or whether or not you just want to
release stress, it's a terrific tool. Many of you are familiar
probably with professional massages but Theragun is interesting
because you can basically give yourself a deep tissue massage,
anytime, anywhere, it's also very quiet. If you want to try Theragun,
you can try it for 30 days. They start at only $199. You can go to
theragun.com/huberman right now and you can get your gen fourth
Theragun today, that's the one that I use or another one of their
models. That's Theragun.com/huberman to try Theragun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=308"&gt;Physical Performance &amp;amp; Skill Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode marks the beginning of a new topic for the Huberman Lab
Podcast. As many of you already know, we go deep into a particular
topic over four, sometimes even five episodes. We just closed out the
episodes on hormones. Now we are going to talk about how to optimize
physical performance and skill learning. We're going to look deep at
the science behind this as well as specific practices. In fact, today,
you're going to hear about specific tools that you can use to improve
endurance and strength by up to, I'm not making this up, three or four
times your current capacity. This is based on studies that were done
at Stanford and are currently in use by collegiate and professional
teams. If you're not a professional athlete or a serious athlete,
that's okay. The topics, this month and all the information we are
going to cover are going to make you a better recreational exerciser
as well. If you're not an exerciser and you're thinking about getting
into that or if you live in the Northern hemisphere and you're just
thinking about the beach this summer or fat loss, muscle building,
that sort of thing, this month we're going to cover all of that as
well. There's so much confusion out there about how to optimize fat
loss, muscle building, improvements in flexibility, for instance, or
skill learning. I know many of you, aren't so focused on the cosmetic
aspects of physical exercise but are interested in actual skill
learning, we're going to talk about that too. I want to just take a
moment to reflect on something that came up last episode. If you
didn't see that episode, that's quite all right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=400"&gt;Optimal Learning Protocol (Recap): 4 Steps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last episode, we were talking about the hormones, adrenaline, and
cortisol and how to leverage those towards attention and learning and
there was a little bit of confusion that I want to clarify. I
mentioned an optimal protocol for learning that involves leveraging
adrenaline also called epinephrin and it involved four steps. The four
steps that I spelled out were to be calm and focused while one is
trying to acquire or learn the new skill, cognitive skill or motor
skill, then to have a spike in adrenaline. I mentioned ways to do
that, using cold or breathing or other tools, immediately after the
learning episode then to incorporate what I call non sleep deep rest,
a 20 minute episode of a shallow nap or some other protocol like NSDR,
non sleep deep rest protocol of which we always provide links in the
captions. And then to try and optimize sleep later that night and the
subsequent night. Some of you heard this and it sunk in right away and
it was straight forward. Others said, wait, I thought from a previous
episode even before that, you said you're supposed to do non sleep
deep rest immediately after learning, no. We added another step, the
logic still follows that you want to be calm and focused during
learning, then you want to spike adrenaline at the end. Most people
get that backward, they're drinking too much coffee or even taking
nootropics and things, trying to be really focused while learning.
Some people are taking Adderall recreationally something I don't
recommend, that's actually getting the whole process backwards if you
look at the data in the physiology. You want to spike adrenaline at
the end or immediately after a learning episode and then non sleep
deep rest and then sleep itself, okay? Four steps, hope that clarifies
things for you, if you have any additional questions please put them
in the comment section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=511"&gt;Variables Impacting Physical Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so let's talk about physical performance. There are so many
variables to physical performance and we can manage physical
performance and skill learning from a variety of contexts. I made just
a short list of some of the things that come to mind that can
powerfully impact physical performance and skill learning. Some of
them are what I would consider foundational. They allow you to show up
your current ability and if you were to disrupt those, you would
perform less well. So things like getting a good night's sleep, things
like being properly hydrated, things like being well nourished,
whatever that means to you. I know some of you like to exercise
fasted, some of you prefer to have food in your stomach or have eaten
a couple hours before. There are supplements, there are drugs, there
are different ways to breathe, there are so many tools related to
mindset, visualization, there are machines and devices, it's just a
vast space, but it's not infinite. And there are a few things in the
list of things that can impact and even optimize physical performance
and skill learning that have an outsized effect that any of you can
use. Many of them, most of them are low to zero costs. So today we are
going to focus on what I believe to be one of the most powerful tools
to improve physical performance and skill learning and recovery and
we'll talk about why that's important and that's temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=600"&gt;Temperature Is the Dominant Variable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now many of you might think, oh, well that's kind of boring, I want to
know about the magic pill that I can take that's going to allow me to
dunk a basketball if I currently can't or I want to know about the
thing that's going to let me run further and faster is going to shed
fat. Believe it or not, temperature is the most powerful variable for
improving physical performance and for recovery. I would argue it's
even more important than sleep because temperature itself is going to
dictate how well and when you sleep and the depth of your total
recovery. There are two aspects to temperature of course, there's heat
and there's cold. We are mainly going to focus on cold as a way to
buffer heat. In a previous podcast episode, I talked all about growth
hormone. You can find that episode about fibroid and growth hormone
and how heat can be a powerful stimulus for increasing growth hormone
which is involved in tissue repair and et cetera and burn fat and
improve metabolism in various ways. However, cold I would argue is
even more powerful than heat as a tool and I'm not just talking about
putting ice packs on sore muscles or slightly sprained limbs and
ankles and things of that sort. We're going to talk about cold from
the standpoint of thermal physiology. This is a literature that's rich
in scientific information that goes back very deep into the last
century where physiologists and neuroscientists figured out that there
are different compartments in your body that heat and cool you
differently and that you can leverage those in order to double and as
I mentioned before even triple or quadruple your work output both
strength, repetitions, and endurance. So this is not weak sauces that
they say, this is the stuff that can really shift the needle quite a
bit and it's not just about well once, it's about being able to
perform well and recover from that performance so that you do even
better when you're not incorporating these tools on days where for
instance, you can't access cold or an ice pack or an ice bath or
things of that sort, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=728"&gt;Understanding Mechanism Is Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're going to cover cold, we're going to talk a little bit about
the physiology of cold and heat and how they work because as you've
probably heard me say before if you can understand some mechanism, if
you can just push yourself through a little bit of new knowledge, into
understanding a little bit of mechanism about how you work, you'll be
in a far better position to implement the tools in the best and most
flexible ways for your needs. This is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,
I never ever do a just list of the things that you should do. I don't
believe in that, just tell me what to do. First, I tell you why you
should do something. What's the logical framework that it's grounded
in and then we distill that down to specific protocols. For those of
you that are too impatient for that, there are millions, if not
billions of other resources out there that will take you into the cul-
de-sac of one protocol that will work and then stop working or might
work for you indefinitely, that's not how we work here. This is about
really understanding the mechanism so that you can tweak things and
modify things, adjust the timing and the dosage of things and really
get the most out of these tools and protocols. Everything I'm going to
talk about pertains to both endurance exercise and strength and speed
type exercise. So sprints, weightlifting, endurance work and to some
extent, flexibility but we're going to cover flexibility in depth as
well as another feature that's not often talked about which is
suppleness or smoothness of movement over different ranges of movement
in a subsequent episode. Let's start by talking about temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=822"&gt;Heat: The Enemy of All Performance (&amp;amp; Why)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is temperature? How does temperature impact the body and its
ability to perform, including learn new skills? So everyone probably
remembers, or has at least heard of the word homeostasis, right? That
the body wants to remain in a particular range of temperatures, that
it doesn't like to be too hot or too cold. And I want to emphasize
from the outset that there are many mechanisms that are installed into
us by way of our evolutionary design and our genome meaning we were
just born with this stuff ready to keep our body temperature in a
particular narrow range. Heating up too much is just plain bad. It's
not just bad for physical performance, it's bad for all tissue health.
If your brain heats up too much, neurons start dying and those neurons
don't come back, okay? You may have heard about neurogenesis, the
ability for the brain to regenerate itself or generate new neurons and
adulthood, there's very little neurogenesis excuse me, in adulthood,
even after anytime after puberty really and you don't want to lose
neurons in the central nervous system. If you get too hot, that'll
happen. It's called hyperthermia, you want to avoid hyperthermia and
you have many mechanisms that are built into you to avoid becoming
hyperthermic. The other thing that happens when we get too warm is
that we have in all of our cells, what are called enzymes. You
generally know if something's an enzyme because it ends in the
letters, A-S-E, right? So lipase is an enzyme that exists to digest
fats. You have proteases that are there to digest proteins, right? So
anytime you see A-S-E chances are it's an enzyme. Enzymes are
proteins, and they have a particular structure and their structure
becomes modified when heat increases and that's not good. You want
their structure to be of a particular type. Imagine a car with four
wheels, let's just say the car is the enzyme. If it gets too hot, it's
like two of the wheels fall off and that thing can't function. So one
of the reasons why the body and nature goes through so much effort to
build in mechanisms to make sure that we don't become too warm is
because when we get to warm, these enzymes don't function, cells stop
functioning, they stop being able to generate energy, they stop being
able to digest things, you stop being able to think and eventually
those cells start dying off entirely. So keeping temperature in a
particular range is really good, you don't want to get too hot. We
have much more flexibility in terms of getting cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=990"&gt;Blood Flow &amp;amp; Sweating &amp;amp; Piloerection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you don't want to become hypothermic either. You can die from
hypothermia just like you can die from hyperthermia. However that you
have a lot more range to be cold than you do to be too warm, okay? And
in general, the idea is to keep the body and brain in a particular
range but anytime we do anything, our body temperature can shift. So
for instance, if you were to stand next to a campfire or you were
outside on a hot day, various things would happen to dump heat from
your body. If you were outside on a cold day or you were to get into a
cold shower or a cold lake, various things would happen to insulate
heat within your body. This is all pretty straightforward and obvious
I realize. Now, what are those things? Well, there are a huge category
of them. When you get into cold water, you secrete adrenaline. On a
hot day, if it's really hot or in a very hot sauna or in the hot
desert, you will generate what are called heat shock proteins which
will set off other sets of cascades, metabolic cascades, biological
cascades. But the simplest way to think about this process is that
when we get cold, we tend to vasoconstrict. Our blood vessels tend to
constrict and we tend to push energy toward the core of our body to
preserve our core organs, okay? So our periphery, our hands and our
feet and our toes and our legs become colder and our core therefore
can maintain blood to that area and we are insulating our core.
Conversely, when we heat up our blood vessels vasodilate, they expand
a bit and more blood flows to our periphery and more blood can move
throughout the body generally and we will perspire, we will sweat,
water will actually get pulled out of the blood to some extent, moved
up through sweat glands and will be brought to the skin surface so
that it can be dumped, we are dumping heat. Animals, as you know vary
in their capacity to sweat. Some animals like camels won't start
sweating at first if they heat up, what they'll do is they'll spit,
they'll dump heat by spitting, okay? Dogs pant, Castilla is off to my
left here, he pants when he gets too warm, he can't sweat or dogs can
maybe sweat a little bit. But we can sweat and you've probably noticed
that on a humid hot day, you'll feel much warmer just walking or
running than you would with the equivalent exercise or movement than
you would on a cold day. And some of you probably know this, but if
you don't the reason is you sweat on a cold day, but because the air
is dry typically, you will bring that sweat to the surface and
provided you're wearing clothes that allow some air to get out away
from the body, so you're not wearing, you know, really tight, you know
spandex type clothing or something like that, or, you know seal type
saran wrap type clothing that sweat will evaporate off into the dry
atmosphere. Whereas on a humid day, the reason you see people in New
York and Florida on a humid summer day and they're like moving their
shirts off themselves and you see people with, you know big sweat
stains and back sweat stains and all this kind of stuff is because
they're sweating as they normally would, but it's humid and so there
is the humidity, the air doesn't allow transfer of that sweat into the
atmosphere as readily and so you're hot, okay? So without the
evaporation, you're going to be warmer. So we evaporate off sweat, we
sweat and we vasodilate when we want to dump heat. When we want to
maintain heat, we vasoconstrict and we tend to not sweat. The other
thing that happens is you'll get goosebumps. So-called goose pimples
they're sometimes called. Those are a throwback to the time where we
had fur over most, not all of our body. All mammals in the cold have a
process whereby adrenaline is released at low levels typically into
the body, that adrenaline activates what are called sympathetic
fibers, they have nothing to do with sympathy, those little fibers,
which are neurons, those fibers that what I'm saying are fibers are
neurons, not clothing fibers, reach up into the skin so your whole
body is covered with these little tiny neurons that reach up into the
skin and when we are cold, they actually mechanically take the hair
follicle and bend it up, it's a process called pilo erection, P-I-L-O
erection, okay? So on a hot day, you want to dump heat, okay? So on a
hot day, what would happen is you'd actually not see those goose
pimples because you want the hairs lying down which actually you would
think that might insulate you more but we'll actually let more heat
dissipate out through the skin. On a cold day, you get these goose
pimples or goosebumps which are really just an ancient carry over from
the body's attempt to make hair stand up on end. And when hair step
stand up on end and they're very close together that traps air in
between them and actually creates a sort of insulated blanket of warm
air. If you've ever seen an animal like a a Malamute or a Husky, you
might think, oh that poor thing on a hot day, what does it do? You
know, with all that hair? Well, it can be warm so the animal will
typically pant and its hair will lay down, which you might think would
act as more of a blanket, but on a cold day what'll happen is they'll
become very puffy. Their hair will stand up on end and that's actually
trapping heat between the hairs and they're actually quite well
insulated. So it's very important that if you want to understand how
you can leverage temperature for physical performance, you have to
understand that you have vasoconstriction to conserve heat,
vasodilation to dump heat, that you are sweating to dump heat, and you
have conservation of fluids in order to preserve heat. That's the most
important thing in terms of understanding the mechanisms of
maintaining and dumping heat. And now the most important thing to
understand is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=1355"&gt;Heat Is What Limits Effort: Even If You Feel Fine/Motivated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you get too hot, not only do those enzymes stop working but your
ability to contract your muscles stops, okay? I'm going to repeat this
because it's vitally important. ATP is involved in the process of
generating muscle contractions, it doesn't matter if you're running a
marathon, doesn't matter if you're doing a yoga class, doesn't matter
if you're going for a 700 pound squat, the range of temperatures
within which ATP can function and muscles can contract is very narrow.
Somewhere around 39 or 40 degrees Celsius, it drops off and you will
not be able to generate more contractions. Now that's pretty hot, but
that temperature can be generated locally really fast. Now, if you're
too cold, it's true it's hard to generate muscle contractions. I got
into doing some cold water swimming a little while ago and we would
joke that, you know, you come out of the water, we do no wetsuits, I'm
not recommending people do this necessarily unless you're with
certainly with somebody else who's skilled at doing it, which I was.
And you come out and you feel like you have claws for hands. You can,
you know, you could never text on a phone for the first few minutes, I
mean, the water was very, very cold and you can't even move your face
and so muscles will become rigid but heating up muscles causes them to
fail to be able to generate more contractions. Put simply if you get
too hot, you stop exercising. You may not even realize it but your
will to exercise further, your ability to push harder is entirely
dependent on the heat of the muscle both locally and your whole
system. So let's talk about your whole system because I just described
heat dumping and heat maintaining. I told you that increasing heat
makes it hard for muscles to contract. It will stop you from being
able to run further and faster, it will stop you from being able to
lift more weights, more sets, more repetitions. If you can keep
temperature in range however, in a proper range, you will be able to
do more work, you will be able to create greater output, you'll be
able to lift more weight, more sets, more reps and you'll be able to
run further. Now, there are data that I'm going to talk about in a
little bit that are absolutely striking that underscore that
statement. There are data from my colleague Craig Heller's lab in the
department of biology at Stanford and there are data that are now
being implemented. They were first implemented in a grant funded by
DARPA but now in professional sports teams. Many, if not all the NFL
teams are now using this technology as well as military uses it and
not just for sports performance, but also firefighters, construction
workers, other professions where elevated heat becomes a barrier to
performance and you can leverage this to really improve your workouts.
And when I say really improve, it is striking. I'm going to give away
a little hint of this now and then I'm going to tell you a little bit
more of the data later after I tell you the protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=1529"&gt;Proper Cooling Can Double, Triple, Quadruple (Or More) Your Ability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper cooling of the body, which has to be done in a very specific
way, has allowed recreational athletes, college students and typical
adults as well as professional athletes to go from doing their usual
output. In this case what comes to mind best would be a particular
professional athletes that a member of the 49ers at the time was able
to do 40 dips on his first set, 30, 20, 20, basically to 10 sets of
dips unassisted with anything else. That's an impressive especially
since he's a really large guy, 40 dips is as a respectable, these are
strict, full, full range dips. And then by the 10th set, there's a
steep drop-off. Using proper cooling of particular body compartments,
he was able to triple that within less than a week and maintain that
performance even without the cooling approach. So it was actually a
conditioning effect, all right? I'll get back to this in a little bit
but there are other fantastic leaps of effort and leaps of performance
that were demonstrated including endurance running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=1602"&gt;Heat Induced Confusion &amp;amp; Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I continue any, I just want to underscore again that
overheating is terrible. There's a famous example of this. This was
about 10, 15 years ago when a number of dietary supplements that
included things like epinephrin which is a stimulant, it's a beta
adrenergic stimulant, drugs like Clenbuterol, which were then banned
from the Olympics, which are still out there have been in recreational
use which were beta adrenergic agonist so these are drugs that sort of
mimic epinephrin adrenaline to some extent, I know I'm oversimplifying
this here. They improve flat loss because of the effects on metabolism
but they heat up the body. And what happened was, this hit the press
very widely is high school football players and various professional
athletes were dropping dead because they were overheating during
practice or in competition. So much so that Clenbuterol was banned.
Although every once in a while, somebody gets in trouble for using
this, there was an incidence of this recently in professional boxing
which was attributed to a bad meat that had contained the Clenbuterol.
I don't know what the source was, I don't have any commentary about
that, but it still is in use, but these drugs increased body
temperature, increased fat loss, but carry is severe danger and that's
the danger of hyperthermia. In fact, I would argue and I think in
talking to some folks at in various professional fighting
organizations it's very clear that a lot of the deaths that one sees
in professional combat sports may have to do as much with dehydration
and overheating as it does with getting hit in the head, which is also
bad, but that things can compound that can have a synergistic effect.
And just a note about that and hyperthermia and it's dangerous as
well. My first project ever in science was to evaluate the thermogenic
effects of MDMA or ecstasy. That was my senior thesis in college
actually. And what we found was that indeed drugs that remove your
understanding of how warm you are cause you to not take on the
appropriate behaviors to cool yourself, right? So your
vasoconstriction and you're sweating, those are autonomic, those are
going to happen no matter what unless you happen to take something
that blocks that effect. However, there are a lot of things that we as
humans do to prevent ourselves from overheating and the main one is
stop. When we are running in the desert or when we're running very
hard and suddenly we stop, oftentimes that's because the muscles are
overheating, it's a subconscious thing. We won't often think, oh, I'm
really much too warm, it's just that we stop and it's a self-
preservation mechanisms. Sometimes it kicks into early, sometimes it
kicks into late. Kicks in too late, you can die. There's an instance
in the 1984 Olympics where there was the first year I believe that
there was a women's marathon, I think that's correct. And one of the
front runners or top picks for winning was heading into the stadium
and all of a sudden, it seemed as if she was lost, she was kind of
wandering around not knowing where she should go and in fact, she was
in a position to win or at least take second place, at least take
silver, got totally disoriented and did miserably in the race and she
was hyperthermic, she was running against that reflex to stop. So
dumping heat is key. So how do you dump heat in order to perform
longer safely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=1802"&gt;The Three Body Parts Best For Heating &amp;amp; Cooling Your Whole Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in order to understand that you have to understand that the body
has three main compartments for regulating temperature, okay? We don't
just have a center and a periphery, we have three main compartments
and there's one compartment in particular that all of you or most all
of you, I have to assume have and if you can understand how that
works, you can do tremendous things for your performance and for your
recovery. So what I'm about to tell you will allow you to perform
better in all forms of exercise and it is not commonly known,
unfortunately, I'm here to try and change that. You have three
compartments for increasing or dumping heat in your body. One is your
core, we already talked about that. Your core organs, your heart, your
lungs, your pancreas, your liver, this is the core of your body. The
other is your periphery, which are obviously your arms and your legs
and your feet and your hands. But then there's a third component which
has their three locations on your body that are far better at passing
heat out of the body and bringing cool into the body such that you can
heat up or cool your body everywhere very quickly. Those three areas
are your face, the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet.
Now, the skin on your hands and on the bottoms of your feet and to
some extent on your face are called glaborous skin. That's G-L-A-B-O-
R-O-U-S glaborous skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=1898"&gt;Face, Palms, Bottoms of Feet; Glabrous Skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what's special about those areas of your body and the glaborous
skin is that the arrangement of vasculature, of blood vessels,
capillaries and arteries that serve those regions is very different
than it is elsewhere in your body. Now, this has ancient roots.
Typically, if you were another mammal, like a bear or some sort of
ape, you would have hair all over your body. Now we all know some
pretty hairy people. I presume you've heard that there are these hairy
people, I know a few excessively hairy people and Castilla is
excessively hairy but he's not a person obviously but all mammals have
hair on their bodies, too. Some people have very light hair or very
fine hair. We don't have hair on these glaborous skin regions. Now, of
course you can have beard or facial hair growth but there are still
regions like the cheeks and other areas that maintain this special
vasculature. Okay, so technically the hands and feet are real
glaborous skin and the face is not always quite classified as
glaborous but these three locations face, palms of hands not tops and
bottoms of feet are very good at dumping heat and bringing in cool.
And the reason is there's a rule in vascular biology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=1980"&gt;Arterio-Venous Anastamoses (AVAs) Are Super Cool(ing)!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that blood moves from arteries to capillaries and then to veins, and
then back to the heart, okay? So arteries which are the big ones
obviously, capillaries which are the little fine ones where oxygen and
carbon dioxide are exchanged and veins which then bring blood back to
the heart and other tissues of course. In these three regions of your
hands, your face and the bottoms of your feet, we have what are called
AVAs. AVAs are a very special pattern of vasculature. AVAs are
described in the medical textbooks. You can find them in Grey's
anatomy not the television show but the actual Grey's anatomy textbook
which is a real thing that exists and in all medical textbooks, okay?
So let's talk about AVAs and what they are and why they allow these
three regions of the body to heat or cool ourselves more readily. So
what are AVAs? AVAs are arterio-venous anastomosis. So if you want to
look that up you can just look up AVAs veins, capillaries, arteries if
you like, but I'll spell it for you. A-R-T-E-R-I-O, arterio venous,
V-E-N-O-U-S, arterio-venous anastomosis, A-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.
Arterio-venous anastomosis, okay? You want to know about Arterio-
venous anastomosis, trust me and you want to remember that they are in
your hands, the bottoms of your feet and on your face, and in
particular on the palms of your hands, not the tops of your hands.
Now, before I said blood flows typically from arteries to capillaries,
to veins, and then back to the heart. But AVAs are direct connections
between the small arteries and the small veins. They bypass the
capillaries to some extent. They are little short vessel segments,
they have a big, large inner diameter and they have this very thick,
muscular wall. And they get input from what are called adrenergic
neurons. They get input from neurons that release norepinephrine and
epinephrine, which allows them to contract or dilate. Now there's some
rules of physics that talk about how the radius of a pipe and small
changes in the radius of a pipe leads to massive increases in the rate
and amount of stuff that can flow through that pipe, okay? There's a
rule of physics that says essentially that the radius is proportional
to the amount of stuff that can flow through something to the fourth
power. We're not going to make this a physics class, but if you want
to look that up, you can, you can just look up how does the radius of
a tube or pipe relate to how quickly or how much stuff can flow
through it? What you need to know, even if you don't want to know any
of the underlying physics is that these AVAs allow more heat to leave
the body more quickly and more cool to enter the body more quickly
than other venous arterial capillary beds throughout the body. In
other words, you can heat up best at the face, the palms and the
bottoms of the feet, and you can cool down best at the face, the palms
and the bottoms of the feet than you can anywhere else on your body.
And when I say heat up or cool down, I mean actually heat or cool the
core end your brain. Okay, so this is vitally important. I realize
we're getting down into the mechanistic weeds here, but you need to
know that these three compartments of your body, palms, bottoms of
feet and face are your best leverage points for manipulating
temperature to vastly improve physical performance, okay? I also want
to point out that the work that I'm going to tell you about is not
work from my laboratory. It's the work of, as I mentioned, my
colleague Craig Heller's laboratory at Stanford and we're going to
have Craig on as a guest to talk more about these discoveries, they
are his and his colleagues discoveries and how you can leverage them.
They're building out some amazing technology. I had a conversation
with Craig yesterday as a prelude to this episode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=2235"&gt;Palmar Cooling Can Supercharge Your Athletic Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and to the future conversation with him so you're getting the very
latest on this topic. So what Craig and his colleagues did really
illustrates perfectly what these body surfaces can do and why. They
were studying overheating in athletes and in military and in
construction workers and trying to prevent it. And they did a bunch of
experiments, I won't go into all of them now but what they essentially
found was that cooling the palms, palmer cooling allowed people,
athletes, and recreational athletes to run much further, to lift more
weight and to do more sets and reps to a absolutely staggering degree.
Let's talk for a second, a bit more about why we stop, why we shut off
effort when we get too hot because in doing so, you'll really
understand how and why the best protocols exist for being able to do
more work, to be able to exercise longer and actually to feel good
doing it. You actually can make a doubling of your dips or believe it
or not a tripling or quadrupling or more of your pull-ups fairly
straightforward. I mentioned before that when muscle heats up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=2315"&gt;ATP, Pyruvate Kinase &amp;amp; Heat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enzymes start getting disrupted and ATP and muscles can't work so well
and those muscles can't contract. Let's get a little more specific
about that. The enzyme that's involved here is something called
pyruvate kinase. You don't need to know about pyruvate kinase but what
you do need to know is that it ends A-S-E which means it's an enzyme
and pyruvate kinase is essentially a rate limiting step. It's a
critical step that you can't bypass if you want muscles to contract
and it's very temperature sensitive. Therefore, if you can keep
temperature lower, you can do more work per unit time, you can do more
pull-ups and that actually was done by Craig and his colleagues,
excuse me. The pull-ups weren't actually done by Craig, I don't know
how many pull-ups Craig can do, I'll ask him next time, both cooled
and uncooled, how many pullups he can do. But what they essentially
did is they brought someone into their laboratory who could do 10 pull
ups on the first set and they were able to get 10, rest two or three
minutes get another 10, rest or three minutes and if you've ever tried
this, what you find is that you start dropping to eight, seven, six,
et cetera. Now, the person might not necessarily feel like they're
overheating, but the muscle is heating up. Then with their knowledge
that these AVAs, that these that these portals in the palms are a
great way to both heat the body, but also to dump heat from the body,
they used the device and I'll talk about what you can do at home but a
device where they had people hold on to what was essentially a cold
tube. Now this is crucial, the tube can't be so cold that it causes
vasoconstriction because then the cold won't pass from the tube to the
hand and to the core. But if it's the right temperature, it's neither
too hot nor too cold, that cool from the cold tube passes into the
hand, these so-called palmer regions and then cools the core and in
theory by lowering body temperature would allow the person or the
athlete to do more work and indeed that's what they saw. The actual
data, the specific data showed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=2455"&gt;Palmer Cooling Outperforms Anabolic Steroids Several-Fold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that subjects could do, at least the subjects they worked with, on
their first day with no cooling about a hundred pull-ups across the
timeframe that they had, okay? So it might've taken anywhere from 10
to 15 or maybe more sets depending on how skilled that person was but
in a fixed amount of time. Then they came back and did the cooling.
They did it the very next day which if you've ever trained a muscle,
the very next day typically you wouldn't do as well in its training if
it took any damage from the previous session or you at least do as
well, but you probably wouldn't do what they then observed, which was,
they started after every other set, the person would just hold the
cold tube, cool down the body after every other set, rest everything
else was kept the same and they found that they went to 180 pull-ups,
which is incredible, it's a near doubling. And by doing this
repeatedly over several sessions, over several weeks, they quickly
went in the cooling group from a maximum of somewhere between 180 and
200 as I recall, I'm sort of estimating now, to 600 pull-ups in the
equivalent amount of time which is absolutely incredible. They then
repeated this in a study on the bench press and actually the bench
press study was pretty interesting because they actually had a control
group that was admittedly taking specific amounts of anabolic
steroids, the antibiotic steroid was testosterone cypionate which is
essentially testosterone, and indeed the testosterone cypionate, the
steroid group improved at a rate of about 1% per week. There were
differences and the cooling group basically left all other groups in
the dust, it was just remarkable. So cooling the core, I want to be
very clear that it's not cooling the muscle, wasn't about cooling the
chest alone or just cooling the palms, it was about allowing cold to
pass through the palms because of the unique vasculature that's there,
these AVAs allowed the subjects to do far more work per unit time. And
the important thing is that if they were to come back after doing 600
pull-ups or 500 pull-ups, you might say, well, wow that's going to
create a situation where recovery is going to be absolutely
impossible. They could come back, not use the cooling and they still
saw a highly significant increase in the amount or the number of pull-
ups or dips or bench press weight that they could do, okay? So what
that meant is that it was both an excellent performance and an
excellent training stimulus that they were able to recover from, okay?
I don't know if all of you are following this but these are the sorts
of increases in exercise output that are absolutely staggering and
that's why professional teams and the military and others capitalized
on them very quickly and use these. Okay, now you may be asking what
about endurance, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=2625"&gt;Increasing Endurance, Willpower &amp;amp; Persistence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone wants to be able to bench press a lot for multiple reps
and sets. And I should just mention for the bench pressing, it was, I
believe they were they found people that could bench press two 25, so
that's two 45 pound plates on the 45 pound standard Olympic bar for
repetitions of anywhere from six to 10 and then they had them do the
same thing. They did a set, they'd rest two or three minutes,
sometimes up to four minutes, then do another set, repeat, repeat,
repeat, and with cooling, they were able to increase the amount of
work, the number of reps with the same weight. Sometimes they did have
to increase sets to approximately double, so it was pretty fantastic.
So with endurance, similar increases have been shown and the way that
they do those tests are a little bit different and they also point to
a really important mechanism of why we stopped doing work at all when
we perceive that we are putting in too much effort. So it gets right
to the heart of the relationship between temperature in muscle and
your willpower, those are directly related. Your body heat and your
willpower are linked in a physiological way. So I'm not talking about
the kind of stuff that you see as kind of like clickbait on the
internet, or like increase willpower now or become resilient now, or
never do this again if you want to be mentally strong, I'm talking
about a physiological mechanism that exists in the body and brain that
causes you to stop or that will allow you to continue to go harder and
further than you normally would. Okay, so let's talk about willpower
and heat and how heat shuts you down. In other words, if you are cool,
if your body temperature is in a particular range, not only can you go
further, but you will go further if you want to. Said differently, if
you heat up too much, you will stop or you will die. Typically people
stop, there are individuals who will push to the point where they
black out and die, in the same way that, and please don't do this
experiment, there are people who can sit down face to face and say,
let's hold our breath and whoever breathes first loses. Some people
will just go until it's painful and then they'll gasp and take a big
breath. There are always those individuals who can override that
reflex and they will go until they pass out, okay? And if you do that
in water, you can very easily die, so please don't do that experiment.
But there's a reflex that relates the body to the brain and the brain
to the body that shuts off our effort when we get too hot. So what
Craig and his colleagues and now others have done is to do a test in
the laboratory where rather than ask people to run outside until they
absolutely don't want to run anymore, you put them on a treadmill and
you set the speed, okay? So they have to keep up with the treadmill
and at some point they quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=2793"&gt;Cardiac Drift, &amp;amp; Moving the ”I Quit” Point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you take groups and you do those in different temperature
environments. So some people are running in a nice chilly laboratory,
they get their heart rate up. So maybe their heart rate goes from, you
know, 40 or 50 baseline heart rate, maybe it gets up to 80 or a
hundred and then they keep the rate of the treadmill going the same
and they'll just plateau. So they're getting into a steady state
cadence or rhythm and their heart is beating it more or less a steady
state. Eventually they'll probably stop 'cause they have something
else to do but people will continue at that temperature and at that
heart rate, unless you start turning up the temperature in the room
and at some point they will stop and they'll stop much earlier when it
gets hot because of something called cardiac drift, okay? So let's say
I'm running and I'm running at a steady cadence on this treadmill and
my heart rate is 85 beats per minute or a hundred beats per minute,
doesn't matter, let's say a hundred just for sake of example. Well,
just making the room hotter is going to increase my heart rate
further, even though I'm at the same output and the brain does a
computation, it somehow figures out that there's a heat component
that's increasing heart rate and there's an effort component from
running that's driving heart rate. And if the heat component and the
heart rate output from the effort, get to hit a certain threshold, I
stop. Okay, ad some of you may think, well there are people who just
run and run and run and never stop, eventually everyone stops. Maybe
it's because of the race ended, maybe it's because, you know, everyone
else quit. I actually saw some stuff online, there are these races
where people just will continuously do the same loop until everyone
else drops out and then one guy or girl keeps going past everybody.
But typically it stops because the race is over or because people
quit. Increasing temperature increases the rate of quitting in part,
not entirely, but in part because of this thing called cardiac drift
which you've probably experienced if you've been out on a hot day and
you're walking uphill you might stop to take a breath. If you sit in a
sauna, your heart rate will increase. Heat increases heart rate,
effort increases heart rate. At a steady effort, you'll have a steady
heart rate. If you increase the heat in the environment that you're
engaging in that steady heart rate, your heart rate will now go up due
to cardiac drift and you will quit, okay? So Heller and colleagues
have done experiments where they do palmer cooling under these
environments. And that's wonderful because not only does it enable
people to go further and faster for much longer that's been shown
statistically significant every time but it also protects the brain
and body against hyperthermia, overheating, coma, nerve injury, nerve
death, and actual death, okay? So you can see why this is such a
valuable tool. So what are they doing? Well, in this case too they're
having them cool their hands and they're cooling the palms. Cooling
the bottoms of the feet is a little trickier but cooling the face
could actually work as well. And we're going to talk about cooling the
face and how to incorporate this. So at this point, I've just really
wanted to impress upon you not impress you, but impress upon you the
fact that you have these three surfaces of your body that are very
good at passing cold into the body, such that it cools the core body
temperature and that's a good thing for health and safety and in order
to maintain work output over longer periods of time, or actually just
do more work. I mean to me the result is just so staggering is the
hundred to 180 pull-ups in the controls and then 600 pull-ups in the
cooled individuals, right? They actually also feel mentally as if they
can do more work. It's not just that they can, their willpower is
adjusted somehow by these shifts in temperature. Now, before we
continue and get to the exact ways that any number of us can start to
use this information, I want to talk about the opposite thing, which
is heating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=3044"&gt;Deliberate Heating: Myths and Better Protocols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you have to remember that these surfaces, the palms and the
bottoms of the feet and the face will not just a range with these
AVAs, these special ways to pass blood from arteries to veins in order
to cool us for better athletic performance or to heat us for on cold
days but for both of those things. Now Heller and colleagues and
others have also explored how these can be used to heat up the core.
There are times when we want to heat up our core. Typically we hear
that most of the heat escapes through our heads, so we'll put on a hat
when we go outside, that's actually not true. Most of your heat
escapes through your face, the palms of your hands and the bottoms of
your feet. Now you should know why that's the case. What this means is
that for post-surgery patients or for people that are hypothermic,
indeed you want to heat the core, right? But actually I was on a swim
recently where a friend became hypothermic. He was kind of slurring
his words and kind of staggering around when we got him back on the
beach, we brought him over to the lifeguard station, he turned out to
be fine. Again, this is why cold water swims are something that you
really need to do in groups, not alone and you really have to know
what you're doing. There were reasons for why this happened that day,
but, you know we were basically people thought we were a little
strange until they realized what was happening. We were walking down
the beach basically sandwiching him between at our chest because we
were still warmer than the ambient environment, the environment around
us. And we were pushing our chest against him to try and warm him up
to warm up his core. In retrospect, that was the wrong thing to do. In
talking with Craig and talking to other colleagues that work on
thermogenesis. What we should have done was warm, hit the palms of his
hands, the bottoms of his feet and his face because that would
insulate the heat loss. Now he was very cold so presumably there was
vasoconstriction of the veins at these locations. And so it's not
clear that that would have been the only strategy to use but they have
explored how to heat up post-surgery patients and one of the best ways
to do that is to get warm socks on the bottoms of the feet, get gloves
on the hands and if it can be done safely to warm the face. Now, of
course you don't want to obstruct respiration and things of that sort.
But again the ability to pass heat into the body or to remove heat to
the body is best done through these three surfaces. I can't emphasize
that enough. So I mentioned before that you want to cool the palms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=3200"&gt;Protocols For Self-Directed Cooling To Vastly Improve Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or the bottoms of the feet although that's a little harder to do or
the face but not so much that the blood vessels constrict because then
you won't be able to pass cool into the body because those pipes got
smaller and therefore you can't pass cool into the body. So how can
you start to incorporate this? Well, Craig and colleagues have a
company that they've spun out through Stanford. We'll talk about that
when we sit down with Craig that has made engineered devices that are
optimal for this that are going to keep those passages open, keep the
size of the, those veins correct to pass cool into the body quickly
for sake of elite sports performance and even recreational sports
performance but you can actually start to incorporate this. First of
all, I always get asked how cold should the water be? Should it be ice
water? Should it be very cold water? The answer is no. If you want to
experience some of this effect without a device, one thing you could
do would be for instance to do, I dunno, I'll use the, the, the gym or
the treadmill as an example. You could do your maximum number of pull-
ups, stop and then you could actually put your hands into or on the
surface of a sink that is presumably stopped up with cool water. So
not ice water, not freezing cold, but cool water, slightly cooler than
body temperature before you started training would be a good place to
start. You do that for 10 to 30 seconds. Then you could go back and do
your next set. You would repeat the cooling, you would want to extend
the amount of cooling somewhat so you might want to do that for 30
seconds to a minute. This is not going to be perfect, you're going to
have to play with how cold to make it in order to get the optimal
effect but you ought to see an effect nonetheless. The same is true if
you're running and you're fatiguing, obviously you don't want to
become hyperthermic, cooling the hands or the bottoms of your feet or
the face would be the ideal way to dump heat in order to be able to
generate more output. Now, the face is something that we haven't
talked a lot about. Everything I've told you up until now also says
that if you are somebody who tends to get cold when you are outside,
say in the winter or even in the fall, you tend to run cold, warming
your face is going to be the most important thing that you can do.
Now, it's kind of hard to do that without looking strange like wearing
a ski mask or something like that but that is going to be more
effective than covering and warming any other part of your body
although it'd be quite strange if you only had a ski mask on and you
weren't wearing clothes anywhere else on your body, I don't recommend
doing that outside, that will get you into all sorts of other kinds of
trouble. That wouldn't be good for anybody. But now you understand the
principle and the locations at which to deliver heat and cold. So
let's say that you are out for a run and you want to incorporate this
cooling mechanism, I talked to Craig about this, I said, what would be
the kind of poor person's approach to this before this devices
commercially available? And he said, well, you, you could take a
frozen juice can, if you have one of those or a very cold can of soda
and you would want to pass it back and forth between your two hands.
The reason the passing back and forth is really important is because
you, again you don't want it to be so cold that you constrict those
veins portals that it will allow cold to go into the body. Now, there
are certainly people that are working on bike handles, and that can
actually cool the hands. You can expect with the Olympics coming up,
people are aware of these data and are starting to incorporate it into
a number of things. Here's what you don't want to do and there are
sports teams that I won't mention by name or brand that have made this
mistake and it costs them dearly. You don't want to cool the core if
you want to cool the body, right? If it's very hot day and you're
going to train, getting into an ice bath first, sure it will cool you
down, but it's not going to be as effective as cooling the palms, the
bottoms of the feet and the face. I have a friend who does some
important work in this space with people in various, let's just say
cultures where heat is generated quite a lot and they need to dump
heat, ice packs delivered to the face are something that they actually
use in order to dump heat quickly. Now, again, you don't want to keep
the ice pack on your face. These are people that are very high work
output, right? Firefighters and similar, at very high work output and
then they'll put this essentially, it's like a cool face mask on their
face. It allow their core body temperature come down and then they
remove it, they're not keeping it on there so long that they're
getting the vasoconstriction, okay? So there are a number of ways that
you could do this. And again, I'm not giving specific temperatures
because it depends on how hot that day and how hot your body
temperature is. So you can see why there's a need to create more
devices for this, but you can see a considerable improvement in
endurance, in strength and in all kinds of explosive and sort of, you
know, explosive power type output in athletics by using these surfaces
of the hands and bottoms of the feet and face. The one that I've tried
because in anticipation of this episode was the dips where then I
would cool my hands, I actually decided to cool the bottoms of my feet
as well, because it just feels good and it's particularly hot out
lately, so no shoes or socks on, put my feet into the bottoms of my
feet just kind of hovering about a centimeter or two below the surface
of a bucket of water that was just slightly, it felt cool, slightly
cooler than body temperature or so. It just basically what came out of
the spigot after I let it run for a little bit. And indeed I saw a 60%
increase in the number of dips I can do in a single session. So it's
actually a quite significant effect and you don't have to be perfectly
precise in order to do it. And of course, if you want to heat up for
whatever reason, like you're camping or you're lost in the
environment, remember these three surfaces are going to be the best
way to heat your as well. So up until now, we've been talking about
how to use cold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=3563"&gt;How To Use Cold To Recover Faster &amp;amp; More Thoroughly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;during a workout in order to improve performance and indeed cold
applied to the appropriate parts of the body, the appropriate times
can vastly improve our performance and endurance and strength. Now, I
want to talk about the use of temperature in particular cold to
improve the speed and the depth of recovery. Recovery is obviously
vital, right? During a weight training session or during an endurance
session, that's just the stimulus for getting better the next time and
if you don't recover, you not only won't get better, but you'll get
worse. There's a lot of interest in the use of cold in order to
improve recovery in the short term. We see this and probably the best
example of this would be fighters in combat sports between rounds or
athletes during in between quarters or halftime, that's one form of
recovery. The ability to go back into the sport very soon on an order
of minutes, anywhere from like one minute in between rounds and
typical combat sports or several minutes and a half time, et cetera.
Typically what we see is people cooling their core, cooling the back
of their neck, cooling the top of their heads. So it might be, you
know, a sponge with cold water over the top of the head or an ice pack
on the back of the neck, or in some cases even wearing cold ice vests,
that's actually been done. That's going to be a very inefficient way
to improve recovery of that kind. Far better would be to cool the
face, the palms of the hands or the bottoms the feet for the reasons
that I described up until now. Submerging the body in an ice bath, or
taking a cold shower, say up to the neck or up to the chest or getting
under cold water or jumping in a cold lake or something of that sort,
or in the locker room, getting under the cold shower also would be a
terrible way to cool off the body quickly compared to the ways that I
described through the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet or
the face for the following reason. First of all, it's not optimizing
those portals of the face, palms the hands and the feet and in
addition, if it's very cold and you submerge or you cover a lot of the
body with that cold, you're going to cause constriction of the very
vessels and pathways that allow the body to efficiently dump heat. So
again, the key thing is to cool these one or two or three of these
surfaces but not so cold that you cause the vasoconstriction. So what
does this mean for you? It means that getting in an ice bath or a cold
shower or putting an ice pack on the back of your neck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=3725"&gt;Ice Baths &amp;amp; Cold Showers Can Prevent Training Progress: mTOR, etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in most cases is not going to be as good as splashing cold water on
your face or even just holding your face in a damp cool cloth or
something of that sort. It seems kind of counterintuitive, you think,
oh if I just jump into an ice bath, I'm going to cool down much faster
than if I just cooled these, you know one or two or three of these
select regions of the body but that's actually not the case. And then
of course there's recovery that occurs from session to session. So
outside of the game or the match or the exercise session and many
people are now relying on things like cryotherapy which requires a lot
of expensive equipment, big, you know liquid nitrogen driven machine.
Those aren't so common for most people or accessible for most people,
but a lot of people are using cold baths or ice baths or cold showers.
And again, that's not going to optimize recovery. In fact, it's going
to have an additional effect that is going to potentially block the
training stimulus. When you get into an ice bath indeed, there are,
provided it's not very, very cold, if you get into a cold shower,
provided is not very, very cold, you are indeed blocking some of the
inflammation that occurs because of the training session. But in doing
so you also are blocking pathways, such as mTOR, mammalian target of
rapamycin, which are involved in the adaptation for a muscle to become
stronger or bigger. Put simply, covering the body in cold or immersing
the body in cold after training can short circuit or prevent the
hypertrophy or muscle growth response. It has other effects that can
be positive, right? It can induce thermogenesis, et cetera, it can
reduce inflammation but it can prevent some of the positive effects of
exercise. Now, it hasn't been examined so much for endurance work but
let's say you come back from around of endurance work or run or a bike
or a swim, getting into a cool bath or cooling the palms, the bottoms
of the feet or the face, in my opinion, based on the science would be
better than completely immersing the body in the ice bath or the cold
shower. There is a time and a place for the use of the ice bath or the
cold shower or the cold plunge, those tend to be when you want to
deliberately increase brown fat thermogenesis or when you want to
deliberately work on mental resilience. And in a subsequent episode on
fat loss I'm going to talk about how to optimize the use of cold
specifically for increasing metabolism and fat loss. But for now,
since we're talking about the use of cold for improving performance
and recovery, the suggestion that I'm going to provide is based on the
work of Craig Heller and colleagues that I've been talking about as
well as a excellent book I mainly rely on textbooks and special volume
books which are collections of papers from experts in a particular
area that go beyond standard kind of college level textbooks. The one
that I've been relying on is called "Thermoregulation in Human
Performance, Physiological and Biological Aspects" by Effie Marino. I
don't know the publisher, I don't know the author. I do recognize some
of the names of the particular papers there, but I just want to be
clear there's no sort of business relationship or deal with them but
it's an excellent text, it's called "Thermoregulation in Human
Performance". You can find it online if you want to go really deep
into this but basically what they show is that if you can cool the
body back to its resting temperature, for and by resting temperature,
I mean within the range that you would see at any time of waking day,
but not in exercise. So just bringing that the body temperature down
to baseline. If you can do that, the sooner you can do that after a
workout, the sooner that the muscle will recover, that the tendons
will recover and that the person you can get back into more endurance
training, more weight training, et cetera. So cold actually can be a
very powerful tool for recovery but to maximize return to baseline
levels of temperature, it's my belief based on the studies that are
published in this book as well as my discussions with my colleague,
Craig Heller and in reviewing the literature overall that just simply
cooling the entire body by jumping into an ice bath or a cold shower
is not the best way to go. You really want to rely on one of these
three glaborous skin portals of the palms, the bottoms of the feet or
the face. So now you probably know more than you ever wanted to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=3989"&gt;Alcohol, Caffeine, NSAIDs: Their Temperature Effects Matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about how we regulate body temperature and how it can be applied to
exercise both during the exercise session and afterward to optimize
recovery. Many of us, all of us, presumably are also eating and
drinking things and taking things at various times that can impact
this process. And so, because of that, we should ask whether or not
those things are impacting body temperature. And when we do that, we
find that there are certain things that many of us are doing that are
actually impairing our performance. So for instance, if you are taking
a pre-workout drink or you're ingesting a lot of caffeine or other
substance to bring your body temperature up before exercise, you are
limiting the amount of exercise that you can do. I can recall a time
in college when I would drink a lot of espresso back then ephedrine
was sold over the counter, I remember taking it, it will really
energize you for workouts. You can generate a lot of energy and get
extremely focused taking those things. They do increase heart rate,
they can be quite dangerous, I don't recommend people take them. In
fact, I think ephedrine is now off the shelves as a non prescription
compound because various people died from taking it who were sensitive
to it or exercised in heat. But looking back at that, I realized it
was a foolish approach. It was increasing core thermogenesis. Sure I
might've burned a few more calories but actually when I look at the
data that are coming from specific cooling and how that can so
increase in performance if done properly and then I compare that to
the effects of taking some sort of thermogenic compound, whatever it
is some pre-workout or some pill or high levels of caffeine, it's very
clear that increasing body temperature prior to working out is the
exact wrong thing that one would want to do. You don't want to stay so
cold that you can't generate good muscle contractions. You don't want
to be like I am coming out of the cold ocean, you know, with claws for
hands but one wants to have your body temperature in a range that
still allows you to work hard and perform well. Now, in terms of
recovery, things like alcohol, we know our vasodilator. So those are
going to cause people to drop body temperature. So you might think,
oh, well that sounds great for recovery and I don't think people
should be drinking who are you know, have problems with alcohol
intake, you know, alcoholics or they're not of drinking age, et
cetera. I'm not a drinker, but I do have a good friend who's a quite
accomplished athlete who basically drinks a beer or two after his long
runs or cycling and you know, his argument is well, I'm dumping body
heat and I like a beer and he's probably right, it's probably a really
good tool provided you don't have issues with alcohol that would
preclude that as a tool or you're not of drinking age. But anything
that you ingest after exercise that would increase body temperature is
going to impede recovery. Anything that you do that lowers body
temperature provides it's in safe ranges is going to accelerate
recovery. And that brings us to the whole host of compounds that
people take that can increase body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=4184"&gt;Are Stimulants Counter Productive For Performance? It Depends.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many people are taking these things in order to increase fat
burning and increase metabolism but in my opinion it's impeding their
ability to perform well. And especially if the performance is
something that you're focused on aside from body recomposition, losing
fat building muscle. But even if you're focused on losing fat,
building muscle you have to ask yourself, is the body temperature
increase that I'm getting from these compounds really worth it given
that it can block or prevent my performance from being as good as it
could? In other words, is it worth taking something that makes you
feel very energized to go work out but then you now know that you are
stopping earlier and you're performing less well, fewer reps, fewer
steps overall, is it worth it? If you had not taken that thing then
you could perform much longer and at much higher capacity. Some of you
are probably saying, well, that's ridiculous because when I drink a
quadruple espresso and I pop a whatever pre-workout or drink a pre-
workout then I know I can go much further. Ah, that might be true but
the increase in temperature is also costing you on the recovery side.
And unless you're doing other things to improve your recovery and I
know many people that are, I don't judge but many people who are doing
those things are also augmenting their recovery through hormone
augmentation and other performance enhancing tools, then for the
typical person who's not doing that it's probably shooting yourself in
the foot. So let's take a look at what some of those compounds are and
what they and just briefly review whether or not they would be a good
or a bad idea to include if your main goals are performance or your
main goals are body recomposition or both. So let's just briefly
discuss stimulants. This could be caffeine, this could be any other
kind of stimulant that are typically in a pre-workout drink or
anything that might get you revved up before exercising. This could
even be very strong tea, I've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate. I
like a yerba mate, I love that stuff and I also drink caffeine. I
drink love coffee of various kinds mushroom coffee, black coffee,
espresso, et cetera. I'm a chronic caffeine user, I don't think I'm an
addict but I'm a chronic caffeine user. Meaning when I drink caffeine
my heart rate doesn't increase so much that it feels like a shock to
my system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=4320"&gt;The Caffeine Rule &amp;amp; “Caffeine Adaptation”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are not caffeine adapted or they're very caffeine
sensitive. Here's the straightforward rule. Caffeine for somebody who
doesn't drink caffeine very much will constrict the blood vessels and
will increase retention of body heat and it's probably a bad idea
before exercise. For somebody who's caffeine adapted and is used to
drinking caffeine, it won't have that vasoconstriction effect, that's
what the data point too, because I'm adapted to it but it will cause
vasodilation and will allow me to dump body heat. So for me, I use it
before I train or do any kind of exercise because I tend to do that
early in the day, it won't prevent me from sleeping and it causes
vasodilation. And then afterwards I'm aware that it causes
vasoconstriction after the caffeine wears off. So for somebody who
drinks two or three or more cups of coffee a day or mate a day, so
we're talking intake of anywhere from a hundred to 400 milligrams of
caffeine, what you want to do is you want to make sure that you would
do that before exercise and probably not after exercise, not just
makes logical sense given what we know about thermal regulation. And
if you're somebody who doesn't drink caffeine, drinking caffeine
before a workout is going to be about the worst thing that you could
possibly do because it's going to increase core body temperature
through its thermogenic effects and it's going to constrict your blood
vessels and make it even harder to dump heat. So I don't suggest that
people drink caffeine or not, I just suggest that you think about
whether or not your caffeine adapted or not, and decide whether or not
you want to drink caffeine. In general, you're going to be better not
drinking any caffeine than you are drinking caffeine unless you're a
heavy caffeine user or abuser. In which case not drinking caffeine is
going to give you vicious headaches and is going to make it very hard
to get motivated because you're just not used to it. It takes about
three weeks to get used to no caffeine. It's brutal, I've done it
before, I've done caffeine fast, I don't know that I ever want to do
it again, that's how painful it was. But you get headaches because of
the effects on vasodilation and constriction. If you like caffeine use
in moderate amounts and use it before your not after. If you don't
like caffeine or you don't use it very often, stay away from it
anywhere close to exercise before or after for that matter. One of the
more commonly used compounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=4460"&gt;NSAIDs for Training: Performance Enhancements &amp;amp; Risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that's sold over the counter are non-steroid anti-inflammatories so
things like Tylenol and Advil and other trade names and Neproxin
sodium things of that sort, almost all of those drop body temperature
to some extent. And that's why it's often recommended that people take
them when they have a fever although the whole business of dropping
body temperature artificially when you have a fever is itself an
interesting discussion whether or not that's the most adaptive or best
thing to do certainly you don't want fever to go too high, can be very
dangerous, can kill you but artificially dropping body temperature
with these compounds can be tricky. Now, a number of athletes
especially endurance athletes will rely on these non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs specifically to keep body temperature lower during
long bouts of exertion. This is a little bit of a pharmacologic
version of dumping heat instead of using palmer cooling or you know,
face ice pack cooling, they're relying on pharmacology to drop their
core body temperature. That has certain obvious advantages, those
advantages should be obvious and the reasons for them should be
obvious based on everything we've talked about up until now lower
temperature allows you to go further harder with more intensity.
However, they do have effects on the liver and they can also have
effects on the kidneys and during long bouts of exercise or even short
bouts of exercise, water balance and salt balance are also going to be
vital to maintain in order to perform well, generate the best muscle
contraction, stay mentally alert and also to stay alive. We will do an
episode on salt electrolytes and water and water balance but you
probably want to think carefully about whether or not you want to use
non-steroid anti-inflammatories before any training session just for
the performance augmentation effect unless you're working carefully
with a coach whether or not you've done that in practices and of
course, whether or not you are in a situation where monitoring your
body temperature carefully is going to be important. You might ask,
well, when would that be? Well, desert races, summer training and
races, winter rides, you certainly don't want to get too cool either.
So alcohol, caffeine and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs because
of their effects on temperature will impact performance and recovery
but you want to be cautious about how you approach them. I personally
am more a fan of using caffeine in moderate doses for the reasons I
described before as well to use the cooling of the palms, cooling of
the bottoms of my feet, right, by placing them into a bucket or into a
cool bath after training or cooling the face after training or
sometimes even during training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=4620"&gt;The Best Way to Explore Your Own “Parameter Space”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just seems like there's more of a margin to play with the
variables, to heat up the water or cool it down a little bit to
include one palm or the other palm. There's all sorts of good
parameter space as we call it in science that you can play with and
work with to find what works for you whereas when you pop a pill, sure
you can adjust the dose and you can adjust it next time but once it's
in you, it's in you and there's going to be some period of time before
you can modulate it. What I've offered today are ways in which you can
use temperature to powerfully improve performance. And if you think
about it, you can vary that from set to set, you could do your pull
ups or your sprints and then cool your palms, and then try and go with
colder water the next round or warmer water the next round or do both
feet and palms and face. I mean, you can do all sorts of things moment
to moment and see what works for you again essentially zero cost or no
cost. Whereas when you pop something, you take a pill, you're
basically in that regimen for the next hour or two or more. You can
always take more, but you can't really take less. You can't really
extract it from your body in real time so it doesn't give you a lot of
opportunity to play scientists, which is what I like to do because
what I'm always trying to do is trying to dial in the best protocols
possible based on the mechanisms and data. And if you can do that
moment to moment that places you in a position of power. Once again,
we covered a lot of material. By now, after seeing this episode or
listening to this episode, you should understand a lot about how your
body heats and cools itself and the value of that for physical
performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&amp;amp;t=4715"&gt;Tools: How To Try&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you'll also appreciate that you have tools at your disposal to
vastly improve your physical performance. And should you try those,
please let us know how it goes. If you decide to do palmer cooling
during your runs or after your runs, during your weight workouts,
during your yoga sessions, whatever it is, let us know, please place
that in the comments. I've given you specific protocols and some
direction, but I've also left it slightly vague because it, as I
mentioned earlier I don't know all the environmental conditions, I
don't know how hot your yoga studio is or how cool your gym happens to
be or your body temperature or time of day. Remember your temperature
will vary according to the time of day, we did a whole episode about
that related to sleep. Typically your body temperature is rising early
in the day and is coming down as you approach the late evening and
late night hours for sleep, in the middle of the night your
temperature is very low at its absolute lowest something we call the
temperature minimum. So we don't know exactly where you're at. You
need to take the information that you receive today and should you try
and incorporate it try and do it intelligently. Don't cool yourself
off so much that you know become cryogenic and please don't warm
yourself up. In fact, we didn't talk at all about warming yourself up
because warming yourself up too much can be quite dangerous. You
never, ever, ever want to be hypothermic, that's what your body and
your brain are trying to avoid. We talked a little bit about
supplements but not the standard sorts of supplements I usually list
off on these episodes. Rather, we talked about caffeine, non-steroid
anti-inflammatories and how those can impact temperature, how alcohol
can impact temperature. And I should just mention in closing that
every time we eat, we also increased temperature. There's a eating
induced thermogenic effect but that's a minor one, that's a small one.
So you wouldn't worry about eating before training because of its
effects on temperature because it tends to be really minor. Going
forward, we're going to talk more about temperature and other ways to
improve physical performance and skill learning. We're going to talk
about specific ways to accelerate fat loss, to improve muscle growth,
to improve suppleness and flexibility. These approaches and mechanisms
are anchored deeply in neuroscience and physiology and the
relationship between our peripheral organs, which include our skin and
our brain and all the organs in between. So it's really a pleasure for
me because I'm able to look to the textbook literature that exists and
really came out over the last 50 to a hundred years and unlike a lot
of areas of neuroscience which are still sort of mystical, like
consciousness and dreaming, of which we understand a little bit about
these core mechanisms of temperature and physiology which are so
powerful, involve very concrete studies that as you learn today are
very actionable. If you're enjoying this podcast and you like the

on supplements, but in other episodes I have, and there are certainly
supplements that are beneficial for sleep, for performance, for
learning, immunity and so forth. We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-
N-E.com, because Thorne supplements we believe to be the most
stringent in terms of what they put on the bottle is actually what's
in the bottle, so the amounts are precise and the quality of the
ingredients is very precise. They partner with the Mayo Clinic, all
the major sports teams so we're delighted that we're partnered with
Thorne. If you want to see the supplements that I take you can go to
thorne.com/u/huberman and you can see the supplements that I take, you

&lt;p&gt;[Andrew Huberman] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss
science and science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm
Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my
teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my
desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about
science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping
with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our
first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized
nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help
you better understand your body and reach your health goals. I've long
been a fan of doing blood tests and more recently as they've been
developed also DNA tests. And the reason for that is that so many of
the factors that impact our immediate and longterm health and that
inform our health choices can only be analyzed by way of blood or DNA
tests. The great thing about InsideTracker is they make getting the
blood and DNA test extremely easy. They'll come to your home if you
like, or you can go to a place where you can get your blood drawn and
your DNA swab taken there. As well once you get the information back
from InsideTracker, it's very easy to understand what to do with that
information, how to interpret it. And that's really what sets
InsideTracker apart I believe from other blood and DNA testing tools
and companies. Most sources and companies will give you information
back about what your levels of hormones are, and metabolic factors, et
cetera, but no clear directives about what to do with that information
to get those markers in the ranges that you want in order to optimize
your health. InsideTracker makes that all very easy. It gives you
directives about exercise, about nutrition, about various supplements
you may or may not want to take. And once again, only through blood
and DNA tests can you access that information? If you want to try
InsideTracker you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman And if you do
that you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker plans. That's
insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off and enter Huberman at
checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've
been taking Athletic Greens since 2012. And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast. I started taking Athletic Greens and I
still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day because it covers all
my nutritional, vitamin, mineral and probiotic basis. Of course, you
can get vitamins, and minerals, and probiotics from food, but many of
us including me find it hard to do that on a consistent basis.
Especially when I'm working a lot, when stress and sleep aren't
optimized, et cetera. With Athletic Greens I make sure to get all the
things I need and then all the other supplements I take or what I eat
I can consider additional insurance. The great thing about Athletic
Greens is it tastes great. I like to mix mine with water and a little
bit of lemon juice. I take it once early in the day and then sometimes
again in the afternoon. The fact that it includes probiotics is really
important to me. There are so many data now pointing to the fact that
probiotics and gut brain health, and gut health generally are very
important for metabolism, for hormone output, for neurotransmitter
production, so many vital things related to our health, Athletic
Greens makes it easy to make sure that I'm getting everything that I
need in the vitamin mineral and probiotic department. If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and
claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, plus a
year supply of vitamin D three K two. There's now a ton of data as
well, pointing to the fact that vitamin D three and K2 are important
for a huge number of health related factors, including hormones,
metabolic factors, neuro-transmitters et cetera. So they have the year
supply of vitamin D three completely free along with your Athletic
Greens offer, and you get the five free travel packs. So if you'd like
to try that you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and claim this
special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I started
meditating many years ago, but I found it was difficult to stay
consistent with my meditation practice. In fact when I would get
stressed or really busy that's when I probably needed the meditation
practice the most. And that's when I tended to drop the meditation
practice and run around doing other things. So it was really a kind of
catch 22. I learned about Headspace a few years ago on Jet Blue
Flights when they had them included as an option of whether or not to
watch a movie, or a television show, or do meditation. I tried the
meditation and I really liked it. Very easy to follow along with a
Headspace meditation. The meditations that they include on the
Headspace app, are also backed by dozens of peer reviewed quality
independent studies. And of course there are now thousands of peer
reviewed quality studies pointing to the fact that a meditation
practice is beneficial for sake of improved sleep, for reducing
stress, and a number of other health metrics, cardiovascular disease,
risk, et cetera. The great thing about Headspace is it's allowed me to
stay really consistent with my meditation practice. They have
meditations of different duration and different type, so you never get
bored. I actually look forward to my meditation practice and it
continues to benefit me. In fact, since starting Headspace, I've been
consistent with meditation for much longer than I ever had previously.
If you want to try Headspace you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer
and you'll get a free one month trial with Headspace's full library of
meditations for every situation. That's headspace.com/specialoffer to
get one month free trial, that's their best offer out there right now.
And then you can try their full library of meditations for every
situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=341"&gt;Energy &amp;amp; Your Immune System, &amp;amp; Learning Faster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we're going to continue our discussion about hormones and we're
going to focus on how particular hormones influence our energy levels
and our immune system. Now, last episode I mentioned at the end that
we were concluding our month on hormones, but we decide to include
this additional episodes, so this would be the fifth episode in the
sequence of episodes about hormones. Because there are two hormones
which are vitally important for a huge number of biological functions
that we will talk about today, but that are particularly important for
energy levels and your immune system. This is something that I get
asked about a lot. So rather than skip to the next general topic,
today we're going to talk about the hormones cortisol and epinephrine
also called adrenaline. You do not have to have heard the previous
episodes on hormones in order to understand and digest the material
from today's podcast. If I mentioned anything related to previous
episodes, I promise to give a little bit of quick background to get
everyone up to speed. Today, we're going to talk about the biology of
cortisol. We're going to talk about the biology of epinephrine. As
always we'll talk mechanism and there are going to be a lot of tools.
If you're somebody who struggles with stress and energy levels, and
balancing stress and energy levels, today's episode is going to be
vital for you. If you're somebody who has challenges with sleep or
you're somebody who has challenges getting your energy level up
throughout the day, and getting your energy level down when you want
to sleep today's episode is also for you. And we're going to talk
about the immune system and how to enhance the function of your immune
system. We're also going to get into some fun topics related to
learning and memory and how you can leverage cortisol and epinephrine
in particular, in order to learn faster. we're going to talk about so-
called nootropics, smart drugs and how they work, because there's
several of them that tap into the epinephrine system that aren't often
discussed and that you have access to. We're going to talk about how
caffeine can actually rewire your brain for better or for worse. And
we're going to talk about the biology of comfort foods and why they
work so well, and what they're doing. And in understanding that you'll
be able to better understand your food choices as they relate to
short-term and long-term energy. So we have a lot to cover, everything
will be timestamped. I want to just remind people that we caption
every episode in English and in Spanish. The captions take a day or
two to pop up on YouTube. So if you're not seeing those within the
first couple of days, please be patient with us, in order to get
captions that actually read similarly to what I'm saying. we go
through a captioning service, and so we have them done by experts and
that takes a little bit of additional time. Meanwhile if you have any
questions as the episode evolves please write them down. Please put
them in the comment section. Please subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already, and let's get started talking about how to increase
your energy, and improve and increase your immunity by leveraging the
biology of cortisol and adrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=514"&gt;Why &amp;amp; How Intermittent Fasting Increases Growth Hormone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the biology of increasing energy and your immune
system, I want to cover three topics that I promised I would mention
from previous episodes. The first one relates to intermittent fasting.
The second one relates to why your stomach grumbles. I forgot to
mention the biology of that last time. And the third is a powerful way
to increase growth hormone, which is powerful for increasing
metabolism, fat burning, and tissue repair, et cetera. That doesn't
involve a sauna or wrapping yourself in plastic bags and going for a
jog. So first intermittent fasting. Last episode I talked a lot about
growth hormone and thyroid hormone, and I mentioned things like sauna
and exercise, and sleep, and how they can increase levels of growth
hormone within the healthy ranges. And why increasing growth hormone
can be very beneficial because it can burn off body fat, it can
improve muscle and general tissue health, cartilage, et cetera. And we
tend to lose, or our levels of growth hormone are reduced as we age.
Many people asked me, "well, what about fasting?" Everyone's been
promised on the internet that intermittent fasting leads to these big
increases in growth hormone. The reason I didn't mention it is that I
couldn't find a study that actually pointed to the underlying
mechanism. I saw lots of claims, lots of podcasts. Lots of degrees
behind people's names, sometimes biologists, sometimes entirely
different fields talking about this, but very few studies. And then I
found what I would consider the study. We will link to this study.
Turns out that fasting does increase growth hormone levels and the way
that it does it is fascinating. I mentioned in a previous podcast
about hunger and timing of meals and timing of hunger, that when
you're hungry you release a hormone in your body called ghrelin,
sometimes actually called ghrelin. Thanks for all of you
ghrelinisters, or ghrelinisters that corrected my pronunciation, it's
both ghrelin or ghrelin, either one works. Ghrelin makes you hungry,
when blood glucose, your blood sugar is low, ghrelin is secreted and
makes you hungry. And it turns out that ghrelin, this hunger hormone
actually binds to the receptor in the brain that normally binds what's
called growth hormone releasing hormone. So believe it or not the
hunger hormone can act like growth hormone releasing hormone and
thereby stimulate growth hormone. Now the levels of growth hormone
that fasting promotes through this ghrelin system are pretty
substantial. It's about a doubling of growth hormone levels in the
waking state. So we know that you can release growth hormone in sleep,
intermittent fasting it turns out can increase growth hormone by
binding ghrelin to the growth hormone, releasing hormone receptor and
it does it also during the daytime. So yes indeed fasting can increase
growth hormone, not to the super levels that taking growth hormone
would increase it, or that a sauna could increase it, but it does seem
to increase growth hormone. Later in today's episode we're going to
talk a lot about different patterns of fasting and eating that can
control epinephrine. And so we will turn to specifics about how long a
fast. Do you need to fast for two or three days, or 23 hours?
Fortunately for people like me who love to eat, that's not the case.
So we'll talk specific fasting protocols later in the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=716"&gt;Why Your Stomach Growls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also said, we're going to talk about tummy grumble, when your
stomach growls it is not because of fluid sifting around in there. A
lot of people think, Oh, you know it's fluid sifting around. Turns out
that your stomach has smooth muscle that lines it sides and when you
eat something or you don't every once in a while your stomach cinches
off at the two ends like a bag with a hose on either end, 'cause
that's essentially what your digestive system is. And if there's
nothing in there what happens is the muscles that line the sides of
your stomach they kind of extend around the stomach and these cables,
those are always there and if you have food in your stomach, what they
do is they churn your stomach. They literally turn the muscles of your
stomach like a tumbler to help break up the food that presumably you
didn't chew well enough 'cause you were eating too fast. When you
don't have any food in your stomach that churning continues. And that
contraction of the muscle, the turning, literally turning over of your
muscles they don't flip over completely, but the turning over the
muscles, that's what causes the stomach growling. If you don't want to
be the person in the meeting, or sitting there at a in a quiet theater
whose stomach is growling, chew your food better. That's the simple
solution. And last episode, I talked a lot about how sauna,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=789"&gt;Hot Baths &amp;amp; Hormones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;controlled safe hyperthermia can cause huge increases in growth
hormone release anywhere from 300 to 500, even 1600% increases in
growth hormone release. Really staggeringly high increases. I pointed
out that many people don't have saunas in their yard or in their
homes, and they would go through some other measures to increase
safely their body heat. You know, creating a steam room in their
bathroom, or jogging with extra sweats on this kind of thing. Many of
you asked about hot baths, hot bags will increase growth hormone,
however the temperatures that you need in order to increase growth
hormone are high enough that you run the risk of burn. And so I really
can't make any recommendations about hot bath, but if you can tolerate
a nice hot bath you are going to get some growth hormone release.
However, the sauna has this advantage of you being able to enter 175
degree, or 200 degree environment, provided you're not pregnant,
you're not a young child, et cetera. You can do that safely. And
getting big increases in growth hormone. The hot bath will lead to
lesser increases in growth hormone. We're going to talk a lot about
temperature regulation in a future episode, but as always if you're
ever going to start playing with hyperthermia or hypothermia, cold
baths, ice baths, hot showers, hot baths that are beyond the kind of
norm of what's comfortable, you have to be extremely careful and
please consult a doctor. I think it's fair to say that most people
would like to have a lot of energy during the day, if you work during
the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=875"&gt;Energy, Adrenaline (Epinephrine), &amp;amp; Cortisol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they'd like their energy to taper off at night. And I think it's
fair to say that most people don't enjoy being sick. Nobody wants to
get sick. In other words, you want to have energy, and you want your
immune system to function well, to ward off infections of various
kinds, bacterial infections, viral infections, et cetera. And it turns
out that the two hormones that dominate those processes of having
enough energy and having a healthy immune system are cortisol and
epinephrine. Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline. In the body
we tend to call adrenaline adrenaline, and in the brain we tend to
call adrenaline epinephrine. And I'm sorry for that I didn't create
this naming system. And the story behind it is uninteresting and not
worth our time. I will use the words adrenaline and epinephrine
interchangeably today. Cortisol is cortisol. And I just want to cover
a little bit about what cortisol and epinephrine are? Where they are
released in the body and brain? Because if you can understand that you
will understand better how to control them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=948"&gt;Cortisol &amp;amp; Cholesterol, Competition With Testosterone &amp;amp; Estrogen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, cortisol is a steroid hormone much like estrogen and
testosterone in that it is derived from cholesterol. Now that could be
cholesterol that you eat, it could be cholesterol that's produced by
the liver. As many of you probably know the relationship between
dietary cholesterol, the fats that you eat and blood cholesterol, and
liver cholesterol is a very controversial one. It's a barbed wire
topic. There are people that claim that dietary cholesterol has zero
impact on circulating cholesterol coming from the liver, and there are
people who argue the exact opposite, both with good data in hand I
would say. There are some problems for the idea that all your
cholesterol levels are determined by dietary intake. Namely, that
anorexics often have very high levels of cholesterol that their liver
produces, even though they are eating very little and sometimes not
eating at all. So understand that cholesterol is a precursor molecule,
meaning it's the substrate from which a lot of things like
testosterone and estrogen are made. Please also understand that
cholesterol can be made into estrogen, or testosterone, or cortisol.
And that cortisol is sort of the competitive partner to estrogen and
testosterone. What this means is, no matter how much cholesterol
you're eating or you produce, whether or not it's low or it's high, if
you are stressed more of that cholesterol is going to be devoted
toward creating cortisol, which is indeed a stress hormone. However,
the word stress shouldn't stress you out, because you need cortisol,
cortisol is vital. You don't want your cortisol levels to be too low.
It's very important for immune system function, for memory, for not
getting depressed. You just don't want your cortisol levels to be too
high and you don't want them to be elevated even to normal levels at
the wrong time of day. So we're going to talk how to control the
timing and level of your cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=1074"&gt;Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Is Your (Immune Systems) Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epinephrine or adrenaline has also been demonized a bit. We think of
it as the stress hormone, this thing that makes us anxious, fight or
flight. You know, we used to get chased by lions and tigers, and
bears, and now we don't. and it's this ancient hangover, that's all
wrong. The fact of the matter is the epinephrine is your best friend
when it comes to your immunity, when it comes to protecting you from
infection. And we're going to talk about why, and epinephrine
adrenaline is your best friend when it comes to remembering things and
learning and activating neuroplasticity. We're going to talk about
that as well. Once again, it's a question of how much and how long and
the specific timing of release of cortisol and epinephrine, as opposed
to cortisol and adrenaline being good or bad. They're terrific when
they're regulated, they are terrible when they're misregulated. And we
will give you lots of tools to regulate them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=1128"&gt;Cortisol Basics In Two (Actually 1) Minute/s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortisol biology 101 in less than two minutes. Your brain makes what
we call releasing hormones and in this case, there's corticotropin
releasing hormone. CRH is made by neurons in your brain, it causes the
pituitary, this gland that sits about an inch in front of the roof of
your mouth and the base of your brain to release ACTH. ACTH then goes
and causes your adrenals, which sit above your kidneys in your lower
back to release cortisol. A so-called stress hormone, but I would like
you to think about cortisol not as a stress hormone but as a hormone
of energy. It produces a situation in the brain and body whereby you
want to move, and whereby you don't want to rest, and whereby you
don't want to eat at least at first. Epinephrine or adrenaline 101 in
less than two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=1188"&gt;Adrenaline Basics In Two Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sense a stressor with your mind or your body senses a
stressor from a wound or something of that sort. A signal is sent to
neurons that are in the middle of your body. They are called the
sympathetic chain ganglia. The name doesn't necessarily matter. They
release Norepinephrine very quickly. It's almost like a sprinkler
system that just hoses your body with epinephrine. That will increase
heart rate, will increase breathing rate. In some cases it will
constrict your blood vessels, it will also increase the size of
vessels and arteries that are giving blood flow to your vital organs.
This is why your extremities get cold when you're stressed and your
heart is beating faster. More of that energy is being devoted toward
your core. You also release adrenaline from your adrenals, again
riding on top of your kidneys. Those are second system whereby your
system gets flooded with adrenaline in pulses. So you can get one
pulse, you can get 10 pulses. We'll talk about how to regulate the
number of pulses and you release it from an area of your brain called
locus coeruleus, and that creates alertness in your brain. If you want
to learn more about the stress response and all the details of that,
including some protocols of how to regulate stress please see our
episode about stress. I go into a lot of detail there. I will touch on
some of the same themes today, but I really want to cover energy and
the immune system. And if you're very much interested in stress per
say and stress regulation, please see the episode on stress. Okay. So
we have cortisol and we have epinephrine, and their net effect is to
increase energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=1292"&gt;Tool: Time Your Cortisol Peak To Waking Using Specific Light Intensities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first of all, I want to give you a tool that will help you regulate
cortisol and can also help stave off certain patterns of mental
illness. Now of course it's not going to cure mental illness on its
own, but it can support healthy state of mind, and can help reduce
unhealthy states of mind, including depression. So the first tool is
to make sure that your highest levels of cortisol are first thing in
the morning when you wake up. One way or another every 24 hours you
will get an increase in cortisol. That is non-negotiable that is
written into your genome. That increasing cortisol is there to wake
you up and to make you alert, it's to stimulate movement from being
sleep, presumably horizontal, to getting up and starting to move about
your day. And I've said it before, but I will say it again the best
way to stimulate that increase in cortisol at the appropriate time is
that very soon after waking within 30 minutes or so after waking, get
outside view some sunlight, even if it's overcast, get outside view
some sunlight, no sunglasses. Never look at any light so bright that
it could damage your eyes, but do that for two to 10 minutes. If it's
very bright two minutes, if it's not so bright 10 minutes. Do that,
because in the early part of the day you have the opportunity to time
that cortisol release to the early part of the day, which will
improve, this has been backed by peer reviewed studies, it will
improve your focus, it will improve your energy levels, and it will
improve your learning throughout the day. It will also prevent a late
shift in cortisol increase. And late shifted cortisol, meaning
cortisol that increases around 8:00 or 9:00 PM is a signature feature
of many depressive disorders, including major depression, anxiety. And
that of course correlates with things like insomnia, et cetera. So
that's a key tool, and I don't know how many of you are already doing
that, but it is vital to do. Now I mentioned sunlight even on cloudy
days and there are specific reasons for that. So I want to just
briefly cover the data because in the episodes on sleep, I talked
about brightness of light in regulating cortisol and sleep. And I
talked about how to measure lux, brightness, but I was not specific
enough I realized based on the questions that I've received since that
episode. So here's how it works, going outside and getting some
sunlight requires that I also tell you how long and under what
conditions. I've said looking through a window is not as good, it
takes 50 times longer to get as much light, et cetera, et cetera.
Many, many questions have told me that I'm not being specific enough.
So I'm going to give you the data and from the data you will
understand exactly how long you need to do this each day. On a sunny
day, so no cloud cover, provided that the sun is not yet overhead.
It's somewhere low in the sky could have just crossed the horizon, or
if you wake up a little bit later it could be somewhat low in the sky.
Basically the intensity of light, the brightness, is somewhere around
100,000 Lux. Lux is just a measurement of brightness. If you want to
download the app Light Meter, that is a free app that will allow you
to do that. You can hold your finger down on the little button there
and you can move it around, and it will continuously give you a Lux
read out. It's not perfect, it's not exact, but it's pretty good. and
it is zero cost. I have no relationship to Light Meter the company. On
a cloudy day it's about 10,000 Lux. Okay. So tenfold reduction. But
bright artificial light, very bright artificial light is somewhere
around 1000 lux. And ordinary room light is somewhere around 100-200
lux. And it has to do with how much light scatter there is. So even if
you have a very bright bulb sitting right next to you, that's not
going to do the job. Your phone will not do the job not early in the
day to get the cortisol released at the appropriate time you need to
get outside. So let's just set a couple general parameters. If it's
bright outside and no cloud cover that light can be indirect. You
don't have to be staring into the sun, please don't damage your eyes.
We can't regenerate those neurons yet and restore vision that's lost,
but if you have to blink, that means it's too bright. It's fine to
blink of course, please do if you need to. Get outside for 10 minutes,
or five minutes should suffice, but 10 minutes is sure to suffice. If
it's a cloudy day, dense overcast, you're probably going to need about
30 minutes. If it's light cloud broken cloud cover it's probably going
to be somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes. And if you can't get
outside or you're on an airplane and it's bright overhead, artificial
lights or ordinary room lights it's going to take you about six hours
of light. And by time you reach the middle of your sort of wakeful
period, it's too late. You won't be able to shift your clock and your
cortisol will start drifting later and later. This is why it's vital
to get this light on a regular basis, to get that cortisol released
early in the day. That sets you up for optimal levels of energy, it
sets you up for great sleep. But today's not really about sleep it's
more about energy that cortisol pulse and the stress that you might
feel early in the day from having a little bit extra energy. That is
the energy that you want in order to move about and learn, and do
various things. That is a healthy level of energy. So please try and
get that sunlight. If it's within your protocols to do that, and try
and get sufficient sunlight first thing in the morning, again within
the first hour. That's the best way to make sure that you time your
cortisol appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=1640"&gt;Brief Increases In Cortisol &amp;amp; Adrenaline Boost Energy, Focus &amp;amp; Immunity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now throughout the day you're going to experience different things.
Most of you are not spending your entire day trying to optimize your
health. Some of you might be, but most of you have jobs and you have
families, and you have commitments. Life enters the picture and
provides you stressors, and those stressors, whatever they may happen
to be, a difficult coworker, some disappointment about something, you
didn't get the raise you expected, or you didn't get the vacation that
you expected. Those will cause increases in cortisol and epinephrine.
This is important to understand, you don't have the luxury of just
having this morning cortisol and then having a taper off. You want
that major cortisol early in the day but then you can expect, you
should expect increases in cortisol and adrenaline throughout the day
based on events that are unpleasant to you. So for me, the events that
are most unpleasant to me are things like traffic, emails that ask me
to fill out a form for which I can't find the link. These kinds of
things stress me out, I'm a human being. I don't lose my cool over
them but I can feel my level of alertness and kind of frustration
increased. The normal kind of things that go with stress tense up a
little bit. The key is these blips in cortisol and epinephrine need to
be brief. You can't have them so often or lasting so long that you are
in a state of chronic cortisol elevation or chronic epinephrine
elevation. This system of stress was designed to increase your
alertness and mobilize you towards things, get you frustrated, and
provide the opportunity to change behavior. That's what they were
designed to do. So if you find yourself getting stressed and staying
stressed, there are great tools that we provide in the stress episode
that relate to things like the double inhale exhale, the so-called
physiological sigh. You can incorporate NSDR, in non sleep deep rest
protocol, et cetera. But understand that the energy that you
experienced during stress, that sudden increase in alertness and
attention that comes from seeing something difficult. That is a
healthy hormonal system and neural system that's working. And the
reason it works is that cortisol when it's released into the
bloodstream it actually can bind to receptors in the brain. It can
bind receptors in the amygdala, fear centers and threat detection
centers, but also areas of the brain that are involved in learning,
and memory, and neuroplasticity. And this is why I say that
neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change itself in response to
experience is first stimulated by attention and focus and often a low-
level state of agitation. So understand that, and you won't be quite
so troubled about the little stress increases that you experience
throughout the day. Now, there are ways to leverage stress,
epinephrine and cortisol in ways that serve you and to do it in a
deliberate way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=1804"&gt;Ways To Increase Adrenaline, Epinephrine &amp;amp; Cortisol &amp;amp; Why That Is Good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also ways to do that that increase your level of stress
threshold, meaning they make it less likely that epinephrine and
cortisol will be released. So I want to talk about the science of
those practices, 'cause I get asked about these practices a lot.
Things like Wim Hof breathing which is also called tummo breathing.
Things like ice baths. Things like high intensity interval training.
All of those things have utility. The question is how you use them and
how often you use them. Those tools just like stress from a life event
can either enhance your immunity or deplete it. That's right those
same practices of ice baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval
training, or training of any kind can deplete your immune system or it
can improve them. Excuse me, they can improve it, meaning they can
improve your immune system. The key is how often you use them and
when, and so I want to review that now in light of the scientific
literature, because in doing that you can build practices into your
daily or maybe every other day routine that can really help buffer you
against unhealthy levels of cortisol and epinephrine. Meaning cortisol
increases that are much too great, or that lasts much too long.
Epinephrine increases that are much too great, or that last much too
long. And of course we'll talk about all the negatives that go along
with having too much cortisol, too much epinephrine for too long. But
you hear about those a lot. You hear about Cushing syndrome, you hear
about abdominal fat accumulation. You hear about sleep disturbances. I
want to arm you with the tools first and then we can talk about the
dark side, and all the things that hopefully you'll be able to avoid
entirely, or that you can get yourself out of once you have the tools
in hand. Let's say somebody tells you something very troubling, or you
look at your phone and you see a text message that's really upsetting
to you. That will cause an immediate increase in epinephrine
adrenaline in your brain and body. And chances are it's going to
increase your levels of cortisol as well. Let's say you get into an
ice bath or a cold shower, even if you love the cold, or if you hate
the cold, that will cause an equivalent increase in epinephrine and
cortisol. We don't know the exact levels but it's probably about the
same. Let's say you go out for high intensity interval training, you
decide you're going to run some sprints, you do some repeats, or
you're going to do some weightlifting in the gym and you love lifting
weights in the gym. Maybe you like the power lifting thing, or you
decide that you want to do some hot yoga, or some thing that you
really enjoy, or you hate, you're going to increase your epinephrine
and cortisol levels. There's simply no way around this. Let's say you
decide to sit down and you're going to do some deep breathing. We all
hear about the benefits of deep breathing. So inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale. You're going to get big increases in epinephrine and cortisol.
The data from multiple studies support this. All of those are
stressors in air quotes. Now there is a way that you can cognitively
reframe what those are. You can tell yourself I love high intensity
interval training, or I love weight training. I personally love
exercise. I'm not crazy about the cold, I do some cold exposure stuff
now and again, and we're going to talk a lot about how to do that in
the optimal way in an upcoming episode. But you know, getting into the
cold doesn't feel good to me. I tell myself it's good for me and I
enjoy it at some point usually when I'm getting out. All of those
increase epinephrine and guess what, they increase your levels of
energy and alertness. So if you're somebody who struggles with energy
and alertness it can be beneficial, provided you get clearance from
your doctor to have some sort of protocol built into your day where
you deliberately increase your levels of epinephrine and your levels
of cortisol. And I want to put the emphasis on deliberately. So how
would you do that? Well, it's quite easy to turn the shower cold and
get into that, that will wake you up. And it literally wakes you up
because of increases in epinephrine. You can do deep breathing of the
sort where you inhale and exhale repeatedly 25 or 30 times, maybe hold
your breath for a few seconds on an exhale and then repeat, so-called
Wim Hoff, or tummo type breathing. Lots of adrenaline is released into
your system when you do that. You will have more energy afterwards. So
it's really important to understand that the body doesn't distinguish
between a troubling text message, ice, tummo breathing, or high
intensity interval training, or any other kind of exercise, it's all
stress. Cognitively reframing that and telling yourself I like this, I
enjoy it. Is not going to change the way that that molecule impacts
your body and brain. I sort of chuckle because people would love to
tell you that all you have to do is say, "Oh, this is good for me."
No. What it does to tell yourself that it's good for you or that you
enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=2100"&gt;Does Mindset During Stress Matter?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that it liberates other molecules like dopamine and serotonin that
help buffer the epinephrine response. Now, the way that it does that,
I've talked about in previous episode, but I'll just mention that
dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine. Epinephrine, adrenaline is
made from dopamine, okay? Cortisol is made from cholesterol.
Epinephrine is made from dopamine. And that's why if you tell yourself
you're enjoying something, and because dopamine is so subjective that
you can in some ways, as long as you're not completely lying to
yourself, you can get more epinephrine, you get more mileage or more
ability to push through something. And you can sort of reframe it, but
it's not really cognitive reframing. The cognitive part is the
trigger, but it's a chemical substance that's actually occurring
there. It's dopamine giving you more epinephrine, A bigger amplitude
epinephrine release, and it gives you some sense of control. So here's
a protocol that anyone can use. If you want to increase levels of
energy, if you suffer from low energy during the daytime, or whenever
it is that you'd like to be alert. Pick a practice that you can do
fairly consistently,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=2175"&gt;Protocols: Adrenaline Breathing Described&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe every day, but maybe every third day or every fourth day, maybe
it's an ice bath or a cold bath. Maybe it's a cold shower. Maybe it's
the cyclic inhale exhale, breathing protocol I described, if that
wasn't clear and people always ask for a demo, I'm not going to do the
whole thing right now, but I'm willing to do a few rounds of this, or
a few cycles I should say. So it's inhale. I would do that more
deeply, more like. You do that 25, 30 times repeatedly you will start
to feel warm. People in the yoga community, they say you're generating
heat. You're not generating heat, releasing adrenaline. Inhale and
exhale, inhale exhale 25 or 30 times, you will feel agitated and
stressed. That's because you're releasing adrenaline in your body and
that's because you're releasing norepinephrine in your brain, and
you'll be more alert. Then you can follow that 25 or 30 breath cycles
with an exhale hold, and hold your breath for 15 to 30 seconds.
Always, always, always do this on dry land. Never while driving,
operating heavy machinery, all the standard safety protocols. Never
near water please, people have passed out and died doing this with
breath holds in water. There are several deaths associated with it, on
land it's probably safer, clear with your doctor, but 25, 30 breaths
exhale hold, 25, 30 breasts again exhale hold, 25 30 breasts again
exhale hold. And then if you like you can do an inhale and hold if
that's within your margins of safety. So if all these protocols, all
these activities are just equivalent, they're just stress. Then how do
we make them good for us? How do we actually benefit from them? Now,
of course the cold itself can have some health promoting effects. It
can increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism, high intensity
interval training, or other forms of exercise of course has
cardiovascular effects that can be good for us as does weight
training, et cetera. But what we're talking about here are ways to
increase energy and to teach our brain and body to teach ourselves how
to regulate the stress response. So in addition to the benefits of the
actual practices what we're talking about is building a system so that
when you experience increases in epinephrine and cortisol from life
events you're able to better buffer those. And we are also talking
about ways that you can increase energy overall. 'Cause that's what
today's episode is all about, energy and the immune system. And
indeed, we will talk about how you can actually leverage specific
protocols to increase your immune system on demand. There's great
scientific data to support that one can do that. So there's a
biological mechanism that's very important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=2340"&gt;Practices To Increase Energy Without Increasing Stress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you want to do those things, increase energy and your immune system
on demand. Learn to buffer stress on demand in real time. And it means
taking these protocols, these practices whether or not it's cold
water, or ice bath, or exercise, or any of those and making one small
but very powerful adjustment in how you perform them. But in order to
make that adjustment, I can't just tell you the adjustment. I have to
tell you the mechanism so that you know if you're doing it correctly
or not. This is really a case where if you can understand a little bit
of mechanism, you will be far better off than just adopting protocols.
So if you take away nothing else from this episode except what I'm
about to tell you please take away the information I'm about to tell
Cortisol as I mentioned is released from the adrenals and it can bind
to receptors. It can have action, both in the body and in the brain.
In fact, it can bind to the so-called threat detection center in the
brain, or one of them which is the amygdala, also called the fear
center. It can do that because cortisol can cross the blood brain
barrier. It can be released in the body and cross this biological
barrier. It's like a fence that keeps things out of the brain but
cortisol has passing rights, it can go through. Epinephrine cannot,
epinephrine is polarized, the shape of it is such that it can't make
it through the blood brain barrier. That's one of the reasons why it's
released both from the adrenals in your body and released from this
brainstem area, the locus coeruleus in your brain. That's a powerful
thing, because what it means is that the body can enter states of
readiness and alertness while the mind remains calm. That is
biologically possible, it's not just a psychological trick. And there
are ways that one can do that. So I'm presuming at this point that
you're getting your morning light to time your cortisol increase. I'm
presuming that you want more energy or that you want to increase your
immune system, its function and its ability to combat infections of
various kinds. And what I'm suggesting is that you pick from the
pallet of exercises that are out there, or tools that are out there to
increase epinephrine. There are a lot of ways to do that. You can do
that as I mentioned through cold water, through exercise. You can even
do that by having confrontations with other people. At a biological
level, it is identical. So if you like to go online and place the kind
of comments or read the kinds of things, or look at the kinds of
things that agitate you, you can if you like look at that as an
opportunity, I'm not suggesting you do that, I'd like to see people
taking care of themselves and each other in much less destructive ways
frankly. But the prerequisite here is getting an increase in
adrenaline released from the body. Now the simplest way to describe
how to do that would be in the context of cold water or a breathing
protocol, because then I don't have to deal with the unknown life
circumstances that get you triggered, or I could say what gets me
triggered but I'm not going to. So let's presume cold water. So let's
say you decide you're going to take a cold shower. You get into the
cold shower and if it's cold enough, that will be stressful, you will
experience an increase in epinephrine, it will increase your
alertness. Now you're using this as a practice, as a tool to build you
could call it resilience, but the ability to stay calm in the mind
while being stressed in the body, epinephrine is in the body. And you
do that by subjectively trying to calm yourself. Now you can do that
by telling yourself it's good for you by emphasizing your exhales.
Anything that you can do to try and stay calm despite the fact that
you are in a heightened state of alertness. You do this with exercise,
you can do this with music. Pretty much anything that will give you a
really heightened state of alertness offers you the opportunity to try
and stay calm in the mind. What you're trying to do at a mechanistic
level is to have adrenaline released from the adrenals, but not have
adrenaline, epinephrine released from the brain stem to the same
degree. So you're not just trying to buffer this, you're not trying to
say, "Oh, this is good for me, this is good for me, I'm going to grind
this out." You're not trying to grind it out, you're trying to move
through this calmly while maintaining alertness. You're not trying to
zone out necessarily, although maybe that helps. You're not trying to
distract yourself, what you're trying to do is shift cognitively your
relationship to the somatic, to the body stress response. Now I'm sure
some of you out there are shouting, "Yeah, that's exactly like
whatever, whatever, whatever." I agree. This is in many ways a self-
directed kind of stress inoculation, but we're not talking about this
as stress inoculation. We're talking about this as a way to increase
energy and focus. And the reason is that epinephrine when released in
the body has a profound effect on the immune system. And when released
in the brain has a profound effect on the ability to learn and
remember information and to be alert. And so we're talking about
splitting the location, separating the location from which you have
epinephrine, adrenaline released. Okay. So let's say you are doing
this practice simply to wake up, okay, cold shower will do that,
exercise will do that. The ability to stay calm in mind while having
heightened levels of adrenaline and presumably cortisol as well in the
body. But the cortisol is going to circulate everywhere. We'll talk a
little bit about cortisol more in a moment. You could do that through
some self soothing calming way, that's going to be highly individual.
You can do it by telling yourself you enjoy it, et cetera. But what
you need to understand is that in the immediate period following that
practice your system, your entire brain and body are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=2700"&gt;Using Stressors to ENHANCE Our Immune System: Science &amp;amp; Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body is actually primed to resist infection, when you have high
levels of epinephrine in it for short periods of time. So the
scientific study that explored how increasing adrenaline in the body
can improve immune resistance is grounded in a well-known phenomenon
that increases in stress actually protect you against infection in the
short term. So I want to look at the classic data first, describe what
was done. And then I want to talk about the more recent study which is
immediately actionable. There are classic set of studies that are
really based mainly on the work of somebody named Bruce McEwen, who
was at the Rockefeller University in New York. Bruce passed away a few
years ago, but he had many decades of incredibly impactful work under
his belt when he did. The work that I'm going to talk about next has
been done in humans and has been done in animals, and has really
explored how inducing stress can enhance the function of the immune
system in the short term. And when, I mean short term, I mean about
one to four days. I'm not going to go through all the details of the
study, but essentially what they were doing was exposing subjects to
some sort of infection, either bacterial or viral infection, and
inducing stress. It sounds like a double whammy, right? You'd think
that maybe getting a little electric foot shock, or cold water
exposure, or something to increase your levels of stress and
adrenaline would just make the effects of the infection worse, but no,
quite the opposite. Brief bouts of stress, which now you should be
thinking about in terms of cortisol and epinephrine release we're
actually able to increase immune system function. Now that shouldn't
surprise you if you understand a little bit about how epinephrine
works in the body and in the brain. It essentially is the signal by
which the nervous system can inform immune organs, things like the
spleen and other organs that make killer cells of various kinds, B
cells and T cells, to go in combat infections, bacteria, and viruses.
How else would your immune system know that there was an infection?
Your immune system can recognize foreign invaders but the nervous
system provides the signal, the sort of alarm signal that liberates
the killer cells, that tells them there's a problem and to go seek out
the problem so to speak. So the duration here is really important
because if stress stayed too high for too long, then yes indeed stress
can hinder the immune response. But for a period of about one to four
days, it actually can protect you by way of increasing the immune
response. Now, I can say with certainty that that effect is governed
by epinephrine, adrenaline released from the adrenals and not from the
brain, because they actually explored whether or not the effect exists
in the presence of what's called an adrenalectomy, or removing the
adrenals. So I should just say, without the adrenals you don't get the
effect. So we know that that effect comes from adrenaline in the body.
What does that mean for you? That means if you want to increase your
immune system in the short term you want to increase your epinephrine
in the short-term. That's why short bouts of very intense exercise
probably no more than an hour per day, provided you're doing
everything else right, sleeping and nutrition, et cetera, maybe even
shorter bouts of intense exercise or exposure to cold water, or that
cyclical breathing that I talked about before, because they increase
epinephrine they will bolster the immune system. And we all hear these
reports every once in a while, it seems to be the thing that every
once in a while there'll be an article about how coffee can improve
your immune system, or something like that. Indeed caffeine can
increase epinephrine and dopamine to some extent, but most people are
drinking it chronically. So its effects are probably due to increases
in epinephrine and probably whether or not something like coffee or
other forms of caffeine can improve or degrade your immune system will
probably depend on whether or not you're using it in a way that it
increases your adrenaline as a spike, that happens rarely, you know,
once every two or three months, let's say you have an infection coming
on, yes, indeed. What these data probably mean is that drinking some
hot caffeinated tea or some hot coffee even provided you don't get
dehydrated from it because you're also drinking some water can
probably improve your immune system function, by way of increasing
adrenaline release. But so can the breathing, so can cold exposure, so
can exercise. The mechanism here is what's key, and I keep saying that
because what it means is that you don't actually have to know the
specific protocol. I'm not trying to say, do this particular protocol.
You have to figure out, and it should be easy to figure out what short
term adrenaline increasing behavior you're willing to do on a regular
basis every day, or two or three times a week. Now you could say,
well, I'm not sick. Should I be doing these things often? I would say,
two or three times a week at a minimum if your goal is to keep your
immune system tuned up and you are in the presence of a lot of
children for instance, which carry a lot of bugs, because their immune
system isn't developed, or you work in a healthcare setting, or you're
simply somebody who's prone to get sick. I can just say anecdotally, I
guess someone now calls this anecdata which I don't like that phrase,
because it's sort of... I don't want anecdotal data to ever be
misunderstood as anything but anecdotal data. Anecdotally, I can say
that I've had instances where I've felt a throat tickle coming on or
some sinus infection, I will do the cyclic breathing that I described
before. 25, 30 breasts exhale hold, 25 30 breasts exhale hold, 25, 30
breaths exhale hold, and then big inhale hold. And most times I didn't
get full blown sick, but I also take other precautionary measures to
get sleep, et cetera. So whether or not it was causal, or whether or
not it's just correlated I don't know. However, there's a human study
that I definitely want to point out to you, because it was published
more recently than the McEwen work. It was published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for the USA, because
there are Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for many
other countries as well. The title of the paper is "Voluntary
activation of the sympathetic nervous system." That's the system that
causes fight or flight AKA stress, and causes release of adrenaline.
"And attenuation of the innate immune response in humans." This is Kox
et al. PNAS, Proceedings to the National Academy of sciences, 2014.
And they incorporate the ever famous Wim Hof breathing Wim Hof
breathing is much like the breathing protocol that I've described
several times now in this podcast. It's also called tummo breathing.
Other people from other cultures and communities have called it other
things. The naming really isn't important. Although I do think Wim is
a pioneer in trying to bring these practices to the general public
more broadly and was involved in this study. The study was done in the
Netherlands. It was communicated by Dr. Tamas Horvath at Yale, I
mentioned all that. Horvath is a terrific scientist, I'm familiar with
his work over many years. Here's what they did. They injected people
with E. coli and they had groups that either did the sorts of
breathing I've been describing that increase adrenaline release.
Although I should say, I don't think you need that breathing to get
adrenaline release. You could do it with cold exposure, you could do
it with other things, high intensity interval training as well. And
what they found was that the response to the E. coli was quite
different in the people that had a protocol, in this case breathing to
increase adrenaline. So this is a remarkable study because what they
found was that the fever, the vomiting, the all the negative effects
of E. coli, many of them and some cases all of them were greatly
attenuated by way of engaging the adrenaline system. In this case
using breathing. They looked at inflammatory cytokines, things like
IL-6, which I've mentioned many times on this podcast. This are
classic inflammatory cytokine were reduced. Things like IL-10 which
are anti-inflammatory were increased. There were some inflammatory
cytokines that were increased. What's the point here? The point is you
can control your immune system, by finding a way that you can increase
adrenaline. And this runs counter to what we always hear, which is
don't get too stressed or you will get sick. Learn to control
adrenaline, turn it on and turn it off. Learn to control cortisol,
turn it on with light in the morning, try and turn it off and then
when it spikes because of life events learn to turn it off. Learning
to turn on and off adrenaline, AKA epinephrine, and learning to turn
on and off cortisol affords you the ability to turn on energy and
focus in your immune system. That's the most important point from
today's podcast and understanding that it doesn't matter what protocol
you use. Maybe it's a cup of coffee and running up a hill five or six
times, that will improve your immune system function if you get
adrenaline in your system. You can use an ice bath, you can use a cold
bath, it really doesn't matter. You get into an argument, but I'm not
suggesting you do that, it really doesn't matter. What's important is
that you're able to then shut off that response. And there are ways to
do that we will talk about, but I want to talk about some of the other
benefits of epinephrine and cortisol that occur because of their
actions on the brain. Because these are many and they are powerful,
and they relate to energy, but also the ability to learn. If I haven't
already convinced you that seeing light early in the day is good for
timing your cortisol. I should also mention that another hormone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=3311"&gt;Timing Thyroid Release For Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that I discussed last episode which is thyroid hormone and is critical
for setting your level of metabolism is controlled in part by these
circadian mechanisms and cortisol itself. The short takeaway on this
is that if you get your cortisol release early in the day it will
increase your energy throughout the day, it will also time your
thyroid release properly. So there's yet another reason why you would
want to get that light exposure early in the day. For me that's a non-
negotiable practice. If I'm on a plane, I'll try and get it any way I
can. I'm not shining flashlights in my eyes yet, but I really try hard
to get that light exposure from sunlight early in the day without
fail. And the thyroid increase has to do with the fact that your
circadian clock itself is regulated by cortisol and the circadian
clock times the release of thyroid hormone. I don't want to go too far
off in that direction, but there are a number of studies, Kalsbeek et
al. Kalsbeek et al. 2012. If you want to look it up on PubMed is a
great one, that describes how cortisol secretion begins to rise during
sleep and peaks shortly after waking or immediately before. And that
times a set of neurons in the circadian clock that then trigger the
release of the releasing and stimulating hormones for thyroid. So a
really important mechanism, and thyroid will also tend to correlate
with energy but mostly metabolism. Very important to have thyroid in
check. Now let's talk about epinephrine and cortisol, and learning and
memory. Everyone has a story about being so stressed they couldn't
remember something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=3422"&gt;Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance &amp;amp; Memory. IF They Are After Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, sit down to an exam. I actually had this happen once sat
down to an exam and just blanked, just blanked. It only happened once,
I don't know what happened. I don't think it was sleep deprivation but
I just completely blanked. And it was very hard for me to pull myself
out of that ditch. I did manage to do it, but it was a scary
experience. So I think most people think about stress and an inability
to perform. However, most of the time increases in epinephrine
provided they are not through the roof lead to improved performance.
Now this has been shown over and over again on memory tests, on
learning new information, on physical performance. That when blood
levels of epinephrine are low you don't perform very well. When blood
levels of epinephrine are very high up to about 1500 to 1700 pg/mL. If
anyone's out there, who's actually measuring this stuff but I doubt
you are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better when you are
alert and when you're a little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again,
and again, and again. If you get too stressed, it's the mental side,
it's the epinephrine in the brain that causes people to either focus
on their somatic response too much. Like they feel like they're
sweating, and they're focused on their bodily response, they're not
focused on what it is they're trying to do, or say, or perform, et
cetera, or learn. But epinephrine is a nootropic, it is a smart drug
that we all make internally, and cortisol is as well. Now here's the
twist that does not mean that you want epinephrine high during the
exam necessarily. Memory and learning and performance are actually
favored, they are enhanced by epinephrine increases immediately after
learning. And that's something that's rarely discussed, the timing is
vital. So if you learn some information, you have a conversation
you're trying to learn a new language, a new motor skill. Whatever it
is that you're trying to learn, the increase in epinephrine that
occurs just afterward is what's going to consolidate the information.
It's going to ensure that the proper circuits and mechanisms in the
brain for neuroplasticity are engaged during sleep later that night or
the next night which is when the real rewiring occurs. And You might
say, "That's crazy, why would that happen?" Well, we have to remember,
none of these mechanisms evolved for us to do what we want and learn
what we want necessarily although they will allow us to do that. We've
experienced this before, we might have gotten up, gone outside get in
our car, drive to work or to somebody's house you're not thinking
about much at all, and then all of a sudden you see an accident on the
road. Your alertness is primed if it happens to be a particularly gory
accident, there's going to be a lot of sensory information there. All
of a sudden the adrenaline, epinephrine is released into your brain
and body. Guess what? Not only will you not forget that event, but you
will remember everything that led up to that event which has an
adaptive function, because your brain and body's primary concern is
safety, right? This is the neuro-biological explanation for Maslow's
hierarchy of needs is safety first. And so you have heightened
awareness and alertness for everything that preceded that spike in
adrenaline and cortisol. So the way to think about this is if you need
to learn something better, if you're taking Adderall, or you're taking
a lot of coffee beforehand you're actually driving the process in the
wrong direction. You're increasing epinephrine for learning sure, but
past a certain point you're actually degrading learning and
performance. The time to do that is toward the end or immediately
after the learning, because this mechanism is not simply devoted to
negative events like a car crash or a trauma, it works to make sure
that the hippocampus that encodes memories as part of the memory and
coding mechanisms is primed. That it's told what you just experienced
is important, you're going to need that information later. And so I've
talked many times before about using non sleep deep rest NSDR, or
ensuring good night's sleep after learning. But what we're also
talking about is as the learning event tapers off, as you're exiting
that, to make sure that your epinephrine levels are not tapering off
as well. And this may be one of the reasons why the 90 minute cycle,
the so-called ultradian cycle for learning works, because it takes a
few minutes to get into rhythm of learning. You can maintain that
alertness for about 90 minutes, it's no coincidence that these
podcasts are typically about 90 minutes long. And as you exit that 90
minutes you're going to start to feel fatigued. You're not going to be
able to continue to secrete epinephrine at the same level. So I'm not
telling you that at the end of this podcast you should give yourself a
foot shock, or that you should jump into an ice bath. Although I will
say, if you were to increase your epinephrine at the end of this
episode by breathing or by way of cold shower, I'm willing to bet
based on numerous published studies that the memory for the
information would be enhanced. Because of this retroactive effect of
epinephrine and cortisol. Put simply you can remember things better if
you increase your alertness, AKA your level of epinephrine and
cortisol after, immediately after something that you want to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=3765"&gt;An Optimal Learning Protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm reminded by people here at the Huberman Lab Podcast that the
optimal strategy therefore would be a 90 minute session of focus or
learning then immediately after cold shower or tummo type breathing,
or ice bath or something of that sort, maybe a hard run, or hit
training if you can't get access to the other things. And then shower
up and do a non sleep deep rest, and then get a good night's sleep.
Those would be the optimal tools and the organization of tools for
enhanced learning. And of course you could use caffeine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=3800"&gt;Coffee Changes Your Brain &amp;amp; Increases Connectivity Of “Anxiety Circuits”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to prime the whole process by drinking the caffeine towards the tail
of the learning episode, which is counter-intuitive at least to me. I
should mention since many of you use caffeine and I use caffeine. I do
drink coffee, I love mushroom coffee. I love mate. I drink caffeine
and various forms. There was a study that came out recently that is
relevant to our discussion about energy and alertness, and learning.
And the study came out just recently March 2021, it's Maglhaes et al.
So MAGALHAES. And it was published in molecular psychiatry which is a
fine journal, a peer review journal. And the title pretty much gives
it away, "Habitual coffee drinkers display a distinct pattern of brain
functional conductivity." Chronically drinking coffee changes brain
conductivity. And it does it in a number of ways but the key takeaways
from this study, as it relates to sort of what the circuits do as
opposed to me just listing off a bunch of brain circuits, which is
kind of meaningless in this conversation is that people who drank
coffee habitually every day had changes in their brain circuitry, such
that there was a shift or a bias toward anxiety even when they don't
ingest caffeine. So a lot of times we think, Oh caffeine increases
your levels of anxiety. And indeed it appears it does if you use it
chronically, but not just to caffeine, it doesn't just raise your
baseline of anxiety because of what circulating in your bloodstream.
It actually increases connectivity between the brain areas that relate
to anxiety. Now that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on
how you look at it. For people that have are prone to chronic panic
attacks or anxiety attacks that's not going to be good. Some people
might use caffeine in healthy ways. I believe I do in order to just
increase overall levels of alertness. Although now not only am I going
to start delaying my caffeine intake till two hours after I wake up
for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes, but I'm also going
to start drinking it later in learning and focus sessions as a way to
enhance plasticity around those learning and focus sessions, not
before. So interesting study, it's free online. You can access the
full paper online, we will put a link as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=3943"&gt;Nootropics: Two Kinds, &amp;amp; How &amp;amp; Why They Work, “Neural Energy”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to mention this issue of nootropics, so-called smart drugs.
Which is not a topic that I particularly enjoy because I don't like
the name. I don't like the idea of a nootropic, because what is a
smart drug? Well, there's different kinds of smart, there's
creativity, there's task switching, their strategy building, their
strategy implementation. And most of the nootropics that are out there
just cocktails of a bunch of different things that aren't tailored to
the individual at all. They all seem to have some caffeine, or some
culinary trick stimulation, et cetera. But there's an important way to
frame this in light of today's conversation. Nootropics generally fall
into two categories, one category are nootropics that increase blood
glucose. So these are compounds that people take they increased blood
glucose and increasing in blood glucose will improve performance, and
can enhance learning in some situations. I'm not suggesting people
take these things, but here's just a list of a few of those. Some of
them are legal, some of them are gray market, some of them are
illegal. piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, all the Tams, okay.
Elevate blood glucose that's how they work. The neural effects that
you hear are secondary or tertiary to the fact that they just
increased blood glucose. We know that because if you block the blood
glucose effect you block the nootropic effect, okay. Others include,
and definitely don't take these please, amphetamine, cocaine. Those
will increase learning in the short term in particular dosages, but
because they increase blood glucose. And then of course, things like
painful stimuli or stress will improve learning by way of increasing
blood glucose. Now stress and epinephrine that's associated with it
not only improve performance during the learning about, but as I
mentioned before having epinephrine come up afterward will increase
the retention of that information in the longterm. And then of course,
there's a whole category of nootropics that don't impact blood
glucose, that work by increasing the cholinergic system activity. And
these are things like choline, lecithin, Physostigmine, it's a
prescription drug, phosphodiesterase. So there're ways to increase
energy that don't require increase in blood glucose, and this is a
vitally important. The reason we're talking about epinephrine and
cortisol for increasing energy and immune system function is because
they are largely independent of blood glucose. Of course, they
interact with that system, but we heard so much growing up you need to
eat for energy, but the energy that we're talking about today is
actually a much more powerful one than the one that you derive from
food, We could call it neural energy. It's neurotransmitters that
create alertness, and focus, and the willingness and the ability to
move. And the willingness and ability for immune system to move in
response to intruders. So I think we all too often think about food as
energy which is great because it is, but there are other sources of
energy that are neural and they relate to these hormone systems,
cortisol and epinephrine. And that's why we're focused on today. So up
until now we've been talking about increasing energy and increasing
the immune system by way of cortisol and epinephrine, but I'd be
totally remiss if I didn't cover how cortisol and epinephrine if
chronically elevated, or if elevated too high can have a lot of
detrimental effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=4140"&gt;Biology of Comfort Foods: From Negative to Positive Feedback Loops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things we normally hear about. I'm going to describe
some of those things but I'm also going to talk about ways to
ameliorate them. Ways that you can adjust the cortisol levels, even if
you're stressed. Ways that you can adjust epinephrine levels even if
you're stressed so that they have less of a negative impact. I don't
have to list off all the ways that stress is terrible and chronic
stress is terrible I think you know. Insomnia, your immune system over
time will get battered and you won't be able to fight infection off as
well, right? You don't want to be stressed for too long. You can start
laying down the sort of classic pattern of cortisol induced body fat.
In fact, there's a whole literature related to comfort foods and why
we want to consume comfort foods under conditions of chronic stress.
And it's quite interesting actually, because it reveals something
about the biology of chronic stress that's informative for how to
prevent it, or to down regulate chronic stress once it's occurred. So
let's talk for a second about comfort foods and the work that I'm
going to refer to is work that was done by a very impressive scientist
by the name of Mary Dallman. Her work goes back decades. She was at
University of California San Francisco, and she asked this question
that on the face of it seems kind of obvious, but for which there was
no mechanism known until Mary and her lab personnel came along. And
the question was, why do we seek high-fat and or high sugar foods when
we are stressed for awhile? Why would that be? And the reason is that
the so-called glucocorticoids of which cortisol is a glucocorticoid.
It's caused as we've mentioned before, by releasing hormones from the
brain, and ACTH from the pituitary, et cetera. But normally high
levels of glucocorticoid shut off the releasing hormones in the brain
and in the pituitary, they shut down in a so-called negative feedback
loop. So just like if testosterone or estrogen get too high that's
read out or that is seen so to speak by neurons in the pituitary and
brain and then we shut down our production of estrogen and
testosterone. If cortisol levels get too high, if there's too much
cortisol floating around in our bloodstream, there's a negative
feedback loop, and the brain and pituitary shutdown, CRH and ACTH
which would otherwise stimulate more cortisol, so cortisol levels go
down. So it's a beautiful negative feedback loop. Chronic stress
however, stress that lasts more than four to seven days and there's a
way to think about what chronic stress really is in an actionable way,
'causes changes in the feedback loop between the adrenals and the
brain and the pituitary. Such that now the brain and the pituitary
respond to high levels of glucocorticoids cortisol by releasing more
of them. It becomes a positive feedback loop and that's bad it
actually gets right down to levels of gene regulation and
transcription and translation. And so you really don't want chronic
stress, because it's a cascade of stress equals more stress equals
more stress. So this is why it's very important to learn to turn off
the stress response. You don't want it elevated for too long. So
there's one study that Dallman and her colleagues did where they
stimulate chronic stress by increasing corticosteroids, cortisol. And
they found that subjects would increase their consumption of sugar and
fat. In fact they would even eat lard It's sounds disgusting, but they
were willing to just eat more fat and more sugar. And that led to all
sorts of things like type two diabetes that led to dysfunction in the
adrenal output, et cetera. And so the real key is to learn to shut off
the stress response. Because the interesting thing is, is that
dominant colleagues and some studies that followed up on their work
found that if the system was kicked into motion for too long, then
there was a tremendous shift overall towards anxiety, because it turns
out that body fat itself receives neural innervation. Neurons actually
talked to body fats so now you have body fat releasing certain
hormones, you've got the adrenals releasing cortisol, and all of that
is feeding back to the brain to make you want more sugar and fatty
foods. So that's how the so-called comfort foods work. And you should
watch yourself next time you experience stress. If it's a short-term
about of stress, typically it blocks hunger. If it's a longer about of
stress typically it triggers hunger, in particular for these so-called
comfort foods, sugary and fatty foods. And it's kind of interesting
how short-term stress can actually block hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=4440"&gt;Bombesin: Energy Without Eating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does that by activating or interacting with a system called the
bombesin system. Bombesin is a peptide hormone. I think it was named
after some sort of reptiles or amphibians, excuse me, some sort of
toad. I think it was initially sequenced from the toad before it was
later discovered in humans. And I think the Toad's Latin name is
Bombina bombina, or something of that sort. And so they decided to
call this thing bombesin, but it reduces eating and stress liberates
bombesin and makes you want to eat less. But chronic stress causes all
these positive feedback changes, which are not positive. I'm calling
them positive because they amplify the stress response over and over
not because they are good for you. So short-term stress great, long-
term stress really, really bad. Other bad effects of stress that we
can talk about and I won't list off too many more of these, because
you know so many of them, you hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=4500"&gt;How Stress Makes Our Hair Gray, &amp;amp; How To Prevent Stress-Induced-Graying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really want to know how to control them I'm guessing is that yes
indeed stress can make you go gray. The rates at which people go gray,
meaning gray hair, some cases gray body hair as well depend on some
genetic factors. There are a couple of ways that we can go gray.
There's actually a STEM cell, what they call niche in every follicle.
So you have STEM cells in the follicle that can produce more and more
of the given hair cell. And they're actually peroxide groups. You know
we hear about bleaching hair with peroxide, at least in the 80s that
was a thing, but you can use hydrogen peroxide to bleach things, and
you can produce your own peroxide in the hair follicle, that will
cause the hairs to go gray. In addition pigmentation of hair, just
like pigmentation of skin is controlled by melanocytes, our old
friends, the melanocytes. And I say old friends 'cause on previous
episodes I talked about why sunlight and getting ample sunlight can
increase levels of certain things like melanocytes stimulating hormone
which reduce hunger. It can improve testosterone and estrogen levels
and all the reasons for that. Well, it turns out that activation of
the so-called sympathetic nervous system, which is really just another
name for the system that liberates adrenaline from the adrenals and
epinephrine in the brain drives depletion of melanocytes in hair stem
cells. So indeed there's a rate of aging that we will undergo based on
our genetics, but stress will make us go gray. And the paper that you
should look to if you want to read more about this came out very
recently. This is Zang et al, Z H A N G et al. Nature. Fabulous
journal, definitely one of the apex journals, 2020. So this paper
showed that the activation of stress in various forms will deplete
these melanocytes stem cells. You do not have to worry about an ice
bath, or hard exercise or breathing, increasing your levels of stress
to the point where it's going to make you go gray. We're talking again
about chronic stress. And if you want to offset the stress effects on
graying of hair you can do that by either having a practice that helps
you regulate stress on a consistent basis. So something like non sleep
deep breath, or meditation. You can get access to massages or
vacations those are great, but having a practice to keep stress clamps
so that it's not chronically elevated, that will be great as well.
This is another case where sunlight we know stimulates melanocytes,
not just in skin, but in hair. And so getting ample sunlight, having a
practice to regulate stress will offset the stressed induced grain of
hairs by way of stress induced depletion of melanocytes. And if
melanocytes sounds a lot like melanin you're right. That's because
anything involved with pigmentation in the brain and body generally
has "melano" up in the front of the word in some way or another. So if
chronic stress is so bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=4685"&gt;Blunting Chronic Cortisol, Including: Ashwagandha &amp;amp; Science Of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because of its effects on epinephrine and cortisol being elevated for
too long then the question becomes of course, well, what's chronic
stress? How do I know the difference between chronic and acute stress?
And how do I keep chronic stress at bay? Because of all these negative
effects, I didn't even list out the number of other ones, the effects
on depression, which certainly has a correlate with elevated cortisol.
Thyroid hormone. Low thyroid hormone is associated with depression.
Mistimed thyroid, once again getting your light and your feeding and
your exercise and your sleep on a consistent schedule or consistent
ish is going to be the most powerful thing you can do in order to
buffer yourself against negative effects on mental health and physical
health for that matter. There are things that one can take
supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera. Some of you out there may
have or may know people that have Cushing's, which is chronically
elevated cortisol. There are prescription drugs that we will talk
about that can be used. But most people are dealing with a situation
where life gets stressful then less stressful, stressful then less
stressful. I would say, based on the data from McEwen and others, Bob
Sapolsky's Lab over many years. I would say any stress that lasts more
than a day or two days, or three days is starting to become chronic
stress. There's really no strict cutoff because we're not measuring
everybody's cortisol from moment to moment. My lab has done
experiments where we measure stress in people over time. People vary
tremendously in their ability to have a really hard day and then fall
deeply asleep. That's going to be the ultimate reset is the ability to
sleep well more or less undisturbed each night, although one or two
wake ups during the night, probably not going to be too detrimental
provided they're not too long, and you're not viewing light during
those wake-ups or your phone. But the things that you can take, if you
feel like you're chronically stressed and you're veering toward some
of the negative effects of stress are many. There are some simple
things that people can do in terms of supplementation. All supplements
of course have to be checked out for their safety margins for you,
because there going to differ from person to person. You're
responsible for making sure they're safe for you if you decide to use
them. One of the most common ones is Ashwagandha and it has a powerful
anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect. You're welcome to go to examine.com
and for zero cost you can see their so-called human effect matrix.
Ashwagandha has many uses, It's been used to enhance power output in
athletes it has been shown to modestly increase testosterone. It has
been shown to modestly adjust things like low density lipoprotein
cholesterol, the so-called bad cholesterol in quotes. It has a
profound effect on anxiety that's been shown in nine studies. Nine
peer reviewed independent studies, mean funded by organizations that
have no vested interest in the answer. It has a very strong effect on
cortisol itself. How strong? The decrease in cortisol noted in humans
is 14.5 to 27.9% reduction in otherwise healthy but stressed humans.
That's great. Six studies. And it mentions there's a significantly
larger than many other supplements. Now, some people will say that
taking Ashwagandha chronically may not be good. If you've heard about
that, or you can point to specific studies that indicate exactly why
it's not good, please put in the comment section or let me know. In
the comment section on YouTube would be best. The studies that I'm
referring to did explore both genders. The number of subjects was
reasonably high, 64 or more. One to six months study, so these were
long-term studies. That's great, you like to see that not just in an
acute study. So males and females lots of different ages overweight
and non overweight. They did blood draws of cortisol which is going to
end and as well as saliva test. Saliva is actually the best way to
measure free cortisol. You can also measure it from ear wax it turns
out which sounds pretty gross and kind of is. But nonetheless that's
where cortisol will accumulate in earwax and in saliva, the free
cortisol. But that's six very quality studies, independently supported
that all points to these very significant, you know, 14.5 to 27.9%
reductions in otherwise healthy adults. So if you're somebody who is
dealing with chronic stress, it's a stressful period in your life and
you want to stave off the negative effects of stress. Well then
ashwagandha may, I want to highlight, may be right for you. It also
does tend to lower total cortisol which is interesting. It can lower
depression to at somewhat minimal degree, and can lower as I mentioned
before things like low density lipoprotein. I think ashwagandha comes
through is kind of the heavy hitter in department. Now what's
interesting also is the other effects of ashwagandha that are
downstream of reducing chronic stress and cortisol, 'cause cortisol
has so many effects, there're receptors for cortisol all over the body
and brain. And so I'll just list these off quickly, I'm not going to
list off each study or talk about how many subjects in detail. Again,
you can go to examine.com if you want, and just put it in Ashwagandha.
See reactive protein, which is a marker of all sorts of negative
health effects. Cardiovascular health, even macular degeneration is
notably reduced. Heart palpitations notably reduced. serum T3 and T4,
our old friends from the thyroid hormones from a previous episode are
increased. Symptoms of OCD decreased, both the obsessions and the
compulsion's right obsessions are of the mind compulsions are of
behavior. So there are a lot of things that are downstream of reducing
cortisol. Lowered heart rate, lowered rates of insomnia, slightly
improved memory. Why that would be, I don't know, because cortisol in
the short term can increase memory, I'm guessing it's from increased
sleep. Decreased pain, increased quality of you know... Decreased
reaction times, things of that sort. So the list goes on and on, but
all of those things stem downstream of decreased cortisol. So if one
were to decide to take ashwagandha in order to reduce cortisol, given
that you want cortisol early in the day to have energy throughout the
day, the time to take it as probably later in the day or in the
evening. I've never heard of it preventing sleep or causing insomnia
of any kind. That certainly wasn't listed as one of the major effects
on examine.com. I will take ashwagandha from time to time if I'm
chronically stressed, or if I'm not sleeping as well as I ought to.
You might think that with all my knowledge about sleep and sleep
protocols that I would sleep perfectly every night, but unfortunately
I have a dog that has a canine form of of sundowners, of dementia, so
he's up much of the night, these days. And so there's no way I'm
getting a solid night of sleep lately. And so I will supplement with
ashwagandha and typically I'll take it before sleep and maybe also
with my last meal of the day, which is at least two hours before I go
to sleep. Again you have to decide if it's right for you. The dosages
can vary tremendously. I would just go buy what's on the bottle from a
reputable brand. I would also check out examine.com, because it
mentions a range of dosages that people have used. And in various
studies to different effects. Now, there is something out there that
some of you may actually be taking or ingesting that can increase
cortisol and not so incidentally can decrease estrogen and
testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=5150"&gt;Licorice Increases Cortisol &amp;amp; Blood Pressure, &amp;amp; Reduces Testosterone (by Glycyrrhizin)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because remember cortisol is made from the cholesterol molecule so is
estrogen and testosterone. So are estrogen and testosterone, excuse
me, and it's competitive. So you're either making more cortisol, or
you're making more of the sex steroid hormones, estrogen and
testosterone. Believe it or not liquorice, which I always thought of
as a candy, but liquorice contains a substance that I can't pronounce.
G L Y C Y R R H I Z I N. Glycyrrhizin, which is of the glabra species
of plant, actually because of its chemistry, this 18-beta-hydroxy-
cholenoic acid, you don't need to know all that. Liquorice, black
liquorice contains a substance that increases cortisol, and it's
increases not huge, but it is significant. This has been looked at in
females age 18 to 29, males and females age 18 to 29, people age 30.
These are separate studies where I'm listing off the different ages,
ages 30 to 64. It turns out that you can see pretty substantial
increases in serum cortisol and decreases in testosterone and
estrogen. So that was complete news to me. Also increases in blood
pressure that are pretty substantial. That's going to be downstream of
cortisol, increasing cortisol increase blood pressure in order to
engage the stress response as part of the stress response. Increased
hormones of other kinds that are associated with stress. Who knew? I
didn't know maybe you knew, previously if you did forgive me but
licorice and some of the compounds in black licorice can actually
increase stress. Probably not the thing to be ingesting during periods
of chronic stress. Whether or not anyone has had positive effects of
using it to increase cortisol and other contexts, let me know, but
very interesting that the chemistry of licorice increases stress
hormones, and therefore you would probably want to, almost certainly
we want to avoid it in conditions of chronic stress. Also, if you're
trying to optimize testosterone and estrogen liquorice seems like a
bad idea. I suppose one instance where you might want to use licorice
would be if you're traveling and you're trying to wake up at a
particular location, because licorice has these effects on cortisol
and cortisol is associated with the waking phenomenon and alertness
and energy, you could use it in that regard. However, I would be
careful to time it so that you're not getting two cortisol increases
throughout the day, two peaks. So you're going to want to make sure
that you're doing all the other things correct for jet lag and
adjusting to jet lag. And if you want to know what those things are,
including timing your feeding, using temperature, using exercise,
using light to adjust to jet lag more quickly, please see the episode
that we did on jet lag and shift work where I cover all those
protocols in detail. The other compound that I think deserves
attention is apigenin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=5330"&gt;Apigenin: Anti-Cortisol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A P I G E N I N, apigenin. which is what's found in chamomile.
Apigenin I've talked about previously. It has various effects one is
it is a mild anti-estrogen that's been shown in various studies, and
it does have a bit of an anxiolytic effect of reducing anxiety. I take
it before bedtime, 50 milligrams. Again, you have to decide or figure
out if that's safe for you or not. I'm not suggesting you take it. The
major source of action is to calm the nervous system. And it does that
primarily by adjusting things like GABA and chloride channels but it
also has a mild effect in reducing cortisol. So Ashwagandha and
Apigenin together, I would consider the most potent commercial
compounds that are in supplement non-prescription form that one could
use if they were interested in reducing chronic stress, especially
late in the day by way of reducing cortisol late in the day. So you're
probably getting the impression that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=5393"&gt;Protocols For Optimizing Energy &amp;amp; Immune System Function (&amp;amp; Learning)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cortisol and epinephrine are a bit of a double-edged sword. You want
them elevated, but not for too long or too much. You don't want them
up for days and days, and days, but you do want to have a practice in
order to increase them in the short term. So we should talk about
protocols that can set a foundation of cortisol and epinephrine that
is headed towards optimal. Optimization is always going to be a series
of regular practices that you do every day. So sleeping at certain
times, light at specific times, food at specific times. Certain foods,
et cetera, and that's highly individual, but there are some universals
and we've covered a number of those in the discussion today. Meal
timing, meal schedules has a profound effect on energy levels. And as
I mentioned before the energy I'm referring to is not glucose energy.
It's not burning carbs while running or ketones. What I'm talking
about is neural energy, epinephrine and cortisol. Fasting and timing
one's eating are two sides of the same coin. So even if you're on a
kind of standard three meal a day with a couple of snacks in between
diet or nutrition regimen, you are fasting whenever you're asleep, or
you're not ingesting any calories. So unless you're hooked up to an IV
of glucose you are fasting while you're sleeping. There are several
different kinds of fasting that can relate to epinephrine and
cortisol. I will do an entire episode on optimizing food intake for
performance in the sports context. That's coming up but in the
meantime, I'd like to just talk about fasting as a source of
epinephrine. Anytime when our blood glucose is low cortisol and
epinephrine are going to go up. If we fast for too long, that is
stress. There's no way around that. Now that doesn't mean it doesn't
have other beneficial effects. Running a marathon is stress, but it
can also have positive effects if that's your thing. So stress has
been demonized as a term, but we want to think about stress
mechanistically, as epinephrine and cortisol. And then if we do that
we can think about how to regulate its timing. So anytime we haven't
eaten for four to six hours, levels of epinephrine and cortisol are
going to go up pretty substantially. There's an exception to that,
which is if you are used to eating on the clock every two hours or
every hour being half hour late, or being even 10 minutes late on that
schedule will induce stress. Most of that psychological stress, but
also the release of things like ghrelin that are going to make you
hungry, 'cause they're on that eating clock. So one thing that many
people do to great benefit is they follow a so-called circadian eating
schedule. They eat only when the sun is up, they stop when the sun is
down. More or less. The another way to think about this is they stop
eating a couple hours before sleep and they eat more or less upon
waking assuming that they're waking up more or less around the time of
the sunrises, maybe plus or minus two hours. Okay. So sort of typical
schedule. Now, let's say you decide to do what I do, which is I skip
breakfast. I drink water, I delay my caffeine for 90 minutes to two
hours, and then I drink my caffeine. And then my first meal is
typically around lunchtime, 11:30 or 12:00. And yes, occasionally I
throw back some almonds or walnuts or something earlier in the day. I
do do that from time to time if I get hungry enough, or if I just
happen to see them. I'm kind of a drive by eater, if I see blueberries
or nuts or something I'm just going to pick them up and put them in my
mouth. I try not do that off other people's plates, but I just have
that habit of doing that from time to time. But typically I don't eat
until about noon. So I've got a cortisol increase I've got my sunlight
in the morning. So I'm getting a big pulse and energy early in the
day. And yes, there's a little bit of agitation, I am hungry sometimes
early in the day sometimes no, but my ghrelin system is used to
kicking in right around noon. At the point where I eat as long as I
don't eat carbohydrate in my case, I know that my epinephrine levels
are going to stay pretty high. So for me, it's usually meat and salad,
or something of that sort, or fish and salad. although I don't
particularly like eating fish because of the taste, but I'm assuming
low carb or ketones ish throughout the day. So I'm probably in a
slightly elevated state of epinephrine and cortisol throughout the
day. Some of you are fasting even longer. You're pushing out till 4:00
PM or 8:00 PM, or maybe you're even fasting around the clock. Anytime
you're fasting you're increasing epinephrine and cortisol release. You
can do all the meditation in the world to keep your mind calm, but you
are closer to that edge of stress. And you're closer to that edge of
peak stress. So that's something that's just important to understand
the description about comfort foods and cortisol was one of kind of an
extreme case where cortisol systems kick over to a positive feedback
loop. But we all eat to suppress cortisol and epinephrine. When we're
hungry cortisol and epinephrine create an agitation so we go seek
food. When we ingest food typically if it includes carbohydrate,
there's a blunting of cortisol. There's a blunting of epinephrine in
the bloodstream. If you've ever had too much coffee to drink and you
go and have a couple of pieces of bread, you will feel the... You
might describe it as the caffeine getting soaked up out of your
system, but what you're doing is you're elevating blood glucose which
is more or less saturating the effect of caffeine in your system. Not
completely, but it's going to have that effect. If you're very
stressed and you sit down to eat something it will calm you down. Yes.
Because some of the blood that goes to your stomach but more so
because of these effects in blunting cortisol and epinephrine. So the
important point here is that if you want to be alert you can do that
by way of not eating. Of course, please ingest fluids. I know some
people water fast out there. I am yet to see good science on water
fasting and why that can stimulate stem cells, or people love the idea
of after the Nobel prize was given for autophagy and this idea that
our cells clean up debris in senescent cells, yes, that's true. But
the idea that water fasting is going to promote that, I find rather
amusing. Please send me the data if you know of some great study in a
decent journal, but pretty much this is something I hear about. I
don't think water fasting is a good idea, nor should you be drinking
so much water that you kill yourself. You can actually drink enough
water that you die. So I think ingesting water in healthy amounts is a
good thing, stay hydrated. But if you want to be alert stay hydrated,
caffeine may or may not be in your regimen, but fasting will make sure
that your levels of energy are up and you will be primed very well for
doing a protocol of the sort that we talked about earlier in this
episode. Of breathing, or cold exposure, or exercise to get that
increase in the immune system function. And if you do that after
learning after trying to learn something, it will increase learning
for that particular set of information, whether or not it's motor, or
language, or whatever it happens to be. Mathematics, programming. So
fasting is a tool for many reasons, it can increase growth hormone, et
cetera. But today I'm talking about fasting as a tool to bias your
system toward more epinephrine adrenaline release and toward more
cortisol release but still low enough that it's not chronic stress,
that it's not causing negative health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=5820"&gt;When Fasting, Exercise, Cold &amp;amp; Intense Breathing Become Detrimental&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please know that if life is very, very stressful if you're
experiencing lots of stressors and you're chronically fasting, you are
positioning yourself toward a greater likelihood of being chronically
stressed in the ways that are negative. Negative effects on the
reproductive access, lower testosterone and estrogen. Negative effects
on you're hair will turn gray, there's reasons for that, Your sleep
will suffer. Your immune system will suffer. So I think while it's
nuanced our discussion today about epinephrine and cortisol increasing
energy and immunity are designed to help you understand when you
should be doing certain things. When you should throttle back. When
you might want to kick up your adrenaline a bit, if you're suffering
from low energy because you're just kind of feeling down and a little
bit under activated, well then the practices of ice baths and intense
breathing, et cetera, could be very beneficial so might fasting. But
if you're feeling exhausted and burnt out sort of drained and stressed
well then fasting or doing a lot of cold exposure, or doing a lot of
intense exercise is driving you further and further into chronic
stress. So because I don't have a saliva test or a blood test, or God
forbid an earwax test to measure your cortisol as we're engaging in
this discussion together, you have to gauge for yourself whether or
not you are in a state of under activated and need more epinephrine
and cortisol, or whether or not you are over activated, in terms of
cortisol and epinephrine. And you need ways to buffer those
ashwagandha, Maybe it should be a warm mellow bath not an ice bath. So
one has to learn how to regulate these hormones with behavior, with
nutrition, perhaps with supplementation. And then of course there are
prescription drugs, and I always leave these to the end because A, I'm
not a medical doctor I'm not prescribing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=5940"&gt;Prescription Compounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a professor, I'm professing a number of things that you can decide
for yourselves what to do with or not. But of course there are
prescription drugs that can increase cortisol or decrease cortisol in
cases like Cushing's syndrome, which if you have that diagnosed, you
should talk to a physician. You should talk ideally to a
endocrinologist but to a physician of some sort, board certified
physician. There are drugs that can be used to treat injury like
corticosteroids, that you can inject to reduce inflammation injury,
but they are cortisol. So they're going to bias you towards more
stress in other domains. Remember cortisol can cross the blood brain
barrier so you're going to be more prone to psychological stress. I
also want to mention again, that I think there's great benefit to
having a practice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=5987"&gt;Tools For Accessing Alert &amp;amp; Calm States of “Energy”: Separating The Brain &amp;amp; Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that perhaps you do every other day, but if you can't maybe every
third day or every other day of deliberately increasing your
adrenaline in your body while learning to stay calm in the mind, so
that you learn to separate the brain body experience. You know, we
hear so much about how beneficial it is to unify the brain and body,
that we're all out of touch with our brain and bodies. I particularly
dislike claims like that or statements like that because there's great
power as we learned today in having your body activated by some sort
of stimulus, cold water or even psychological stress, but learning to
stay calm in your mind. I should just remind you that most of the
negative effects on your life and on the lives of others are due to
people perhaps you I hope not being unable to regulate their mind when
they have high levels of adrenaline in their body, either 'cause they
read something on a text or a comment section, of course that never
happens to me, but it may happen to you. Of course it happens to me,
but the idea is to stay calm in your mind so that then you can
regulate your action, right? And so I think that there are these
practices that one can develop over time that are really straight
forward and zero costs, right? You could find any number of ways to
increase your adrenaline and stay calm. And we tend to focus on things
like exercise as the way that we get our energy up. But today, again
I'm talking about deliberately increasing adrenaline while staying
calm mentally, because that has great utility when the adrenaline hits
through unwanted events, through things that we didn't seek out. So
the ability to regulate adrenaline cortisol is about inducing them
deliberately when you want to push back on infection, potential
infection from bacteria viruses. It's about pulling back on adrenaline
and cortisol, maybe through the use of supplementation but certainly
through proper use of light and sleep and mental tools that we talked
about as well when they are chronically elevated. It's about training
your system, not just to be unified at brain and body, which sounds
great until you're stressed and then that's terrible. It's really
about having a deliberate dissociation between the adrenaline response
from the adrenals and the adrenaline response from the brainstem. So
once again, we've covered a ton of material. I hope right now, you're
thinking,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&amp;amp;t=6131"&gt;Ways To Apply Knowledge Presented Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, am I in state of chronic stress? Am I under activated? Or could
I afford to increase my levels of adrenaline cortisol to improve my
relationship to my immune system and to energy, neural energy. If you
like the information that you heard today and you want to remember it,
well, then at the end of this episode, perhaps you go do something to
increase your level of adrenaline. And now you know what some of those
things are, because it will help you retain the information, or you
could apply that to anything else that you learn or experience of
course. And I hope that you'll think about some of the ways in which
cortisol and adrenaline are not good or bad, that stresses in good or
bad but short-term stress is healthy. Alertness and energy is healthy
even if it puts you at the edge of agitation, that's an opportunity to
learn how to control these hormones better. And I hope that if you're
in a state of chronic stress that you'll do things to start tamping
down some of that stress and that you realize that your nervous system
and your hormone system are linked, but they're linked in ways that
you can control, that we don't have to be slaves to our hormones. And
certainly not the hormones that cause us stress, we can learn to
control those both to the benefit of our body and benefit of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [guitar music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that
theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first
sponsor is Four Sigmatic. Four Sigmatic is a wellness company that
makes mushroom coffee. And if you're asking yourself, why would you
want to put mushrooms in coffee? First of all, let me tell you these
are not psychedelic mushrooms and no, the coffee doesn't taste like
mushrooms. The coffee is delicious and you don't taste mushrooms at
all. I know this because I've been using Four Sigmatic coffee and been
stocking it in my laboratory for several years now long before I ever
had the podcast or Four Sigmatic was a sponsor. The two kinds of
mushrooms that are in Four Sigmatic coffee our lion's mane and chaga
mushrooms, both of which have been shown to have a slight anxiolytic
effect to reduce anxiety. And lion's mane has also been shown in
several studies to lower the symptoms of depression just slightly.
Although I wouldn't consider it a treatment for depression, that's an
attractive benefit, as well as have some effect at offsetting
cognitive decline. Albeit slightly, the effects were real in the
studies that I've found. So if you'd like to try Four Sigmatic, you
can go to foursigmatic.com/huberman. That's F-O-U-R-S-I-G M-A-T-I-C

episode is also brought to us by Blinkist. Blinkist is an app that has
thousands of nonfiction books condensed down to just 15 minutes of key
takeaways that you can read or listen to. I'm a big reader and I'm a
big consumer of nonfiction. And most of the time I consume books in
their traditional form like a book where you flip the pages and so
forth. I also listen to full length audio books. However, over time we
know that we forget lots of things. And even though sometimes I think
I got all the critical information from a book, when I listen to
Blinkist and I get the 15-minute rundown, either an audio or in
written form, what I find is there key points that oftentimes I
missed. And so it's a great way for me to both jog my memory and to
bring forward ideas that I hadn't considered previously. They have
thousands of nonfiction titles and some really terrific ones in the
science category. For example, David Eagleman's book "Livewired" which
came out recently as a book I read in full length form and I've
listened to the Blinkist version of it as well. "Livewired" is a book
about neuroplasticity. The brain's ability to change in response to
experience. I get so many questions and requests for books about
neuroplasticity. In my opinion, "Livewired" is the most recent and up-
to-date and the best one to date. So that's there. David Sinclair's
book "Lifespan." David, as many of you know, is a professor of
genetics at Harvard Medical School. "Lifespan" is this terrific book
about aging as a disease and the future and present of longevity
treatments. Very interesting book. As well as Matt Walker's book, "Why
We Sleep." Matt, of course, is a professor at UC Berkeley and "Why We
Sleep" is a terrific book about why we sleep, the science of sleeping,
and things you can do to improve your sleep. All of those are on
Blinkist. But with Blinkist you get unlimited access to their massive
library of nonfiction. If you'd like to try Blinkist, right now they
have a special offer just for our audience, just for Huberman Lab

episode is also brought to us by Munk Pack. Munk Pack is a company
that makes keto-friendly snacks that taste incredible but have just
one gram of sugar or less. As I've said before on this podcast, I am
not in ketosis. I'm not ketogenic. I don't advocate or follow any one
particular diet. For me, what works is to fast in the early part of
the day and to eat low carb and keto-ish throughout the day. That's
for alertness and attention. So I can work and focus and I don't feel
sluggish or brain fog. And then at night and in the evening is when I
tend to eat my carbohydrates to aid the transition to sleep. That's
what works for me. Munk Pack bars are a terrific snack whether or not
you're keto all the time, whether or not you're low carb, or even if
you're not, they are absolutely delicious. And I don't say that
lightly. I'm not a big fan of bars in general. Most bars to me tastes
like a combination of, you know, a metal bumper mixed with some
cardboard and some lawn trimmings and some artificial sugar. Munk Pack
bars, when they were sent to me, I was like, all right, I'll try them.
I tried it. Like, uh-oh, this is a problem 'cause I liked them very,
very much. And when I say it's a problem, it really is a problem. I
actually keep the Munk Pack boxes in my basement so that I don't tear
through them all at once. I'm a huge fan of the caramel sea salt
flavor. It's delicious. Just talking about it makes me hungry for one.
But they also have sea salt, dark chocolate, peanut butter dark
chocolate. They're terrific. In addition to being keto-friendly,
they're also gluten-free, plant-based, non-GMO, no soy, trans fat,
sugar alcohols or artificial colors. So all the bad stuff that you
don't want. And as I mentioned before, they're keto, less than one
gram of sugar. If you want to try Munk Pack, you can go to

been talking all about hormones,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=365"&gt;Thyroid &amp;amp; Growth Hormone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which are these absolutely incredible chemicals in our brain and body.
They impact our entire lifespan. So from the time that we are in the
womb, they're controlling the development of our brain and our bodies.
After we are born, they're still controlling the development of our
brain and bodies. And I did say development, and that's because,
contrary to what most people think, development lasts the entire
lifespan. From the time you're conceived until the time you die, you
are developing, you are changing. And hormones are constantly updating
and changing the different functions of your body. They have two major
kinds of effects. One are immediate effects, so they can actually bind
to or kind of park in parking spots on cells and impact all sorts of
things like the growth of cells, et cetera. They also can control gene
expression. This is the way that hormones during puberty control body
hair growth and breast development and growth of muscles and limbs and
height and all sorts of things. They are incredible. We've talked
about testosterone and estrogen. We talked about insulin and glucagon
and some of the other things. Today, we are going to talk about
metabolism. Mainly going to talk about thyroid hormone and growth
hormone and some other related pathways. I'm going to explain to you
the logic of how thyroid hormone and growth hormone work. It will
become obvious why I've paired thyroid and growth hormone together in
the same episode. And I will of course talk about tools that you can
use to elevate or reduce thyroid hormone. There are cases where people
want to reduce thyroid hormone. I will talk about tools that you can
use to elevate growth hormone. There are rare cases where people want
to reduce growth hormone. Most people are interested in increasing
growth hormone. So today is going to be rich with information, rich
with actionable tools. And as always, the idea is to spell out an
organizational logic so you can come away from this episode and in
fact the entire month on hormones, really understanding at some level
what these things we call hormones are and how they work. And that's
really to arm you to encounter information going forward, whether or
not it comes from me or from somebody else, a book or a course,
someplace else online to make sense of how to work with these
incredible chemicals we call hormones. Before we begin to talk about
thyroid and growth hormone and how our metabolism works and how to
control metabolism, I want to answer a few questions that I received
from you from the audience. Every once in a while, someone will send
me a quite earnest question about something they saw on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=524"&gt;Food Shapes: Do They Matter?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of the things I've heard about quite a bit in the last couple
of weeks as we've been talking about hormones and food intake and how
those interact is this question of are certain foods particularly good
for certain organs of the body? And can that be predicted on the basis
of the shape of those foods? So first of all, I want to acknowledge
the question as a valid one, because I see this every once in a while
out there. People will say, well, you know, walnuts are in the shape
of the brain and therefore they are good for your brain or, you know,
a particular fruit like the beet often looks like a heart and it's
good for your heart. And I certainly invite questions of all kinds,
provided they're sincere questions. However, I am not aware of any
science whatsoever supporting the idea that the shape of a given food
or object for that matter is relevant to its functional role in the
body in reference to biology. Now, beets contain something that we're
going to talk about today. They contain a substance called arginine,
which actually can control the dilation of blood vessels and arteries.
So it has some relationship to heart and heart health. Walnuts contain
various fatty acids that maybe, I want to underscore maybe, beneficial
for certain aspects of brain health but there's no evidence whatsoever
that the shape of the food itself is relevant. And, you know, I think
what's happened is, is that people have gone out there and found foods
that contain certain substances like carrots and vitamin A or walnuts
and particular fatty acids or beets and arginine. And they've selected
the foods that happen to be in the shape of the thing, the organ that
the particular substance like vitamin A or fatty acids and so forth
might benefit or support. But of course, there are many, many other
sources of these nutrients that don't come from walnuts or from beets
or from carrots. And so I guess the short way to put it is that the
idea that the shape of some food is an indication of whether or not
that food would be healthy for a particular organ in the body is
absolutely unfounded. I don't know of any evidence for it and I'm not
out to quash anybody's great love of these foods. I enjoy all the
foods I just described, but the shape of things in the physical
universe bears very little, if any, relevance to the nutrients that it
contains and therefore the organs that it supports. So thank you for
your question but if you see that out there, I don't even think you
need to tell the person who's putting that information out into the
world. I would just, you know, back away slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=703"&gt;Stevia: Naming &amp;amp; Impact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing, before we move into today's material, last episode, I
talked about the problems with emulsifiers in highly processed foods
and the way that they can strip the mucosal lining of the gut. And
they can limit the signaling of hormones like CCK that can signal to
the brain satiety, the signal to stop eating. And then we got into a
discussion about artificial sweeteners and I threw out Stevia as an
artificial sweetener. And several people reached out to correct me
that Stevia is not an artificial sweetener, it is a noncaloric
sweetener, and you are correct. I lumped artificial and noncaloric
sweeteners together. And thanks to many of you that also sent me some
references. It does not appear that Stevia can negatively impact the
gut microbiome. It does seem unique among noncaloric sweeteners. There
are probably others out there. The other thing that we discussed is
how Stevia can lead to slight increases in blood glucose but can also
improve insulin management just slightly, probably cancels to zero in
terms of its impact on blood glucose, provided it's not at
concentrations that are super, super sweet. Ingestion of anything
that's very sweet, whether or not contains calories or not, artificial
or not, will create an insulin response. In fact, just walking past a
bakery and smelling delicious baked goods can increase your insulin
secretion. And so we just want to point that out. Thank you for the
information and the references that you found. Please send additional
ones if you do find them. And I appreciate that you allow me to make
corrections every once in a while I must speak here and the
opportunity to make corrections keeps us all on the same page. And
please do keep any feedback that you have about particular things I
cover here coming my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=810"&gt;Metabolism 101: Your Brain the Furnace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much interest in metabolism. We hear about having a high
or a low metabolism. There are some people out there who would like to
reduce their metabolism. They simply can't eat enough to maintain
their weight. Most people, however, struggle with the opposite issue.
They struggle to maintain a healthy weight and/or their metabolism is
too low. Now, there are a variety of reasons why metabolism can be
low. Today, we are going to talk about two hormones, thyroid hormone
and its related pathways and growth hormone and it's related pathways,
which arguably are the two hormones and two systems in the body that
are most significant for setting your overall level of metabolism.
Before we dive into those, I just want to cover a little bit of what
metabolism is. And I want to talk about which organs in your body use
the most energy. So metabolism is the consumption of energy, not
necessarily eating, but it's the use of energy in the cells of the
body for growth of tissues, for repair of tissues, and also just for
day-to-day maintenance of function. A good example of maintenance of
function would be your brain. Most of your metabolic needs, your so-
called basal or resting metabolic needs are for your brain, for
thinking. If you were to just sit in a bed all day and do nothing but
think, that consumes about 75% of your metabolic needs. Now, there's
also moving around. If you have a job that requires a lot of heavy
labor or lifting things or you're a new parent and you're carrying
kids around and you're going up and down the stairs or back and forth
to the refrigerator for formula, et cetera, well then you're burning
more energy, burning more calories. But even if you are very
physically active, unless you're an ultra marathoner or a marathoner,
chances are that 75% of your metabolic needs are coming just from your
brain. And that's because neurons consume a lot of energy. Neurons, of
course, are just the nerve cells of your brain. So these two hormones,
thyroid hormone and growth hormone, we think of as related to
metabolism of things in the body, keeping body fat low, and keeping
muscles strong, and tendons strong and repairing themselves, et
cetera, but they are also key for brain function, for the ability to
maintain cognitive function throughout the lifespan. So the big theme
I'd like to introduce is that metabolism isn't just about losing
weight but having a high metabolism, provided it's not too high, is
great. It means that you will have more lean tissue, more bone and
muscle and less adipose tissue, fat. And we know that that's healthy.
How much fat and how much muscle? Well, that varies, and the numbers
on this are always shifting. But in general, muscle and its related
tissues burns more energy than does adipose tissue or fat. And the
water in your body doesn't consume any energy. So metabolism can be
increased simply by adding muscle to your body and reducing fat or
adjusting the ratio of the two. But regardless, even if you're not
interested in changing body composition, these two hormones, thyroid
hormone and growth hormone, are super important for metabolism of all
kinds, including tissue repair after injury, including maintaining
cognitive function and well-being and the ability to think clearly as
you age, offsetting dementia and so forth. So the big theme here
really includes the previous episodes. You don't have to have seen
those episodes but for the last three episodes and today as well,
we've been talking about hormones, these substances that are released
from one location in the body that go and act other locations in the
body. I'm going to tell you how that works for thyroid and growth
hormone. But now that you've heard about testosterone and estrogen and
you're going to hear about thyroid and growth hormone, I want you to
realize that there's a repeating logic. First of all, there are
neurons in your brain in an area called the hypothalamus, which just
means it's below the thalamus, hypo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=1053"&gt;Releasing Hormones From Your Brain, Stimulating Hormones from Your Pituitary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sits at the base of your brain, in the front, it's part of the
forebrain. So it's more or less above the roof of your mouth, maybe
about a centimeter or so, and then about a centimeter forward in most
people. And neurons in the hypothalamus release hormones that are
called releasing hormones. So we've talked in previous episodes about,
for instance, gonadotropin-releasing hormone. So those are a little
neurons that then signal another brain area called the pituitary to
release other hormones. Today, we're going to see this again. In the
brain, you have neurons that release thyrotropin or thyroid-releasing
hormone. You also have growth hormone-releasing hormone. So anytime
you hear releasing, chances are those are neurons that are in your
brain and they extend little wires we call axons into your pituitary
and the pituitary releases a bunch of hormones into the bloodstream.
And the pituitary releases things that most often have the name of
stimulating hormone because they stimulate organs. So in keeping with
the theme of thyroid hormone, you have thyroid-releasing hormone in
the brain, tells the pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone
and then the thyroid, which we'll talk about in a moment, releases
thyroid hormones. In the testosterone and estrogen episode, we talked
about how you have gonadotropin-releasing hormone, there's the
releasing again, up in the brain. Remember, releasing hormone comes
from the brain. Then you had things like luteinizing hormone and
follicle-stimulating hormone, which were in the pituitary and those
traveled to the ovaries or the testes and acted on those tissues,
okay? So please try and embed this logic. If you hear the word
releasing hormone, it's coming from the brain, and that makes it
actionable in certain ways that we'll return to later. In addition,
the pituitary is letting go of all these hormones into the bloodstream
that are stimulating different tissues. So for thyroid, it's thyroid-
stimulating hormone. And then it goes to the thyroid. And the thyroid
is a little butterfly-shaped gland that's right around the Adam's
apple. If you want to see yours, not directly 'cause it's got skin
over it, what you would do is you'd take a sip of water, you'd look in
the mirror and you'd swallow. And the thing that moves up and down,
that is your thyroid. Now, some people call it your Adam's apple
because it sits right near this protrusion in the trachea, which is
the Adam's apple. No matter, whether or not you're male, female, or
regardless of what your chromosomal background is, everyone has an
Adam's apple. It tends to be more pronounced in people that got a
surge of testosterone early in development because it has a
testosterone sensitivity to it. And that actually controls the timbre,
the so-called deepness of the voice. So the thyroid gland sits right
there and it's got four little bumps behind it called the parathyroid
gland. And it releases two hormones into the blood to stimulate
different tissues and their metabolism. And those hormones are called
T4 and T3. So if this is already sounding like a lot of information,
it's really easy, I promise. Releasing hormone comes from the brain.
Stimulating hormone comes from the pituitary. And in this case, we're
talking about the thyroid, binding up that stimulating hormone and
saying, oh, I need to release something. And it releases T4 and T3.
And guess what? You can basically forget about T4. T4, it's not
completely inactive, it has some roles, but T3 is the one that's more
or less active. Now, what does thyroid hormone do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=1264"&gt;Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair and Energy Consumption of Tissues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think, oh, thyroid, it's like metabolism and people
who are hyperthyroidal have bulging eyes and are real thin and people
who have hypothyroid are overweight and their eyes are like are, you
know, half closed or something. And indeed thyroid hormone controls a
lot of the features of the face and the eyes. And it can control
amounts of adipose tissue and so forth. But the main role of thyroid
hormone, of T3, is to promote metabolism. And that doesn't just mean
the consumption of energy, it means the utilization of energy,
including the buildup of tissues. So it acts on all sorts of target
tissues in the body. It acts on muscle, it acts on the liver, it acts
on the cartilage, it acts on the bone. And it's not just involved in
using energy, it's also converting energy. I do realize I said that
twice. It's involved in taking fats and breaking them down into fatty
acids and converting those into ATP, which is an important thing for
cells to use energy. It's also involved in taking sugars and turning
those into energy. And yes, it goes to adipose tissue to fat. We have
different kinds of fat that we'll talk about today but it goes to
white fat and it liberates or helps liberate some of the fats from
those fat cells and use them for energy. And this is why higher
thyroid is associated with leaner bodies. Lower thyroid is associated
with less lean bodies. So one thing that's absolutely key and is
actionable, we're right there already in discussing tools is iodine.
Iodine comes from things in the ocean, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=1365"&gt;Iodine, L-Tyrosine &amp;amp; Selenium: The Trio Essential For Thyroid Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are a couple of interesting facts about iodine. And then
we'll talk about whether or not you should be supplementing iodine or
not. First of all, iodine is most common in sea salt, in kelp and in
seaweed. And most people can get enough iodine from the food they eat
and/or the table salt they consume. Almost all table salt from all
over the world, regardless of where you are, contains iodine. The
thyroid needs iodine in order to produce thyroid hormone. And you need
sufficient levels of thyroid hormone, not too much, but you need it.
So chances are you are getting enough iodine. Although, you might not,
especially those of you following a particularly, quote, unquote,
clean diet, might not be getting enough iodine. Here's the deal with
iodine. Iodine combines with an amino acid that we've talked about
before called L-tyrosine. L-tyrosine comes from meat, from nuts. There
are some plant-based sources as well. It is the precursor to dopamine.
But in the thyroid, iodine combines or works with L-tyrosine to
produce T3 and T4, the thyroid hormone. So you absolutely need
sufficient iodine, you need sufficient L-tyrosine, and then you also
need something else, which is called selenium. And we'll talk about
selenium in a moment. So there's a condition that shows up in little
pockets in the world. It's not super common, meaning it's not very
widespread, but in certain areas that are far away from the ocean, at
one point, this was historically in the Midwestern states of the
United States, in some mountain regions of other countries, in some
areas of Africa that were far from the ocean, people would get
extremely swollen bulges in their necks. And this was called goiter.
And the reason they were getting those swollen bulges is because the
thyroid itself was hypertrophying. It was growing in an attempt to
churn out more thyroid. And because it was getting a lot of
stimulating hormone from the pituitary. And I don't want to go too far
off track here but as you recall, the brain and the pituitary are
paying attention in a cellular sense to the levels of hormones in the
blood. And when those hormones get too high, they shut off the
stimulating hormone, they shut down the signal to make more, kind of
like a thermostat. When the levels are too low, like there's not
enough testosterone in the bloodstream or there's not enough estrogen,
the brain will continue to push out the signal to make more.
Similarly, if there's not enough thyroid circulating or there's not
enough iodine to make thyroid, therefore not enough thyroid hormone
circulating, the thyroid gland itself is not getting shut down.
There's tons of stimulating hormone and releasing hormone coming from
the brain, like release, release, release, and there's no way they can
make thyroid hormone and so the gland just gets bigger and bigger and
bigger. And so people get goiter. This is one of the reasons why table
salt has iodine in it. Although there are other foods that have iodine
in it as well. So how much iodine do you need? Well, you don't need a
whole lot. Some people who are hypothyroidal might,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=1565"&gt;How Much Iodine Do We Need? By Food, Supplement or Ocean Air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I want to emphasize might, you absolutely should talk to your
doctor. This is a serious matter. Anytime you're talking about
hormones or manipulating levels of thyroid, you absolutely want to
talk to your doctor. Some people benefit from supplementing iodine. It
is contained in most salts. It's in Himalayan salt, not always, but
often. I know these days, there's a lot of excitement about pink salts
and sea salts and what, you know, they're kind of artisan salt thing
has kind of taken off in the foodie land, which is great. Some of them
are actually quite tasty. You can just take it directly if you like
the taste of salt. But iodine can be supplemented through things like
kelp and seaweed and kelp tablets. Now, if you are hyperthyroidal, you
make too much thyroid, that actually can be a problem. So really, the
best way to figure this out is to get your blood levels tested of
thyroid hormone. But there's so much iodine in the ocean that believe
it or not people that live near the coast can actually just absorb it
through the air, just by breathing ocean air. So that gives you a
sense of just how little iodine you actually need to consume in food
or in salt. So if you're within a few miles of the ocean or you visit
the ocean from time to time, you're probably getting plenty. It does
have to come together, as I mentioned, with L-tyrosine, and this is
why foods that contain L-tyrosine, and provided that you have
sufficient iodine in your diet, and if you have sufficient selenium in
your diet, does serve to increase your metabolism. And that again is
for the growth and repair of tissues. And that's really important.
It's not just about keeping your metabolism high so that you can be on
the leaner side of things or adjust your body weight, excuse me, your
body composition ratios the way you like. Repair of injuries, repair
of brain tissue, clearance of any damage from neurons, clearance of
any damage to the body is also going to depend on thyroid. Again,
metabolism being this kind of rate of fuel consumption and use in the
body, generally, not just about body mass indexes and things of that
sort. So let's talk about selenium because it's really important. And
even though most people are getting a lot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=1689"&gt;Selenium For Thyroid: Brazil Nuts &amp;amp; Other Valuable Sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of sufficient iodine, and most people are probably getting enough
L-tyrosine. I'm guessing most people may not be getting enough
selenium if their goal is to increase thyroid hormone, at least that's
what the literature says. Without going into the biochemistry,
selenium is important in order for thyroid hormone to be made because
of the way that it allows L-tyrosine and iodine to interact. And the
thing is most people aren't getting enough selenium because they don't
eat foods that are high in selenium. Now, how much selenium you need
will depend on where you live. It actually varies country by country.
Some countries I found say that you should get 100 micrograms, some
say 200, some say 155. The average was about 155 micrograms, the
countries I looked at. People who are trying to increase thyroid
levels might want to consume more selenium. And if you consume a
vitamin, of course, you want to make sure if it has selenium that
you're not overdoing it by consuming a lot of selenium rich foods
either. But nonetheless, I think it's fair to say that most people
probably could do well by ingesting slightly more selenium than they
currently are. Although, of course, always talk to your doctor. Brazil
nuts are the heavyweight champion of foods to get selenium from. It
has very high concentrations of selenium. In just six or eight Brazil
nuts contain something like 550 micrograms of selenium. It's also
present in fish. So certain fish like yellowfin tuna, although
nowadays whenever I mention tuna or shellfish, which is the other rich
source of selenium, people will tell me immediately there are all
sorts of issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et cetera. So I've
never particularly liked eating fish 'cause of the way it tastes. So
that's why I avoid it. But for those of you that like it, I'm sure
you're much more skilled in knowing which fish to buy and which fish
not to buy. Ham, of all things, contains a lot of selenium, for
whatever reason pork does. I'm not a big consumer of pork. Beef has
some selenium, but what's interesting if you look at the sources, you
know, pork, beef, turkey, chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice,
what you want to understand is that Brazil nuts, six to eight Brazil
nuts has 550 micrograms of selenium. And all the other foods I
mentioned at much greater portion size than equivalent to six to eight
Brazil nuts, either by volume or by calories, they have something like
30 to 50 micrograms of selenium. So if you're not eating Brazil nuts,
I'm guessing most people aren't, and you're not eating a lot of animal
based foods, which I know many of you aren't, then you're probably not
getting enough selenium. And again, you can have these levels measured
or you can just check what you're consuming and figure out whether or
not you're meeting the ration that you need in order to get healthy
levels of thyroid. It is present in things like mushrooms, but again,
in a bowl of mushrooms, you know, what is the equivalent to a bowl of
mushroom is 12 micrograms of selenium. And if the daily ration is
something in 100 to 200 range, again, look it up for the area you are.
You can see really quickly why even though things like mushrooms and
spinach and milk and yogurt and lentils and cashews, and now we're
into the vegetarian segment of the list that I constructed, you're
probably not getting enough selenium. So it's kind of an interesting
thing. If you're an experimenter and you get the clearance from your
doctor, you could try increasing your selenium levels and see how that
impacts your metabolism. Again, Brazil nuts are probably going to be
the most direct way to get sufficient selenium levels but because
levels are so high in Brazil nuts, it also means that you could overdo
it as well. I'm not really aware of what the consequences are of
getting too much selenium, although you can get too much of anything
and I'm guessing those consequences aren't good. I also want to
mention that for children, their daily requirements of selenium are
much lower, as low as 30 or 40 micrograms for kids 14 years or
younger. And in some areas, I really want to underscore this, the
amount of selenium that's recommended daily is as low as 55
micrograms. So it's not that you should be shooting for thousands or
even high levels of hundreds of micrograms of selenium. And again,
that's micrograms, not milligrams. So again, look into what you need
but if you're somebody who's interested in keeping thyroid function
healthy and productive, then you certainly want to make sure you're
getting enough iodine, you're getting enough selenium and you're
getting enough L-tyrosine. And it's interesting when you start looking
at the various foods, especially highly processed foods, then you
start to realize that perhaps many people, maybe you, are not. Not
incidentally, selenium has some other effects on health that can be
quite positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=1985"&gt;Selenium For Pregnancy, Prostate Cancer Risk, Acne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even though these don't relate to thyroid or growth hormone
function specifically, I think you might want to know about them,
given that we're on the topic of selenium. The first is that there are
three studies, all of which showed very high efficacy for reducing the
risk of something called preeclampsia, excuse me, preeclampsia.
Preeclampsia is seizures that are related to blood pressure issues
during or around the delivery of a new baby. And actually, it's a
rare-ish condition but it actually can be quite deadly. And so the
fact that selenium is important for offsetting preeclampsia risk is
interesting. I don't know the exact mechanism and I'm guessing there
are only a few of you out there that are either pregnant or thinking
of conceiving soon, but that's worth noting. Obviously, anything
related to pregnancy or lactation, especially talk to your doctor. I'm
guessing that selenium is probably in a lot of prenatal formulas but
that's one clear benefit of having sufficient selenium. The other is a
reduced prostate cancer risk. There's a study showing that having
sufficient selenium can reduce prostate cancer risk. And there is some
evidence that if you consume foods from areas with soil that's low in
selenium, that can be a problem. And last episode, we talked about all
these issues related to soil quality, things that are making their way
into food that are disrupting hormones and so forth. But having
sufficient selenium from food could offset the low content in any
soil. And so that apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk. It's a
minor effect but it's a statistically significant one. And the other
one is a reduction in acne, which is interesting. I'm guessing that
that probably has to do with the thyroid hormone pathway because of
the way thyroid hormone can impact the liver. And it turns out that
the liver and various biochemical reactions in the liver can impact
acne. And that's probably an episode all into itself but those are
just some additional benefits of getting a sufficient selenium. Okay,
so we're already deep into tools related to making sure that you have
sufficient selenium,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=2120"&gt;“Clean Eating” Downsides: Cruciferous Vegetables, Leeching Iodine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iodine, and L-tyrosine in order to make enough thyroid hormones that
can support your metabolic processes in your liver, your muscles, your
tendons, for whatever purpose, keeping your metabolism high, for body
composition reasons or for healing, for keeping your brain working
well. Earlier I mentioned, there are people who are following very
clean diets. So these are people that consume no processed foods. You
know, any starch they might eat is going to be maybe a rice or a grain
or any protein they might consume is going to be either from, let's
hope, from humanely raised animal sources or maybe they're pure plant-
based. Believe it or not, those folks are actually very susceptible to
low iodine because it turns out that diets that are very meat rich and
don't have many vegetables, as well as diets that are very vegetable
rich but don't have many meats or salts are at risk of lowering
thyroid hormone by way of the iodine pathway and other pathways. And
so let me try and simplify this for you. Chances are if people are
doing the all-meat diet, they're not sprinkling, they're not wrapping
those steaks in seaweed and they may or may not be supplementing with
iodine. Chances are they're probably consuming iodine salt but their
requirements go up if they're not consuming vegetables. People who are
consuming vegetables is kind of interesting. We always hear that we
should have our cruciferous vegetables and those are so important but
there are actually substances, compounds within high quality
cruciferous vegetables that can interfere with thyroid hormone
function. So if you're eating a lot of that stuff, a lot of cabbages
and just look up your other, I think broccoli is a cruciferous
vegetable, and I won't read off the whole list, you could just put
into the internet. But we're always told to eat a lot of the dark,
leafy green stuff. Well, unless that dark, leafy green stuff is kelp
or seaweed, chances are that we're not getting enough iodine unless
we're adding salt to our food. And chances are that we may be lowering
the total amount of thyroid that we're making, as well as the fact
that in plant-rich diets, it's hard to get enough L-tyrosine and I
don't want, you know, I'm not here to inflame any of the vegans or the
carnivore folks. I don't take a stance either way on any of that. I'm
just learning, trying to report the science. The point I want to make
is your health is important. So if you are purely plant-based and
you're eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables, make sure you're
getting enough iodine. It does seem like the cruciferous vegetables
can increase the need for further iodine. And same thing if you're
purely on this all-meat diet or your keto, and you're not ingesting
many vegetables. So I always thought that the cleaner the diet, the
better, but it turns and probably that's true from the standpoint of,
you know, hormone regulation, you know, estrogen and testosterone and
other hormones. The highly processed foods really are terrible.
There's so much evidence for that. The phthalates in plastics and the
processed foods and the emulsifiers, all this stuff we talked about
previous episode, but it does seem to be that people that are not
getting enough iodine for whatever reason, really need to check out
whether or not their iodine levels need to be increased because of the
fact that they're consuming so many plants or so many meats and in
some cases, plants that actually lower thyroid hormone. And not to
beat a dead horse or cabbage, but there are a number of things that
iodine can do that are positive that are sort of,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=2340"&gt;Other Benefits of Iodine: Reducing Inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they're related to thyroid, not directly, they're kind of offshoots of
the thyroid pathway on their downstream of it, we would say, in terms
of how they impact metabolic function. One of those is to reduce
something called c-reactive protein. Some of you may have heard of CRP
or c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein is something that you want
to keep at modestly low levels. It's associated with inflammation and
various forms of heart disease and even eye disease, macular
degeneration. So it does appear that iodine supplementation or getting
sufficient iodine from food, either works, is associated with reduced
levels of c-reactive protein in the blood and an anti-inflammatory
effect. And the anti-inflammatory effect brings us back to our old
friend, interleukin 6. Remember, they're these inflammatory cytokines.
They have many, many names because there are many, many of them.
Interleukin 10 is the one that's anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6 is
the one that's inflammatory. Anytime you see IL-6, that usually means
that there's an inflammatory response, there's a wound, there's
inflammation of the brain, somebody is either sleep deprived or had a
brain injury or they're dealing with some sort of infection. IL-6 is
kind of a catch-all for inflammation. And it does appear that iodine
supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated with
inflammation. So in that sense, iodine can have an anti-inflammatory
effect. So by now, it should be abundantly clear. If you care about
thyroid hormone, if you care about the pathways that it impacts like
having a high level of metabolism, which I guess if for no other
reason is attractive 'cause then you can eat more and still maintain a
healthy body composition, but also for brain health, cognitive
function, tissue repair, all that stuff, keeping c-reactive protein
low, keeping IL-6 low, make sure you're getting enough iodine,
selenium and L-tyrosine. If you're curious how thyroid actually
increases the metabolism, allows you to eat more, et cetera. It
relates to something we covered last issue, which is glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=2460"&gt;Why &amp;amp; How Increased Thyroid Increases Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when you eat something, blood sugar goes up, insulin is
secreted from the pancreas and it makes sure that blood glucose
doesn't go too high, which can damage tissues or too low, which can
make you hypoglycemic. Thyroid increases glucose uptake by various
tissues, in particular muscle and bone. It actually can increase bone
mineral density, which is a really good thing. As you get older,
injuries, when I say older, I mean basically 30 and older, the reason
you can recover more quickly from injuries if you have a healthy
thyroid and healthy thyroid pathways is because you can consume
energy. That energy is diverted toward bone repair and muscle repair
and cartilage repair. And so the way it does this again is by
increasing ATP. But the whole idea here is that iodine, selenium,
L-tyrosine, allow thyroid to be at healthy levels so that thyroid then
can take glucose in the blood and divert it to tissues for it to be
used, in particular your brain. And that's why these things that we're
talking about, supplementing or getting from food, can actually
improve or support brain function. People are always asking me, what
is the food that I should eat for my brain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=2532"&gt;What To Eat To Support Your Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, are blueberries good for your brain? Or they do ask me, are
walnuts good for your brain 'cause it looks like a brain? We talked
about that earlier. The fact of the matter is what you need are
nutrients that support hormones and biological pathways that support
the brain. That's the way to think about it. And I realized when
people ask, what should I eat to support my brain? That's basically
what they're asking in short form. So keeping your thyroid hormone
healthy at healthy levels that is, is going to be terrific for your
brain because 75% of your metabolism is from your brain. The ability
of your brain to use glucose or ketones for that matter is going to be
aided by having healthy thyroid. So do the things, take the things,
eat the things that are going to allow you to have healthy levels of
thyroid hormone. I'm sure a number of you are out there wondering, do
I have healthy levels of thyroid hormone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=2580"&gt;Hyperthyroidism (Too Much) &amp;amp; Hypothyroidism (Too Little)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those can be measured from the blood. There are some telltale signs of
having really high thyroid or really low thyroid, and I could start
listing those off. They're easy to find online as well. Things like
bulging eyes, inability to maintain weight, shaky, anxiety, that's
kind of hyperthyroidal, thinning of hair, this kind of thing. I don't
want to get into diagnosing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. It's
just impossible 'cause you're there and I'm here and we're kind of
shouting back and forth through a tunnel of video and comments. If
you're concerned about having excessively high or excessively low
levels of thyroid hormone, absolutely look up what the symptoms are.
Talk to your physician. And there are a number of good treatments. I
didn't talk about prescription drugs that can improve symptoms related
to hypo or hyperthyroid. Of course, they have synthesized thyroid. So
if you don't make enough thyroid, you can take thyroid, it's by
prescription. If you have too much thyroid, sometimes they'll take out
the thyroid gland or they can administer drugs that will either block
receptors or will interfere with some of the pathways from the brain
to the pituitary or from the pituitary to the thyroid in order to
adjust the thyroid hormone that way. So there are the big guns in
terms of the treatments for different thyroid disorders but we're not
talking about thyroid disorders, we're talking about how to get and
maintain thyroid levels in healthy ranges and some straightforward
ways to do that through diet and supplementation. There's also a lot
of evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=2675"&gt;Menstruation: Thyroid Carbohydrate &amp;amp; Sugar Craving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that for people who menstruate, levels of thyroid hormone can
fluctuate dramatically across the menstrual cycle. So that's really
going to be a process of experimentation. I don't know that you could,
you could, in theory, take blood at different phases of your cycle and
figure out whether or not your thyroid hormone was excessively high or
low at different phases of the cycle. That's going to be pretty tough
to do. If you have an endocrinologist that's willing to do that with
you, terrific. I think most people are going to have to figure out how
supplementing the sorts of things that we talked about before, or
getting them from foods relates to different aspects of their cycle.
In general, the first half of the cycle before ovulation, people crave
carbohydrates and sweets more and that makes total sense based on the
biology of the menstrual cycle. Thyroid hormone is going to go up as
you, as anyone, male or female, menstruating or not, increases more
starchy carbohydrates. This is interesting because ketogenic diets
have been shown to slightly lower thyroid levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=2733"&gt;Ketogenic Diet &amp;amp; Its Effects On Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that makes sense because in ketogenic diets, blood glucose levels
are very low. And thyroid hormone is secreted in large part in
proportion to how much glucose is in the bloodstream and how much that
glucose, excuse me, needs to be regulated. So I'm not trying to
demonize the ketogenic diet. I think it definitely has its place.
There are 22 studies now showing that it can dramatically reduce blood
glucose. And about a third of those show that thyroid hormone levels
are slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, if not more, in the
ketogenic diet that may explain, I want to highlight may explain the
fact that when people go back to a more traditional diet if they've
been on a ketogenic diet for a long time, that oftentimes they will
gain weight very quickly as they bring carbohydrates back into their
diet. Some people are cycling between ketogenic and non-ketogenic
every three, four days. So-called cyclical ketogenic diet. Some people
are staying ketogenic for long periods of time. Some people six days
on, one day off. So there's a huge variation there. The point is that
carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates in particular, support the
healthy production of T3 and T4. And so if you're very low
carbohydrate, you're going to have a reduction in T3 and T4. And so if
you're going to bring carbohydrates back into your diet, then you
might want to do it more gradually. And for those of you that
menstruate, and are craving carbohydrates in the early part of the
cycle, that is actually associated with having a healthy cycle. If any
of you have had a healthy cycle on a ketogenic diet, that would be
interesting. Maybe let me know through the comments or point me in the
direction of some research if you're aware of it. So as you can start
to see, there's this really beautiful interplay between the different
hormones, between insulin and glucose, between estrogen and thyroid,
between thyroid and blood glucose and the ketogenic diet. It all
starts to fit together in ways that make a lot of sense once you
understand just kind of the core elements of what the hormones are and
the variety of tissues that they work on. The simple version of this
is if you haven't had a carbohydrate for a year, then your T3, T4
levels are going to be pretty low. And I'm sure there's some
ketonistas out there. They're going to say, wait, no, thyroid hormone
levels go up with keto. That might be true for other reasons, indirect
reasons related to hormone pathways that are cascade from being in
ketosis for long periods of time. Great. But for most people that
don't consume any carbohydrate, T3, T4 are going to go down. And when
they start to consume foods that require thyroid metabolism in order
to work with, to metabolize, then weight gain can sometimes happen
more quickly. So it's just something to consider. And it's something
to work with carefully if you're going to be cyclic ketogenic, long-
term ketogenic. And if you're not ketogenic, and you're consuming
carbohydrates. And the three things that we talked about earlier,
selenium, tyrosine and iodine, chances are unless there's an
underlying condition there that your levels of thyroid are going to be
in healthy range. Next, we're going to talk about growth hormone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=2919"&gt;Growth Hormone: What, Why &amp;amp; How&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth hormone has received a ton of attention in the last 20 years. I
actually remember when it was for sequenced. This was a huge deal.
There was a huge patent drama. I won't mention the universities of the
people involved. There were companies and monster patents and payouts
and it was really interesting. You can look that up online if you're
interested in some of the scientific history. Growth hormone is a
pretty straightforward one for you to understand now because it
follows the exact same logic as thyroid hormone. In fact, their
functions are so closely overlapping on the, you know, when we first
look at the face of it that you're probably going to think, why do you
have these two systems? So just very briefly, growth hormone-releasing
hormone. So remember releasing means it comes from the brain, comes
from the brain and tells the pituitary to release growth hormone, and
then growth hormone is released into the bloodstream where it goes and
acts on a ton of tissues, muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et cetera, to
increase metabolism. It sounds just like thyroid hormone. And they do
work in parallel. And that's why we've lumped them together in the
same episode. They increase metabolism and repair and growth of
tissues. A conversation about growth hormone would be incomplete if we
didn't talk about the kind of extremes. There are certain people who
are born that don't make enough growth hormone, and they end up very
short in stature. There are certain people who make a ton of growth
hormone and they end up very, very large. They tend to have very large
appendages. They have something called acromegaly. It's kind of like a
ridging of the forehead. It's actually a bone ridge. They are giant.
And it used to be called giantism. And most people of course are in a
range of height and appendage length. That doesn't imply that there's
a growth hormone disruption there. Growth hormone received a lot of
attention after it was sequenced because that meant the opportunity to
inject growth hormone and replace growth hormone that was lost. And
there was actually a lot of cases of people taking their kids and
trying to get them to be taller for whatever reason by injecting
growth hormone. Today, we're going to talk about the things that
anyone can do to increase growth hormone. And there are reasons why
certain people would want to do that. People who overproduce growth
hormone certainly would not want to do that. People who underproduce
it would probably want to do that. People that make normal, quote,
unquote, levels of growth hormone might want to do that as they age
because during puberty and development, the pituitary is churning out
tons of growth hormone. It's responsible for the growth, not
surprising, of the body and all its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=3078"&gt;Growth Hormone (GH) Changes Across The Lifespan &amp;amp; Risks of GH Therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Height, just being one of those. And so as we age, we make less growth
hormone. And that is one of the reasons why we recover more slowly
from injuries. It's one of the reasons why we accumulate body fat. And
it's one of the reasons why our metabolism slows. And so growth
hormone replacement therapy has been tremendously popular in the last
20 years, which is not to say it doesn't carry its problems, it does.
Here's one of the major problems with injecting growth hormone. Not
saying people shouldn't do this if the doctor has approved it or it's
in keeping with their particular life goals, but growth hormone, if
it's in levels that are too high, will cause growth of all tissues. So
not just muscle, not just reduction in body fat by metabolizing, you
know, by allowing fatty acids to be pulled out of storage and used for
ATP, but it will also cause increase in growth of the heart and the
lungs and the liver and the spleen. And so this is the concern with
abuse of growth hormone. So we're not going to be talking about abuse
of growth hormone. We will, however, talk about tools that anyone can
use to increase levels of growth hormone. Some of them are behavioral,
some of them are supplement-based and some of them interact with
behaviors and supplements. And what's cool about the discussion about
growth hormone is that the tools that exist out there to increase
growth hormone are very actionable. Most people can do these without
the need for any equipment or even any supplement. Although there are
some supplement related themes for tools for growth hormone increase.
And also the increases that one can get in growth hormone are
substantial. So normally, when you talk about the difference between
taking something as an exogenous substance like testosterone or
estrogen versus using supplements or behaviors to increase them,
you're talking about tenfold differences from, you know, administering
the prescription compound. In terms of growth hormone, there are
things that can increase growth hormone three, four, 500% or more. And
even though that's a short-lived increase, they can have very powerful
effects on metabolism and on repair of tissues. So let's talk about
those. Okay, let's go step by step in terms of the things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=3220"&gt;How To Powerfully Increase Growth Hormone: Know The Natural TriggerS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that anyone, perhaps everyone, should be doing in order to maintain
healthy growth hormone levels or increased growth hormone levels.
Unless you have overproduction of growth hormone, chances are these
things are going to benefit to you. However, as always, I want to
emphasize, talk to a doctor before you do anything, including remove
any treatments. So anything you would add or take away, that's the
responsibility of you and your healthcare provider, okay? I don't just
say that to protect me, I say that to protect you. First of all,
growth hormone is released every night when you go to sleep and it's
released in the early part of sleep, during so-called slow-wave sleep.
So the two conditions that have to be met in order for growth hormone
to be secreted regularly for tissue repair, et cetera, are you need to
get into slow-wave sleep that so-called deep sleep and you need blood
insulin and glucose to be relatively low. So eating within two hours
of sleep, excuse me, eating within two hours of going to sleep is
going to suppress growth hormone release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=3289"&gt;Not Eating Within 2hrs of Sleep: Keep Blood Glucose Low(ish) At Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's very clear. However, some people are going to have problems
falling asleep if they are too hungry. So you have to work with that
and decide what you're going to eat. And when you're going to eat that
thing so that you're not so hungry that you're having trouble falling
asleep. The episodes on sleep that were covered in episodes two,
three, and four of the Huberman Lab Podcast has, I believe, more tools
there than you could ever want or make use of in terms of how to
optimize sleep. So you can refer to those, if you like. So don't eat
too close to sleep and then get into slow-wave sleep. And as I talked
about in one of those earlier episodes, the first half of the night,
slow-wave sleep and deep sleep predominate. The second half of the
night, it's another kind of sleep, we call it REM sleep. So what is
special about this early phase of sleep? This is how you should be
thinking if you listen to this podcast. You should be thinking, okay,
I hear that something is important, it's related, it's in the pathway,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=3343"&gt;Delta Wave Brain Activity Is the Trigger For Growth Hormone Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but mechanistically when we say get into slow-wave sleep, get into
deep sleep, that's when growth hormone is secreted. The question you
should be asking yourselves as scientists of yourselves is wait, why
slow-wave sleep? What in particular about slow-wave deep sleep allows
the pituitary to release growth hormone? Like, what is it? Because if
you can understand that, if you can understand a little bit of
mechanism, there are actually ways that you can increase the amount of
growth hormone that you release both in sleep and out of sleep. So the
answer is it's delta wave activity in the brain. Delta waves are these
big giant waves of activity in the brain that correlate with slow-wave
sleep as opposed to faster waves of activity that is associated with
rapid eye movement sleep. So slow-wave sleep and the delta activity
actually triggers the neurons in the brain, the releasing hormone,
right? Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons to signal to the
pituitary. Now, how do I know this is true? And what can you do with
this? Well, we know this is true because researchers have taken people
and sleep deprived them, and they just asked, well, is it just one
period of time every 24 hours and then the pituitary releases growth
hormone? If that were the case, that would say that growth hormone is
just released in a so-called circadian dependent way. Every 24 hours
is the pulse of it, but no, it's always relating to slow-wave deep
sleep and delta waves. And this is cool because what it means is that
even if you're not measuring your brainwaves during sleep, which most
of you probably are not, you might be measuring slow-wave sleep or
deep sleep using a device like a Whoop or Oura. And even if you're
not, what this means is that during the day, there's the potential to
also increase growth hormone release if you can get the brain into the
so-called delta waves. And it turns out there are things you can do in
waking as well to increase growth hormone release. So we're going to
talk about those next. But as a tool and to just really make sure that
we put brackets around this, try and have blood glucose not too high.
So if you do need to eat close to bed, you wouldn't want to eat
anything that would increase blood glucose too much. Try not to eat
too close to bedtime. Get into deep sleep early in the night. Get the
growth hormone release. And understand that it's the delta waves of
activity, the sweeping big waves of activity in the neurons that
stimulate the brain to stimulate the pituitary. Because once you
understand that, then you have something to anchor to in terms of
thinking what are the things I can do in waking that will allow me to
release more growth hormone which for most people is going to be a
good thing. Several times before on this podcast, I've talked about
the fact that I'm not a big fan of melatonin supplementation for most
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=3505"&gt;LOW Doses of Melatonin Supplementation For Increasing GH Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be helpful under conditions of jet lag. However, there are a
lot of reasons why I personally don't like melatonin. It interacts
with the reproductive hormones, testosterone and estrogen, and that
whole access in ways that are unattractive, at least to me. It
suppresses puberty during development. It's present in much, much
higher doses in most supplements than one would normally make like a
hundred fold, 300 fold. However, today I'm going to talk about an
instance where very low levels of melatonin supplementation might
actually be advantageous. And that is aiding the transition to the
delta wave, slow-wave sleep I just described because that's the
pattern of sleep and brainwave activity that triggers growth hormone
release. So whereas most melatonin supplements are one milligram,
three milligrams, 12 milligrams, this kind of thing, that is super
physiological. There are some data showing that microgram, maybe 500
micrograms of melatonin, so half a milligram, can be beneficial in
shifting the pattern of early night's sleep toward more of the slow-
wave deep sleep delta activity and improving growth hormone release.
Not a lot of studies but the ones that I saw are quality. They were
done in subjects that, you know, both sexes, sufficient numbers, et
cetera. So this is interesting. So if you're interested in melatonin
supplementation, you might think about it just at very low levels. You
know, hundreds of micrograms as opposed to the milligram dosages. Most
of the ones out there are going to be in milligram dosages. So that's
one way that some studies have shown that you can increase the amount
of growth hormone that's secreted in early phases of sleep. Now, the
delta wave activity and the slow-wave activity in the brain being very
important for growth hormone release and growth hormone release being
so important for metabolic functions and peeling away unwanted body
fat and repairing tissues, et cetera, forces us to ask, well, what
other things can we do in waking in order to increase growth hormone
release? So let's start with the ones that have a potentially big
effect but are a little bit harder to access. And for that, I want to
point toward a book, which is really kind of interesting. It's not
focused on growth hormone but the book is called "Altered Traits."
This is the book. It's an excellent book,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=3660"&gt;Book: Altered Traits, Binaural Beats? Delta Waves Access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Altered Traits" by Goleman and Davidson. "Science Reveals How
Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body." Very interesting book.
For those of you that are interested in meditation, and perhaps those
of you who are not, but are considering it, what they talk about in
this book is the fact that meditation has two separate lines of
effects. One of those lines of effects are things that change your
state. So you're stressed. You sit down, you meditate and you relax
and you go into a particular state. The other are the changes that
occur over time and those are changes in trait. So personality can
actually change with long bouts of TM meditation or repeated
meditation. In any case, the reason we're talking about "Altered
Traits" today is because certain types of meditation can get people's
brains into states that very closely mimic slow-wave sleep. If you
hear snoring in the background, Costello is, sounds like he's in slow-
wave sleep. These big oscillatory snores that he's in 23.6 hours per
day. So what this means is for people that are interested in
increasing growth hormone, a meditation practice that allows you to
get into these slow-wave delta type frequency activity in the brain
may be very beneficial because as I mentioned before, that's what's
gating growth hormone release. It's not just a circadian phenomenon,
it's actually controlled by these brainwaves. I did look up binaural
beats. I get so many questions about binaural beats and it's a really
attractive idea, right? Binaural beats, for those of you don't know,
you listen to one frequency of tone in one ear and another frequency
of tone and the other ear, and then the brain essentially takes the
average of the two or there's some other wiring in the brainstem that
makes it not quite the average but it takes the average of the two for
sake of discussion. And that frequency is what the brain entrains or
maps onto. There are a lot of apps that are claiming that you can get
the brain into delta waves using binaural beats. I could not find
quality peer review studies supporting that, but I know there are a
lot of fans out there of binaural beats. If you know of any literature
that's independent of the company that makes the binaural beat
technology, so unbiased research, please send it my way. But in
"Altered Traits," Goleman and Davidson talk about the fact that people
who do 20 minutes of sitting meditation per day can access these slow-
wave sleep like brain states. Now, I've talked a lot on here about
non-sleep deep rest, things like yoga nidra and hypnosis. I'm not
aware that those will put people into slow-wave sleep per se, or delta
waves per se. So we're really talking about 20 minutes of more
traditional type meditation. Okay, so we've talked about very low
doses of melatonin as a way to trigger delta waves and more growth
hormone release in sleep. There's science to support that. We've now
talked about a waking behavior of 20 minutes of sort of what I would
call standard meditation or just sitting there, concentrating on one's
breathing to try and access delta waves. Binaural beats, no science
yet. Who knows? Maybe there's science to support it. If you're aware
of it, let me know. Now, let's move to the things that one can do that
have been shown to have what's, let's just be honest, pretty enormous
effects on growth hormone release in waking. And these are things that
are very actionable. One of the things that can have a dramatic effect
on levels of growth hormone release in waking as well as in sleep the
following night is exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=3875"&gt;Specific Types &amp;amp; Duration of Exercise That Stimulate Growth Hormone &amp;amp; Warmups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the key is the type of exercise and the duration. Now, there's a
logic to this. There are hundreds, if not thousands of studies
measuring growth hormone, both during or sometimes after exercise or
the following night. And the conclusion that one takes away from all
of these is that exercise has to be of particular duration and
intensity in order to get growth hormone release. So first I'm just
going to tell you what I found to be the maximum amount of growth
hormone release as it relates to a particular form of exercise. The
particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be
endurance training, but the endurance training and the weight training
actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes, not much longer. Now,
this is important because it's been shown over and over again that if
one exercises too long with weights or endurance exercise, that
cortisol levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the
testosterone and even the estrogen pathways. This is why I believe
people who overexercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual
cycles. They stop menstruating. It's why you get suppressions in
testosterone if people train too long and too hard. The cutoff has
always been, you know, 60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part. It's
going to vary a lot from person to person, but in terms of growth
hormone, the conditions that seem to lead to the greatest growth
hormone releases are one, get warm. This is interesting, we're going
to talk about temperature. So a proper warmup seems to accelerate the
release of growth hormone once the hard work phase starts. So 10
minutes of warmup or so was the number that I extracted from all these
studies. There's a beautiful review on this, by the way. Growth
hormone responses of varying, excuse me, "Growth hormone, arginine and
exercise." We'll talk about arginine in a few minutes. That's by
Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-E-Y. It was published in Current Opinion in
Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care. The Current Opinion journals
are generally of pretty high quality in terms of the reviews just
because they tend to be pretty recent. And then the references therein
are also quite good. So what does this mean? This means warm up. And
when you say warm up, it doesn't mean just warm up the limbs and
tissues that you're going to use so you don't get injured, actually
warm the body. So there was actually some discussion about whether or
not in cold winter months, people should wear like a stocking cap,
bringing the conditions, making the room warm. So getting the body
warm as a warmup seems to be important because temperature of the body
seems to be an important condition or prerequisite for certain
patterns of exercise to maximize growth hormone release. So it's
really interesting to me. I have an obsession with how body
temperature, light exercise and food interact. We're going right there
with the fact that if you get warm, you bring up the body temperature
a degree or two or maybe three, and then start exercise. It does
appear that high-intensity exercise, but again as discussed in a
previous episode, not exercise that brings muscles to failure but
close to it. So if it's weight-bearing exercise, it would be getting
close to that final repetitions where you can't complete them but not
pushing through those or even going to failure but getting close leads
to anywhere from 300 to 500% increases in resting growth hormone
levels and 300 to 500% increases in growth hormone the following night
when you go to sleep, which is incredible. Now, I want to dissect this
properly. Okay, so one of the other conditions that seem to be
important, again, was to have relatively low blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=4120"&gt;Keeping Low Blood Glucose &amp;amp; Ensuring A Cool Down For Two Phase GH Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's looking a lot like the conditions you need for sleep in order
to get maximum growth hormone release in sleep. So not having blood
glucose too high or too low, that's a discussion unto itself. You want
to have sufficient energy to do the exercise but getting warm, not
having blood glucose too high or too low. So probably not eating too
close to exercise or not in ingesting a lot of sugars during the
exercise. That was supported by the fact that ingestion of a sports
drink that contains caloric sugar immediately flat-line the growth
hormone levels. So really interesting relationship between insulin,
glucose and growth hormone. So then doing the training for anywhere
from 60 to 75 minutes to maximize growth hormone release. And then the
other interesting thing was that even after the exercise, taking body
temperature back down to normal levels relatively quickly seemed to be
associated with these big spikes in growth hormone. Otherwise, what
would happen is you get these big spikes in growth hormone, but if the
exercise went too long or if body temperature remained too high for
too long, then you didn't get the second increase in growth hormone
the following night, okay? So I hope I made that abundantly clear.
Warm up well, get body temperature up, exercise 60 to 75 minutes.
Don't go to absolute failure if your interest is in growth hormone
release both during the exercise and later that night. And if you can
bring body temperature back down to normal levels by cooling off,
maybe cool shower or maybe ice pack or something, or maybe just
turning off the heat in the room or going outside, whatever it is,
then you increase the probability that you're going to increase growth
hormone the following night as well. And again, these are big
increases, 300 to 500%. It's almost like you're getting a second sleep
during the day. But if the exercise is too hard, if body temperature
stays too high for too long, you disrupt the whole process and you
don't get the effect of increased growth hormone. Growth hormone is
really powerful but it doesn't work alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=4236"&gt;Sex Differences For WHEN During Exercise Growth Hormone and IGF-1 Release Occurs: Males Have To Last Longer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a lot of the effects of growth hormone are mediated by its
effects on the liver. So growth hormone is released, goes to the
liver, and then the liver releases something called IGF-1, insulin
growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 was popular in the
neuroscience community as an area of focus because of its ability to
trigger improvements in memory and learning after exercise. And indeed
exercise triggers both the release of growth hormone and IGF-1. IGF-1
seems responsible for a lot of the effects of improved memory. Some
people report that that is due to increased number of neurons or
neurogenesis, birth of new neurons. It's pretty clear that in humans,
that's not what's happening. Yes in animals, not in humans. IGF-1
nonetheless has positive effects on memory and cognition. And a great
way to trigger IGF-1 release and growth hormone release is through
exercise. Now, the interesting thing, and the reason I'm bringing up
IGF-1 here is that certain patterns of exercise, actually duration of
exercise have different effects on IGF-1 and growth hormone, depending
on whether or not the exercise is done by men or women. There's what
we call sex-dependent effect. And the sex-dependent effect is as
follows. In this particular study and several others, what they did is
they had people exercise. They measured growth hormone and IGF-1
levels from the blood before, during and after exercise. And they
could see when the greatest increases occurred. This was standard
sorts of resistance exercise. So some squats. There was a sprint like
activity. It doesn't really matter what the specific exercises were.
None of them were to failure. These were in kind of the 10 repetition
or less range, six sets. So kind of standard weight training stuff
that anyone might do. But what was interesting is that women were able
to access the biggest peak in growth hormone and IGF-1 early in the
exercise. So in the first 30 minutes. So what this means is even if
you just have 30 minutes, at least for women, there's going to be a
big increase in growth hormone and IGF-1 in the first 30 minutes. For
men, the biggest increase occurred later in the exercise, which was at
60 minutes or so total. And so the sex-dependent effects are
interesting. They point to the fact that things like cortisol,
testosterone, and estrogen, which of course vary in different levels
in men and women are going to impact the release of things like IGF-1
and growth hormone. And yes, they did control for all sorts of things
like diet and they controlled for weight and prior experience. It's
actually a quite nice study. If you'd like to check it out, it's by a
Pierce et al, "Growth Hormone and Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular
Weight Isoform Response to Resistance Exercise Are Sex-Dependent" in
Frontiers in Endocrinology, fine journal in 2020. So it's quite
recent. So what does this mean? This means if you're exercising and
you want growth hormone release, warm up, do the type of exercise that
we've been discussing. Women, in the first 30 minutes, is when you're
going to get the maximum benefit in terms of growth hormone and IGF-1.
Men, you have to keep going for the entire 60 minutes. So don't tap
out early if you're interested in getting the growth hormone and IGF-1
release. And the same conditions apply about then cooling down and not
making the exercise last so long that you don't get the increase in
growth hormone the following night. My experience thus far in doing
this podcast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=4450"&gt;Supplements That Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine, Ornithine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is that people fall into one of two categories. There are the just
tell me what to take people, the people that are really eager to try
supplements and maybe in prescription compounds. And then there are
people who are a little bit more shy about supplementation. They are
more focused on what they can do with diet and behaviors and things of
that sort. I don't have a bias either way. I try and offer tools that
are supported by the scientific literature. And I always point to
safety margins. There are supplements that can increase growth hormone
to a considerable degree and no, these aren't growth hormone itself.
Although, that of course will increase growth hormone to a
considerable degree. We will talk about prescription drugs at the end,
not just growth hormone, but some other things that are quite
prominently in use right now, in particular in the entertainment
industry. There are pretty interesting compounds. But first let's talk
about supplements. So this has been known about for some time but
arginine, the amino acid arginine, as well as the amino acid ornithine
can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine has a
number of effects. You can get it from food, you can get it from
supplements. Some people take it in pill form or capsule form. Some
people will actually take it by IV, intravenously. The levels and the
amounts of arginine required to get big growth hormone release
increases is pretty substantial. So some people will take arginine
before bedtime, some people will take it before exercise. The
prerequisite again is low blood glucose. Blood glucose is high, it's
going to quash the effect. The amounts of arginine that people take
are anywhere from three grams to 10 grams, or sometimes even more.
Although, this is definitely a case of more is not better. There's a
threshold at which growth hormone release is actually blunted by
taking more than nine grams of arginine. Now, nine grams of arginine
orally is a lot of pills. It's at minimum nine pills. And it can cause
some GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. Some people will
throw it up. Some people get some constipation or diarrhea, et cetera,
or just stomachaches. I'm certainly not suggesting people do this that
they take arginine but that's the reason why most of the studies that
looked at the role of arginine on growth hormone levels did it by IV,
intravenous infusion. So what's interesting, however, is that whether
or not it's by mouth or by vein, taking arginine can dramatically
increase growth hormone release and the levels or the amount of
increase was anywhere from 100 on the low-end but anywhere basically
from 400 to 600% above baseline. So these are huge increases in growth
hormone. Now, I've never tried arginine. Arginine is out there for a
number of different purposes. One of them is to increase growth
hormone. Some of the supplements out there to increase growth hormone
include arginine and ornithine. Arginine does have the effect of
dilating arterials. And it basically increases blood supply. The
arginine pathway is involved in vasodilation. It's actually the
pathway that's downstream of a lot of drugs that are used to treat
things like erectile dysfunction. And anytime people have problems
with peripheral blood flow of any kind, they focus on compounds that
will either disrupt the enzymes or will adjust the levels of amino
acids to get more vasodilation. So taking arginine for the purpose of
increasing growth hormone will also have the effect of dilating blood
vessels and for people with blood, excuse me, with heart conditions,
that actually can be a serious issue. Now, here is something really
important and interesting to note,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=4700"&gt;Arginine &amp;amp; Exercise Together Can Be Counter-Productive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is that increasing arginine levels with the specific goal of
increasing growth hormone release can actually short circuit the
effects of exercise on growth hormone. Several studies that I looked
at, looked at the interaction of taking arginine and the exercise or
just the arginine or just the exercise alone. And so you don't,
unfortunately, if growth hormone increase is your goal, you don't
unfortunately get to increase growth hormone 800% by taking arginine
and exercising. It always seems to be clamped at about 300 to 500%
increases. Still large increases. So I make that point for several
reasons. First of all, be aware that arginine has these other effects
on vasodilation. Take those seriously if you have a heart condition or
take them seriously in any case. Second of all, you can supplement
with arginine, not exercise and get these big increases in growth
hormone by taking them before sleep. But if you're taking the arginine
before exercise, you're going to short circuit or clamp the effects of
exercise on growth hormone, okay? So it's something that one could use
but it doesn't have a synergistic effect with exercise. The two more
or less cancel each other out, not to zero, but you end up with the
same effect you would had you done one or the other. So hopefully
that's clear. The other thing is if one's goal is really to increase
arginine in the blood for whatever reason, arginine may not actually
be the best way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=4790"&gt;L-Citrulline Better For Arginine Than Arginine Itself (?!); &amp;amp; Blood Pressure Caution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the way it's metabolized in the gut, it doesn't have access
or get access to the tissues that you're most interested in in terms
of increasing growth hormone or vasodilation for that matter. And in
that case, there's something else called L-citrulline which has
powerful effects on vasodilation, powerful effects potentially on
growth hormone levels via the arginine pathway. But basically
L-citrulline, it acts as sort of a donor, or it's kind of a biological
prerequisite for arginine and can lead to even bigger arginine
increases than you would get if you took arginine itself. And so
L-citrulline is out there. Keep in mind that anything that dilates the
blood vessels will lower blood pressure. So L-citrulline, yes, will
lead to increase blood flow for whatever purpose you want to use it
for, whether or not that's pumps in the gym or whatever. It also can
lead to big increases in arginine and growth hormone, but it will
lower blood pressure. So be aware of that. And understand that the
biology isn't so straightforward. L-citrulline may actually be the
better way to get arginine increases than arginine itself. And
ornithine can also increase growth hormone, although that's also
through an indirect pathway. And nowadays, there isn't a lot of focus
on ornithine as a way to increase growth hormone. That was kind of all
the rage in the 90s, not so much anymore. Nowadays, the people are
really in the know for this stuff tend to focus on L-citrulline. And
if you're interested in L-citrulline or arginine, I highly recommend
you go to our old friend, good friends, examine.com, because there you
can put it into their list. You can just put search and it's totally
free. And it will tell you that blood pressure will be slightly
decreased. Power output in the gym will increase. There's very strong
effects on blood glucose. Fatigue is reduced notably. Big increases in
nitric oxide. That's also related to the increase in vasodilation.
Plasma arginine, very high, excuse me, notable effects, very high
support for studies, which allow people more training volume, aerobic
exercise, arterial stiffness is brought down. There's a huge list of
things. Increase in growth hormone. So two studies showing, this was
done double-blind. Great, you always want to see double-blind, placebo
controlled. This was only done in males, not in females.
Unfortunately, just have data from males but increases in growth
hormone, it's a small, but a real significant effect. And again, from
quality studies. So there's a huge number of effects there. And some
of the other kind of more interesting ones about L-citrulline that you
might not have thought about are things like muscle oxygenation as we
scroll down, decreases in c-reactive protein. So a lot of the same
things that you might affect, expect, excuse me, from the same sorts
of compounds we saw before. The takeaway here is if you want to
increase growth hormone, think about the arginine pathway, but
arginine itself might not be the best direct route to get there.
L-citrulline might be a better option. But please do consider take
very seriously the effects on blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=4989"&gt;Growth Hormone Changes Across The Lifespan: No One Escapes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we've been talking about big effects from supplementation or
exercise on growth hormone, this extremely powerful hormone. And one
thing to note is that the profile of growth hormone as we age,
changes, I mentioned that earlier, but it's important to understand
how it changes. One thing that's particularly interesting to me as
somebody who's in his 40s is that it's actually between ages 30 and 40
that the amount of growth hormone that you release each night is
reduced by two to threefold. That's really incredible. You know, we
hear so much about testosterone levels going down as we age or
estrogen levels going down. But if you recall from the testosterone
and estrogen episode, we talked about the fact that if you really look
at the data, just for instance, on testosterone, there are men in
their 90s and they are not rare, it turns out, that are making as much
testosterone and DHT, dihydrotestosterone, as they were in their 20s,
okay? So we hear so much nowadays about how testosterone levels are
dropping, sperm levels are dropping, et cetera. And I don't dispute
that. I talked about that in that episode. But it's clear that
testosterone levels vary tremendously from person to person. And just
getting older does not necessarily mean that testosterone levels are
dropping. Growth hormone levels, it seems, are dropping when people
are in their 30s and 40s and they're dropping substantially. And that
seems to be the case across the board. You're just not going to find
people in their 40s, 50s and 60s that are making as much growth
hormone as they were in their teens and 20s. And as somebody who, I
feel really good, but as somebody who definitely noticed that as I got
into my 40s that even if I slept the same amount, I wasn't feeling
quite as I would say able to recover from exercise or wound healing
even with the same amount of sleep. And I was trying to optimize a
great number of things. This business of growth hormone became a
particular interest to me. And since the ways to manipulate growth
hormone in men and women are so straightforward. And since everybody
goes through this age-related decline very dramatically, it seems to
me that the things that we're supposed to be doing anyway, like
exercising, like trying not to eat too close to bedtime, trying to
optimize sleep. All of these are wonderful tools that we should be
pursuing and perhaps using. And they can actually offset the two to
three fold decrease, right? If we're talking about a two to threefold
decrease for people that are in their 30s and 40s. And then we're
talking about increases from exercise or maybe from supplementation
but certainly from exercise of 300 to 500%. Well, then, all of a
sudden we're in a position to actually offset the age-related decline
in growth hormone completely just through behaviors. And I think
that's quite interesting and quite powerful. Now, I'd like to discuss
a way that anyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=5160"&gt;Heat (&amp;amp; Cold) for Triggering Extremely Large Increases In Growth Hormone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can increase their levels of growth hormone dramatically. And when I
say dramatically, I mean dramatically. I'll get to the numbers in a
couple minutes. But we have to remember how growth hormone is released
in the first place. Remember, it all starts in the brain, in the
hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a brain area that controls things
like sexual behavior, temperature regulation, circadian behavior,
meaning when you want to be awake and when you want to be asleep,
aggression, all of that. There are other brain areas involved too but
it has a rich collection of different neurons involved in all these
very basic functions. Now, as we talked about the releasing hormones,
the growth hormone-releasing hormone, it comes from neurons in the
hypothalamus. Those then communicate with the pituitary and the
pituitary releases growth hormone and then the growth hormone acts on
all these different tissues, muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body
fat. Makes them use energy. That's why you lose body fat when growth
hormone levels are high. It makes you grow muscle, strengthens bones,
et cetera. Now, one of the things that has a profound effect on growth
hormone levels, growth hormone release, is temperature. Now, the data
on this are very strong and the data come from both animal studies and
human studies. So there are a number of studies that have explored how
making animals cold or hot can increase growth hormone. And if you're
guessing which direction this is going to go, you can probably imagine
that making animals or people warmer is the way to go if you want to
increase growth hormone. Now, anytime you're going to increase
temperature of yourself or anyone else or an animal, it is risky. I
want to be really clear about this. Not everyone should engage in the
behaviors I'm about to describe. And I should just say the reason it's
risky is it doesn't take much of a temperature increase in the brain
to cook the brain, to cook neurons. And after that point, neurons
can't come back. And people can die from hyperthermia. We have a much
greater range in terms of cold. You can also die of hypothermia. You
can freeze to death. But you have a much greater range of getting cold
than you do warming up the brain. However, there are really strong
data pointing to the fact that sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia, not
too high, however, that sauna can increase the release of growth
hormone and other hormones. And what's so dramatic about this
literature is the size of the effects that are reported. So first of
all, let's talk about these temperature increases. And yes, I will
refer to things that people can do even if you don't own a sauna
because I realized not everybody has a sauna in their backyard or has
access to a sauna. So first of all, recall our study about exercise
where warming up a few degrees before the exercise led to bigger and
quicker increases in growth hormone during the exercise about itself.
So that already point in the direction that temperature was important.
Now, the degrees, no pun intended, that we're talking about increasing
body temperature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=5360"&gt;Specific Heat Protocols For Increasing Growth Hormone: Up To 16-Fold (?!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is by entering saunas that are somewhere between 176 degrees
Fahrenheit, so that's 80 degrees Celsius, and all the way up to like
210, 215 degrees Fahrenheit. I personally know people that go even
higher than that but they've trained themselves to deal with very high
heats. And again, high heat is dangerous. You must clear this with
your doctor. Now, what happens in high heat? A couple things happen in
high heat. First of all, you start getting bigger stroke volume of the
heart. Kind of like an exercise. Once you get well-trained in
endurance activity, your stroke volume and the amount of blood that
your heart can pump each time gets larger. You dilate the blood
vessels, right? There are a lot of things that happen also. You're
sweating. Your body's trying to unload heat. Dilation of blood
vessels, arginine, increases in heat. We're starting to see and hear a
common theme. But it appears that getting into, I'm not saying getting
the body up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit, I want to be very clear, I'm
not talking about getting the body up to 100 degrees Celsius. That
would be terrible. You would die. But entering environments where it's
very hot for short periods of time, anywhere from 20 minutes to 30
minutes, where the temperature is 80 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees
Celsius or 175 degrees Fahrenheit, more or less, to about 210 degrees
Fahrenheit, more or less, has been shown to increase growth hormone
release 16 fold. That's right, 16 fold. That's 1,600%. Now, there are
also effects on other hormones, prolactin, cortisol, et cetera. So the
pattern that was described in this study and there've been many
studies now. Endocrine effects of repeated sauna were done in 17
humans. This was from doing this repeatedly. So it wasn't the first
time they did this. They had to do this three days in a row. And the
pattern was to get into the sauna for 20 minutes, followed by a
30-minute cooling period. Remember, you don't want to spend long
periods of time at high heat. You can cook your brain and other
tissues. Be very careful as you approach this if you decide to. But 30
minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna, followed by 30 minutes of
cooling, followed by 20 minutes sauna again, led to a five fold
increase in growth hormone. And then by doing that day after day after
day, on the third day, you would see these huge increases of like 16
fold, up to 16 fold. And there are now many studies like this. This
was described a few years ago, but since then, there've been a number
of other studies that have pointed in the direction of deliberate
hyperthermia, but not too hot that you kill yourself in order to
increase growth hormone. And I know I keep highlighting the dangers
there, but again, anytime you're going to mess with heat, you have to
be cautious, you have to be careful. So standard sauna can be useful.
If you don't have access to a sauna, one way that people do this, we
have to look to our friends, the wrestlers, right? They wear plastics,
which are basically bodysuits that are fairly inexpensive that you can
buy on any online purchase platform, I should say. Some people in the
old days before they had these plastic things so readily available. I
actually knew people that wrapped themselves in garbage bags and then
throw on sweats and a hoodie and then go out for a jog. Again, you
have to be really careful, especially on a hot day. Overheating can
equate to death. But that's another way to heat up. You don't actually
need a sauna. I've known people who will do this in hotel rooms while
they're traveling. They'll turn on the heat, you know, make a hot
bath. They won't actually get in the bath but they'll fill the room
with steam and heat and they'll put on a hoodie and some sweatshirt,
sweat pants, and they'll sit there with wool socks on and they'll get
warm for 20 minutes, then they'll take a cool shower, and then they'll
do it again. I guess when the hotel is paying the water bill, you
don't worry about it too much. Some people of course own saunas. There
are a lot of ways to do that. I have friends who were in the military
who made saunas out of cars while they were overseas. All sorts of
things. You do have to be careful. I know I've said it many, many
times. I just don't want anyone to hurt themselves. But these
increases in growth hormone are tremendous. And what they probably
stem from are increased activity of neurons within the hypothalamus
that stimulate growth hormone release from the pituitary. And that's
probably because the growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons in the
hypothalamus sit very closely and may even be intermixed with some of
the neurons in the hypothalamus that regulate heat and body
temperature. Remember, metabolism is impart a heat. It's like a
furnace of how much energy you're consuming and using for building or
for energy usage purposes. So sauna can be very, very interesting. And
again, it's 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling, 20 minutes again, proceed
with extreme caution, but nonetheless, these are pretty extreme
effects in terms of their abilities to increase growth hormone levels.
Along the lines of temperature and hormones, I just want to mention a
very recent study, it just came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=5670"&gt;2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, &amp;amp; Lowers Cortisol, No Effects On Testosterone, DHEA Or Prolactin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March, April, 2021, "Endocrine Effects of Repeated Hot Thermal Stress
and Cold Water Immersion in Young Adult Men." Unfortunately, it was
just in men, they didn't look at women, but nonetheless I think the
data are relevant to everybody as a general theme. This is Podstawski
et al. I will put a link to the study in the caption and they looked
at testosterone, prolactin, cortisol, et cetera. And what they found
was that the sauna does indeed lead to a significant decrease in
cortisol, a stress hormone, a hormone that you want to be released
early in the day when you wake up. But sauna definitely led to
significant decrease in cortisol but did not change testosterone, DHEA
or prolactin levels. So that's interesting. And it turns out that the
cold did affect some of these hormones but the results there were a
little bit more mixed. So the takeaway here is that heat seems to have
positive effects on growth hormone, big effects. It seems to have
positive effects on reducing cortisol levels. And it does not seem to
have effects on things like testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin directly.
You can imagine that a shift in any hormone is going to alter the
levels of other hormones down the lines or have indirect effects but
in terms of direct effects just during or immediately after the sauna
bath, there were no effects. So we've talked about diet,
supplementation, behavioral tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=5760"&gt;Prescription Growth Hormone, &amp;amp; Emerging Peptides Therapeutics, Secretagogues Etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, we talked about the underlying biology and logic. And
hopefully you heard the safety precautions for all of those. Now, I'd
like to just briefly talk about the prescription side of all this.
There are, as we know, many people taking growth hormone because it's
been prescribed to them by a doctor. And presumably there are people
taking growth hormone even though it has not been prescribed by a
doctor, which is none of my business. But the point here is that most
all of the hormones that we make have been synthesized. So there are
versions of them in little bottles or little ampules that people can
inject. Here are a couple of important things to consider if you're
going to go that route. First of all, talk to a physician, all right?
They actually are only legally available through a physician. Second
of all, anytime you're injecting something, you're going to shut down
your own production. That's the way that the hormone system works. If
you take thyroid hormone, you won't make thyroid hormone, at least in
the long run. If you take testosterone, you will shut down your own
production of testosterone. If you take estrogen, the system's a
little more resilient but eventually you will shut down your
production of estrogen. And the same is true for growth hormone. So a
decision to go that route of taking something is often not always a
decision to do it forever. However, if you're willing to sustain a
period of being without a given hormone, some people can do things and
then stop taking them, and then wait out the period in which they're
not making testosterone, estrogen or growth hormone, and then it will
come back, sometimes and sometimes it won't. There's a kind of new
area that's developing now that I think deserves our attention, not
because I'm encouraging it, but because it is happening. And in
keeping with the science and in keeping with trying to keep things
modern, it's worth us discussing. And those are peptides. So these
days you hear a lot about peptides. I'd like to clarify a little bit
about what peptides are. Peptides is a really huge category of
biological compounds. Peptides are just strings of amino acids, right?
So we've talked about L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine. Those are amino
acids. Those are individual amino acids. And those are put together
into little small peptides or they're what are called polypeptides,
which are just longer peptides. It turns out that for any substance
like growth hormone or growth hormone-releasing hormone, it's made up
of different amino acids in different sequences, just like your genes
are made up of As and Gs and Cs and Ts, nucleotides in different
sequences. It's like a recipe. Peptides tend to be short sequences of
amino acids that resemble a hormone enough or resemble some other
peptide enough that it can lead to the similar same effects when you
inject them. So for example, we make growth hormone-releasing hormone
from our brain which stimulates growth hormone from the pituitary.
You're probably getting tired of me saying that by now. But people now
will take things like sermorelin, S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin,
which is not the entire peptide sequence of growth hormone-releasing
hormone but it's a subset of those. And when people inject it before
they go to sleep at night is typically how it's done on an empty
stomach. Then that stimulates the release of growth hormone from the
pituitary. So this is not taking growth hormone, this is taking the
stimulating hormone or what's often called a secretagogue or a mimic,
all right? It causes a secretion of the hormone that one wants. People
will do this for thyroid hormone, too. Some people are doing this by
prescription with a real medical need. Other people are doing it for
just longevity reasons, which kind of falls into that gray zone of
they wouldn't die without it, but they want to enhance their life and
so they're doing that because they believe it's the right thing for
them, prescription. Sermorelin is prescription. Do they work? Yes. Do
they shut down your natural production of growth hormone-releasing
hormone? Well, there, the answer is yes but some of these peptides
actually have the effect of changing gene expression. Remember, way
back to the beginning when I was talking about hormones, they can
actually change gene expression and they can actually set pathways in
motion for continued production of a hormone even if you stop taking
the compound. Now, that can be good or that can be bad because as you
recall, growth hormone, big increases in growth hormone that are
short-lived like sauna, or, you know, I should say exercise or
arginine or sauna, it seems like has these huge effects. Or early
nights, you know, first phase of sleep early in the night, these sorts
of things. Those are transient. But when one is injecting over and
over at constant level, you can put into action gene expression
programs that can be long lived. And let's say, you have a particular
tumor in the body. Tumors will grow when they see growth hormone even
if that tumor is unhealthy for you, right? You've got growth of
tissues all over the body. So again, I'm not saying whether or not
people should do these things or not doing them. One thing I do know
is that they are in very prominent use in the movie industry. People
who want to peel off body fat quickly, they do increase recovery time.
They increase healing rates. People are also injecting things like
gastric peptides. They're actually stomach peptides that we talked
about in the previous episode, things related to the ghrelin pathway
and other things from the liver that can improve the rate of tissue
and wound healing. You can bet that in the upcoming Olympics, lot of
people are using peptides and compounds and I'm not pointing fingers
at anyone in particular. It's just this is separate from hormone
augmentation of like injecting GH or injecting testosterone. People
are now working further up the pathways. Other names of some of the
peptides are things like ipamorelin, tesamorelin. Some of these have
clinical uses. Others have just been made as compounds for people in
the kind of longevity field or the self-augmentation field, if you
will. So again, not promoting their use but they're definitely out
there. And so now if you hear about them or if someone's talking to
you about them, now hopefully you have a better understanding about
their underlying biology. And you can think rationally about whether
or not they are the right decision for you. Okay, once again, covered
an enormous amount of material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qbJeRxWGw&amp;amp;t=6145"&gt;Synthesis, Summary Of Actionable Steps For Increasing GH and Thyroid Hormone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, now you understand thyroid hormone and what it does and a
little bit about its mechanism or maybe a lot and growth hormone and
what it does and how both of them take care of our metabolism. They
dictate how many nutrients we can eat and make use of. They can pull
from body fat stores, repair muscle, repair cartilage. They really are
incredible compounds. And they're actionable. They're things that we
can do, like getting that early phase of sleep, perhaps supplementing
with arginine, maybe not, hopefully getting adequate exercise, warming
up properly, not making the exercise too long or too intense will
help, maybe sauna or things like it. You know, deliberate, safe
hyperthermia, with the emphasis on safe, might be things that are of
use. Regardless, even if you're not interested in the thyroid or the
growth hormone pathways, this brings to a close our month on hormones.
And so now hopefully you understand not just thyroid and growth
hormone but the logic that underlies thyroid hormone, growth hormone,
estrogen, testosterone, why we eat, why we stop eating,
cholecystokinin, ghrelin. If these names don't mean anything to you,
then perhaps go back and listen to those episodes. But regardless, I
hope that you come away from this with a deeper understanding about
these hormones which are so powerful in controlling the way our brain
functions and the interplay between the brain and hormones because it
is really a bidirectional conversation. The brain is telling body what
hormones to make. The hormones are influencing all the tissues of the
body but also telling the brain whether or not to eat more or grow
more or think more, et cetera. So I really appreciate your time and
attention.&lt;/p&gt;

adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain
the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop
eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-
rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when
we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to
leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating
until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our
gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far
more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon
work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes
function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid
levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements,
prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to
regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce
sugar cravings by triggering the release of the hormone CCK, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [gentle music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that
theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first
sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition
platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better
understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long
been a fan of getting blood work done. And the simple reason for that,
is that most of the things that you want to know about your health,
such as hormones, metabolic factors, blood sugar levels, et cetera,
can only be analyzed from blood. And nowadays there are also excellent
DNA tests that can also give you valuable information about what's
going on at the cellar, molecular, even the neural circuit level
within your brain and body. InsideTracker makes getting blood and DNA
tests easy. You can go to a testing site where they draw your blood,
they take your DNA sample, or they can come to your home if you prefer
that. As well, they have a really amazing dashboard. The dashboard
lets you understand what your levels of various hormones and metabolic
factors et cetera mean, and what you should do about them. And I think
that's one of the main things that really separates InsideTracker
apart from other blood and DNA tests. Most tests you get the results
back, but there are no directives about what to do specifically in
order to bring the numbers into the ranges that you would like for
your goals. InsideTracker makes all of that extremely simple and
extremely clear. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to

taking Athletic Greens back in 2012 and I've taken it ever since. So
I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I
started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take it now, is
that Athletic Greens really lets me cover all my nutritional basis in
terms of vitamins, minerals and probiotics. There's so much data now
pointing to the fact that the gut microbiome and the gut brain axis is
important for metabolism and for endocrine health. The vitamins,
minerals and probiotics in Athletic Greens make me feel confident that
I'm covering all my bases. I do take other supplements, but with
Athletic Greens I know that I've got all the foundational stuff
handled. It also tastes really good. Tastes fine on its own, you can
mix it with water, which is what I do. I add a little bit of lemon
juice or lime juice, because I like a little tartness flavor in there
as well, but most people just mix it with water, it mixes up super
easily. I drink it once or twice a day. Usually once mid morning, and
once again in the afternoon. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you
can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you can
claim their special offer which is a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
There is now a ton of evidence that vitamin D3 is involved in
countless metabolic processes, hormonal processes that are important
for overall health and wellbeing. Vitamin D3, you can get from the sun
of course, but most people are deficient in vitamin D3. So if you go
to athleticgreens.com/huberman you'll get the Athletic Greens, you'll
get the year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2 and you'll get five free
travel packs. So once again it's athleticgreens.com/huberman, to get
Athletic Greens, the vitamin D3K2, and that's a year supply plus the
five free travel packs. Today's episode is also brought to us by Munk
Pack. Munk Pack is a company that makes keto-friendly snacks that
taste incredible but have just one gram of sugar or less. And indeed
they taste incredible. In fact, my production team here at the
Huberman Lab Podcast teases me because I actually have to keep the
boxes of Munk Pack bars in my basement 'cause otherwise I'll tear
through all of them. I remember the first time I tasted it, I was
like, all right, here we go, a keto bar. I'm not a big fan of bars in
general, most of them don't taste good to me. And I tasted the Munk
Pack bars, and they are absolutely awesome. They come in a lot of
different flavors. I'm partial to the caramel sea salt one, but they
also have sea salt dark chocolate, peanut butter dark chocolate. They
have a bunch of flavors. They're all incredible, I've tried them all.
Which is why I keep them in my basement. As I mentioned previously on
this podcast, I'm neither keto nor carbo. I don't really follow a
particular diet in that sense. I eat in a way that maximizes my
alertness and my levels of focus during the day when I want to work,
and that maximize my transition to sleep at night. So, I basically eat
low carb keto-ish during the day. And I know the ketonistas will say
that I'm not in ketosis and I can manage to get into ketosis. But the
main idea, is I keep my carbohydrates low during the day. And then at
night I do eat carbohydrates. So for me, the Munk Pack bars are a
really good snack usually in the afternoon, with a cup of coffee,
especially if I'm going to train soon after that, or if I just want to
snack and I'm going to continue working. As I mentioned before, they
are absolutely delicious. They also don't have any of the stuff that's
bad for you. No soy, trans fat, sugar, alcohols, artificial colors,
all that stuff that we know we should avoid. If you want to try Munk
Pack bars, you can go to Munk Pack, that's M-U-N-K, MunkPack.com, and

incredible and they control so many processes in the brain and body.
Last episode, we talked about the role of estrogen and testosterone.
Today we're going to talk about how hormones impact feeding and
hunger, as well as satiety, the feeling that you don't want to eat or
that you've eaten enough. Now, it's important to understand that
hormones don't work alone in this context. Today I'm going to describe
some hormones that have powerful effects on whether or not you want to
eat more or less or stop eating altogether. But they don't do that on
their own, they do that in cooperation with the nervous system. So
today, I would say as much or perhaps even more than any other
episodes, we're going to hear a lot of biology but there are multiple
what I'm going to call entry points for tools that you can apply in
order to regulate your levels of hunger, your meal timing, your levels
of satiety of not wanting to eat more. And many of this is actionable
with behaviors, but of course, we're also going to talk about
supplements and we're actually going to talk about a little bit of
brain machine interface devices that can actually be involved in
manipulating these incredible things that we think of as hunger and
appetite and satiety. So, the first thing that you need to know about
the nervous system side, the neural control, over-feeding and hunger,
is that there's an area of your brain called the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=419"&gt;Hunger: Neural &amp;amp; Hormonal Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's in the forebrain, which tells you it's in the front of your
brain, and it's at the base of the forebrain. Now, the hypothalamus
contains lots of different kinds of neurons doing lots of different
kinds of things. There are neurons in your hypothalamus controlling
sexual behavior, controlling body temperature, controlling circadian
rhythms, the desire to sleep or be awake. Even neurons controlling
rage. There are actually neurons that if we were to stimulate them
would send you or anyone into a rage. They're just powerful control
centers for the brain and body. There's a particular area of the
hypothalamus called the ventromedial hypothalamus. And it's one that
researchers have been interested for a long time now, in terms of its
relationship to hunger and feeding. And the reason is, it creates
these paradoxical effects. What do I mean by that? What they found was
that sometimes lesioning, or disrupting the neurons in the
ventromedial hypothalamus would make animals or people hyperphasia,
they would want to eat crazy. And other lesions in other individuals
or animals would make them anorexic, it would make them not want to
eat at all. It would make food aversive. So that means that the
ventromedial hypothalamus is definitely an interesting control station
for hunger and feeding and satiety, but it doesn't really tell you
what's going on at a deeper level. In fact, it's a little bit
confusing or paradoxical. It turns out that there are multiple
populations of neurons in there, we're going to talk about those. Some
are promoting feeding, and some are promoting not feeding or not
eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=512"&gt;Chewing &amp;amp; Hunger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the other neural component of all this that you need to know
about, actually has to do with your mouth. So there's an area of your
cortex, so that's a little bit further up in your brain, called the
insular cortex. And it processes a lot of different kinds of
information. Mostly information about what's going on inside you, so
called the interoception. The insular cortex has neurons that get
input from your mouth, from the touch receptors in your mouth. And
insular cortex has powerful control over whether or not you're
enjoying what you're eating, whether or not you want to avoid what
you're eating, whether or not you had enough, or whether or not you
want to continue eating more. And that has to do, believe it or not,
with the touch or sensation of eating. I'm very familiar with this.
I'm one of these people, I love eating so much, that I just like the
mere act of chewing. You know, I like celery sticks enough. I'm not
crazy about them, but you know they taste fine to me and I like
chewing on celery sticks, but I actually just like chewing on them. I
could eat all day long except that it's not healthy to do that. But
the mere act of chewing for me is very pleasurable. People who chew
gum feel this way as well. And just as a point about gum or chewing,
if you choose something like celery or cucumber slices or chew gum,
provided it doesn't have any sugar or caloric content, it's not going
to drive increased hunger. That generally isn't the case. But if you
eat something with sugar, as we'll find out, it has a very specific
action in the insular cortex and in other areas of your nervous system
that promotes the desire to eat more. But the key point right now is
to know you've got these two brain areas, the ventromedial
hypothalamus, that's involved in hunger and lack of hunger, sort of an
accelerator and a brake on feeding. And you have this insular cortex
that gets input from your mouth, and cares about chewing and the
consistency of foods and all sorts of interesting things that are just
very tactile. And I think most people think about the touch receptors
on, excuse me, the taste receptors on the tongue. But we often don't
think about the touch or tactile essence of food. And the thing that
comes to mind just now is I've gone to sushi several times, and some
people really like the urchin. I don't like the urchin. There's
something about it that kind of creeps me out about the consistency,
other people love it. So it's highly individual and it's probably
learned, and there's some probably cultural background to this if you
were raised eating urchin. Some people love that consistency or that
touch. So touch has a lot to do with whether or not you want to eat or
not. Now, let's get back to the ventromedial hypothalamus. Sometimes
it makes animals or people want to eat more, sometimes less, so what's
going on there? There's a classic experiment that was done in which
researchers took two rats, and so-called parabiosed them to each
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=665"&gt;Siamese Rats Reveal the Importance of Hormones In Hunger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that meant is that they did a little surgery and they linked
their blood supply so that they were forever physically linked to one
another and could exchange factors in the blood, but their brains were
separate, their mouths were separate, and they essentially did
everything separately except that they were linked to one another. So
they had to walk together and go to the same places in order to do it.
This parabiosis experiment revealed something really important. When
they lesioned the ventromedial hypothalamus in one of the rats that
was connected to the other rat, that rat got very, very fat, just
really obese, huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat. The other one however,
got very thin, it actually lost weight, despite consuming the same
amount of food that it had prior to the other one getting the lesion.
So what does this tell us? This tells us that there's something in the
blood that's being exchanged between the two animals, because it was
their blood supply that was linked. And that tells us that there's
hormone or endocrine signals that are involved in the desire to eat,
and hunger and appetite. And so next, we're going to talk about what
those endocrine signals are, and then I'm going to immediately point
to some entry points that you can use. And you can use these even if
you're not parabiosed to anything. And that can allow you to time your
meal frequency, and predict when you're going to be hungry or not. As
well as a drive up appetite. Believe it or not, there are people out
there who are trying to eat more. Although I think far many more
people are trying to eat less because nowadays, the data just point to
the fact that there is essentially an epidemic of diabetes, type II
diabetes and obesity. And most everyone agrees now, that maintaining a
healthy body weight and body weight composition, is one of the best
paths to longevity and to just feeling very good and actually being
able to think. Cognitive functioning is actually linked to levels of
adipose tissue and so forth. So, let's talk about the endocrine
factors that regulate feeding, hunger and satiety. One of the really
exciting things to emerge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=788"&gt;Neurons That Powerfully Control Hunger by Releasing Specific Hormones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the science of feeding and appetite in the last 20 years, is the
discovery of another brain area. And not just the ventromedial
hypothalamus, but it's an area of the brain called the arcuate
nucleus. And the arcuate nucleus has some really fascinating sets of
neurons that release even more incredible molecules and chemicals into
the blood. And these chemicals act as accelerators on feeding and
appetite, or breaks. And the really cool thing is that you can
actually control these molecules through simple behaviors. And once
you understand what these molecules are, you'll start to understand
why that's the case. And the control points that you have right now in
order to control your appetite in either direction, increase or
decrease. So, first of all, there are set of neurons in this arcuate
nucleus called the PMOC neurons, okay? I don't want to get into what
the acronym stands for, but I'll do it anyway. It's the
Proopiomelanocortin system, okay? So these are PMOC neurons,
Proopiomelanocortin. And if you heard melano, that should tell you it
has something to do with pigmentation in skin cells or in hair cells,
pigmentation of some sort, because of melanin. Last episode, I talked
a little bit about the relationship between light dopamine and
melanin. So you should already be thinking, wait, melano means it
probably has something to do with that system, and indeed it does.
Now, the POMC neurons, make something called Alpha MSH. Melanocyte-
stimulating hormone, Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. If you
don't want to remember any of the other acronyms and terms I've talked
about, this episode so far, do try and remember M-S-H, okay? Mouse,
Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay? MSH reduces appetite and it's a powerful
molecule, all right? So just put that on the shelf, MSH reduces
appetite. Now, there's another population of neurons in the arcuate
nucleus, called the AgRP neurons. And there I'm truly not going to
read you what that stands for 'cause it's related to the mouse strain
it was first identified in, but humans have these cells as well, but
AgRP neurons. The AgRP neurons stimulate eating. And anytime you are
approaching food, or you feel some excitement about food or anxiety,
because some people actually experience a kind of heightened anxiety.
Some people actually get a little bit of a resting tremor before they
eat, even if they don't have any sort of eating disorder. There's kind
of a ramping up of autonomic activity. That's largely due to the
activity of these AgRP neurons. So, the activity in these AgRP neurons
goes way up when animals or people are starved. And I don't mean
starved for long periods of time, but I mean when they haven't eaten
for a while. And the activity of MSH, the release of MSH goes up when
we've eaten. However, there are other things that will stimulate the
release of things like MSH. So, just briefly the experimental
evidence, if you kill AgRP neurons, animals and people stop eating.
There are people of lesions. They just stop eating, they become
anorexic. I know you're familiar with anorexia as a clinical term, but
that's actually a term that's used in the scientific literature about
a pattern of behavior, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=988"&gt;Anorexia &amp;amp; Extreme Overeating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as a clinical term of course. If you were to stimulate the
AgRP neurons, animals or people eat like crazy. They will eat to the
point where they burst. Which just sounds horrible, but it just tells
you this is the accelerator on eating. And yes, it has relationship to
the ventromedial hypothalamus I talked about earlier, but I don't want
to go back there just yet, we will circle back. So Melanocyte-
stimulating hormone, such an interesting hormone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=1017"&gt;Why Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -MSH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing can shut down the desire to eat. The Melanocyte-stimulating
hormone, is released from the medial pituitary. We talked about the
pituitary last time. This is a gland that is very closely positioned
to the hypothalamus. Actually some of the hypothalamus neurons
actually project their neural connections directly into the pituitary,
to release things like gonadotropins and luteinizing hormones, stuff
we talked about last time in reference to testosterone and estrogen.
But MSH is released from the medial portion of the pituitary and it
stimulates the desire to not eat, to cease eating. What's really
interesting, is that Melanocyte-stimulating hormone is activated by
ultraviolet light. And it's not activated by ultraviolet light to the
skin or directly to pituitary, it's activated by ultraviolet light to
the eyes. Now, if you've been watching this podcast or listening to
this podcast for any period of time, or you've heard me on other
podcasts or you follow my Instagram, I am a big fan of this whole
thing of getting morning light in order to synchronize circadian
rhythms, et cetera, avoiding light in the middle of the night. This is
yet another reason why getting ample light, ideally sunlight, but it
could be other sources of UV light to the eyes, stimulates MSH, this
has been shown over and over again. And keeps the desire to eat or
appetite in check, in healthy ranges. This is also why in the spring
and summer months, animals and people eat less. Now, for hibernating
animals it's different, because they bear hibernate, actually. Ashley
bears don't truly hibernate technically, by a scientific criteria they
don't hibernate, but they go into a kind of torpor. The hibernating
animals they don't eat much because they're in boroughs or dens, or
they're just wrapped up in a little ball or whatever it is that
hibernating animals do. So they're of course going to eat far less in
the winter. But that's a unique scenario, we are not hibernating
animals. But humans generally have greater appetite in the cold winter
months. And it's not just because of the holidays and the abundance of
food that we're presenting ourselves with, but when we get a lot of
sun our appetite is reduced or at least it's easier to control. And
that is due in part, because if you're getting ample sunlight to the
eyes, it's converted into a signal for the MSH neurons, the neurons
that release MSH, excuse me these PMOC neurons release MSH. And then
MSH can bind its receptors, and can keep the break on appetite in
check. So the takeaway tool from this, is make sure you're getting
enough light not just in the morning, but throughout the day. And yes,
it has to be light to your eyes. And blasting your eyes with sunlight
or artificial light to the point where it's damaging or painful, won't
accelerate or improve this process. It's about getting photons,
ultraviolet light to the eyes consistently throughout the day. That's
best accomplished by not wearing sunglasses provided you can do that
safely. And if you don't have access to enough sunlight, then you can
do this with artificial light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=1203"&gt;Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan &amp;amp; Priapism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also points again to our old friends, the blue blockers. Many
people know I'm not a huge fan of blue blockers especially not during
the daytime, because they block a lot of the UV and shorter wavelength
light that you want and need to create alertness, but also to create
release of MSH from the medial pituitary. Now there are people out
there, subcultures, that actually inject MSH. That are taking MSH or
things similar to it. I am not suggesting people do that. But there
are three main consequences of doing that. First of all, it reduces
appetite, no surprise there. And they're actually using it as a
dieting drug. This is kind of in the underground. I don't know what
the legal status is. And again, I'm not promoting that people do it.
Two, it makes them very, very tan, which makes sense, right?
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. And the third is, it purportedly,
never tried it, purportedly sends libido through the roof, to the
point where it's actually distracting for other activities. It
actually can create priapism, which is a kind of chronic erection in
males to the point where it actually can be physically damaging to the
genitalia. So this is a drug, I don't know whether or not it's call it
a drug. It's a substance that one can regulate with healthy levels,
with sunlight and perhaps artificial UV light. I have not heard much
about treatments for obesity involving getting ample sunlight or
getting ample UV light, but to me, the logic is just very clear. And
so if you're pursuing those avenues, you certainly should talk to your
physician but you might want to think about how some of those logic
hangs together. Absolutely fascinating hormone, I think most people
aren't aware of it. And the subcultures that are aware of it are using
it for two very particular end points, and they're using it at super
physiological levels. That's enough about that 'cause I really don't
know. I've talked to a few people in research. Believe it or not for
this podcast, I reached out to a few people and asked whether or not
the these are side effects in air quotes. I've heard about are true,
and indeed they're true. But again, that's super physiological,
controlling MSH, it's actually Alpha MSH levels through viewing
ultraviolet light seems like an interesting and mechanistically
logical thing to do, if your goal is to keep appetite in check. So MSH
inhibits hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=1350"&gt;Ghrelin: A Hormone That Determines When You Get Hungry, &amp;amp; That You Can Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let's talk about a hormone peptide that activates hunger. And
this is a really interesting one because it relates to when you get
hungry, in addition to the fact that you get hungry at all. And it's
called ghrelin, it's spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin is released
actually from the GI tract. And its main role is to increase your
desire to eat. And it does that through a variety of mechanisms. Part
of that is to stimulate some of the brain areas, the actual neurons,
that make you want to eat. In addition, it creates food anticipatory
signals within your nervous systems. So you start thinking about the
things that you happen to like to eat at that particular time of day.
And this is fascinating. Ghrelin is sort of like a clock, a hormonal
clock that makes you want to eat at particular times. Now, the signal
for ghrelin is reduced glucose levels in the blood. We're going to
talk a lot today about glucose and insulin, ways to manage glucose and
insulin. But for now the simple version of this, is you normally want
your glucose to be in a kind of modest range, and I'll explain what
range is in a little bit. But if it drops too low, ghrelin is secreted
from your gut. It activates neurons in your brain at various locations
including the PMOC neurons, and the other neurons of the wingin' it.
It also activates the VMH in particular ways. And it might even
activate some of these neurons that are in the periphery in your mouth
that actually make you salivate and want to eat, right? Now, we all
know about the famous Pavlovian, experiments of Pavlov's dogs. You
know, they start salivating to the bell. After the bell was presented
with food, you remove the food, and then just the bell can stimulate
the salivation. We become Pavlovian at times. But rarely is it ever
discussed what the neural pathways for that are. And it turns out that
these hormones that are secreted from the gut can stimulate the
neurons to create a sensation and a desire for certain foods at
certain times of day. You've done this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=1480"&gt;Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not the Other Way Around&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are somebody who eats breakfast at more or less the same time
each day, let's say 8:00 AM plus or minus 20 minutes. And then you eat
lunch 12:30 plus or minus 20 minutes. Or let's say you're somebody
like me who typically skips breakfast, and just eats lunch usually
around 11:30 or 12 or something like that. Your ghrelin secretion will
start to match when you typically eat. And it does that. And it's able
to override the low levels of glucose in your bloodstream, because the
ghrelin system also gets input from a clock in your liver that is
linked to the clock in your hypothalamus, in your brain. And what this
means is, if you eat at regular meal times, you'll start to get hungry
a few minutes before those meals times. If you've ever wondered why
your stomach kind of starts to growl because it's a particular time of
day, and you're like, Oh I must want to eat, well, that's ghrelin. And
for those of you that don't know why your stomach growls, I'll also
tell you that today. It's actually really interesting. It not at all
what you expect, and it's not just the gurgling of liquids in your
stomach. That's not what it is. It's actually a muscular phenomenon.
So, ghrelin is secreted as a food anticipatory signal, to get you
motivated to go eat at regular times. So, nowadays there's a lot of
interest in intermittent fasting. There's also a lot of interest in
just what meal plans and schedules and what to eat in general, in
order to maximize one's health and wellbeing. And people have all
sorts of cosmetic reasons and brain reasons and metabolic reasons for
wanting to control this kind of stuff. So let's make it really simple
by first looking at the extremes. Some people need to eat every two or
three hours. They feel this, "I need to eat every two or three hours,"
or else their blood sugar drops. In general, blood sugar doesn't drop
so low, that they truly need to eat in order to alleviate a blood
sugar issue. Although sometimes that can happen. Some people are truly
hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. But most people as the blood sugar
starts to head down towards the low-ish ranges, ghrelin is secreted.
And so for those people not eating on the clock, it's very disruptive
to them because it activates these neurons in the brain. For people
who eat once a day or twice a day, or tend to shift their meals, you
know, and they might eat a lot but during a limited so-called feeding
window, it's kind of interesting humans now eat and talk about foods
in ways that for years I used to hear about in classes, in courses,
and research lectures about feeding animals, you know, restricted
feeding windows. And we owe a great deal of gratitude to Satchin
Panda,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=1640"&gt;Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating &amp;amp; Intermittent(ish) Fasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who was a colleague of mine when my lab was in San Diego at the Salk
Institute, who really is one of the pioneers of this restricted
feeding window work and has done a beautiful work. He has a book
that's excellent called 'The Circadian Code' that I highly recommend.
And he's done a lot of important work on neurons in the retina, that
control circadian timing, but also the relationship between feeding
windows and health. And he's sort of among the major proponents I
should say, of circadian eating, that means eating during the daytime,
not at night or intermittent fasting, restricting feeding windows to
anywhere from four to six to eight hours. I'll use myself as an
example of the transition from regular feeding schedule to a more
intermittent-ish fasting, although I don't really fall into true
intermittent fasting. So I was one of these people that just got so
accustomed to waking up and eating about an hour after I woke up. That
to go from eating every three or four hours to eating twice a day,
lunch and dinner, maybe a couple of snacks in the afternoon or
something. At first it was excruciating. I remember thinking like,
this is really brutal pushing out feeding. I didn't think I could
exercise unless I had eaten first. We now know that during most all
forms of exercise unless you're really focused on optimal performance
like you've got to hit key lifts or you have to sprint at your maximum
speed. And maybe even then that you can exercise faster just fine,
because you're mainly relying on sources like glycogen from the liver,
some undigested food sometimes, as gross as that may seem it's true,
as well as body fat if the exercise about is extremely long. But what
that means is that if you suddenly go from eating on a very regular
schedule to skipping a meal, or pushing your meal timing out or
shifting at all, you're going to have ghrelin in your system. And that
ghrelin is going to stimulate the desire to eat by acting at the level
of your brain. And it is indeed at that point, just mental. When we
hear about just mental, just physical, it's really kind of the same
thing 'cause it's all chemicals, brain and body. But it's the
stimulation of neurons that anticipate feeding. You're stimulating the
arcuate nucleus neurons that make you want to eat those AgRP neurons.
So ghrelin stimulates the AgRP neurons, which makes you want to eat.
So what can you do with this? What this means is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=1775"&gt;How To Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: The 45min Per Day Rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you want to start shifting your feeding schedule to one where
you're not eating quite as frequently, and there are some advantages
to that that aren't just in the biochemistry and health related, you
know, cellar health related things. But some of them include not
having to think about or buy food, right? You actually don't have to
think about food all day if you're not eating so often. The other is,
it gives you a far more social flexibility, right? You can go to a
noon meeting if you have to or you can go out to dinner at a
particular time. And you know, I guess it makes it kind of tough if
you want to meet somebody for breakfast, 'cause then you're the dork
who's just like sipping black coffee and like refusing everything. But
anyway, I've been that dork. So it's one of those things you just kind
of work with. But the fact of the matter is, ghrelin secretion,
because of its relationship to the nervous system, can be shifted by
about 45 minutes per day. Now, it's going to vary. Some of you have
more so-called willpower, you know. But if you really want to just
start pushing that first meal out or shifting in any direction, some
people might want to eat in the early part of the day and not in the
evening. Trying to shift the mealtimes out the spacing by about 45
minutes, is what the neural circuits that link the ghrelin system to
the neural circuits that control feeding, really can handle because
it's a form of neuroplasticity. And so what this would look like is,
if you normally you eat breakfast at eight o'clock plus or minus 20
minutes, and you want to start eating your first meal at noon you
would take maybe four or five days and just start pushing the meal out
by about 45 minutes to an hour each day. So it's not quite as painful.
Or you can just take the plunge and just do it all at once. I have a
colleague who was a neurosurgeon at Stanford, came up through my lab,
he's now at Neuralink, and he has a great practice. He keeps his
ghrelin system at random. What he does is he skips one meal per day
and he makes his external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes he
skips breakfast, sometimes he skips lunch, sometimes he skips dinner,
he just skips one of the three major meals per day. And in doing that,
the ghrelin system has always kind of kept off kilter. And it probably
also allows him to have a lot of neural flexibility, what we call top-
down control. Just the knowledge, Oh, you know the hunger I'm feeling
isn't necessarily hypoglycemia. And in his case, it's almost certainly
not. And therefore what I'm feeling here is an activation of these
AgRP neurons, and therefore I can push my meal schedule around however
I want. Now, I should mention that top-down mechanisms are powerful.
Belief, motivation, these things can really shift neural circuits.
We're going to talk more about that a little bit later. But there are
also people who are genuinely hypoglycemic and they need to take
really good control of their blood sugar levels and try and keep them
stable. And so of course, you want to do what's medically safe for
you. I'm not at all recommending that people that suffer from
hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt their blood sugar patterns in any
direction, that wouldn't be healthy. But for most people out there who
have reasonable blood glucose levels, it's kind of interesting and
kind of fun to play with these parameters in order to optimize what
you want to do. And sometimes that might change across the year with
schedules. Many find great benefit in having flexibility over when
they eat. Regularity of eating equals regularity of ghrelin secretion
equals regularity of activity of these AgRP neurons, meaning you'll be
hungry at very regular intervals. So that's something that you can
work with, it's grounded in deep mechanism of hormone and neural
systems, and there's a lot of modern research to support what I just
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=1982"&gt;CCK (Cholecystokinin): A Hormone In Your Gut That Says “No Mas!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if MSH inhibits feeding, makes us want to eat less and ghrelin
makes us want to eat more, there's another hormone called CCK,
Cholecystokinin, that is potent in reducing our levels of hunger. Now,
I learned about CCK back when I was an undergraduate. So, well over 20
years ago, when it was first discovered. And there was a lot of
excitement about CCK at that point as a diet drug. You know, anytime
there's a molecule or a chemical discovered in the brain or body that
can suppress feeding, the diet industry just goes wild and they think,
this is going to be the thing that's going to allow people to move
from being obese to losing all sorts of unhealthy weight, et cetera. A
similar phenomenon was observed with leptin. Leptin is a hormone
that's made by body fat that signals to the brain when there's a lot
of body fat, and in animals injections of leptin can make fat animals
thin. They lose a lot of adipose or fat. In humans, it didn't work out
that way. It just the studies were done and leptin was successful in
treating a certain rare form of diabetes, but it really wasn't very
potent as an anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK has been looked at as
an obesity drug, something to reduce obesity. But it had some pretty
unhappy side effects actually caused some pretty serious side effects.
Now that's as drug. However, CCK when released at normal levels by
your gut has a powerful effect in suppressing appetite for a period of
time. And there are healthy and direct ways to activate CCK. Now, CCK
is in the GI tract, it's released from the GI tract. And it's release
is governed by two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=2095"&gt;Eating For Amino Acids, Fatty Acids &amp;amp; Sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is a subset of very specialized neurons that detect what's in the
gut, the specific contents of the gut. And by certain elements of the
mucosa, of the mucus lining of the gut and the gut microbiome. So
what's really interesting, is that CCK is stimulated by fatty acids
and particular fatty acids that we'll talk about. Amino acids, and
particular amino acids that we'll talk about, as well as by sugar.
Now, let's put sugar on the shelf for a moment. We're going to talk a
lot about sugar because if CCK inhibits appetite and reduces feeding,
and it can be triggered by fatty acids, amino acids, or sugars, then
you might say, well, then in eating a lot of sugars should make us not
want to eat more, but we all know that eating sugar makes us want to
eat far more. That's the role of a lot of sugars. And that has to do
with a separate mechanism we'll talk about today. So, which fatty
acids in the gut stimulate the release of CCK? It turns out it's the
omega-3 fatty acids, the ones that come from algae or krill or fish
oil. I talked about this in the episode on nutrition and some of the
things related to the gut microbiome. And I'm going to revisit that
now. Omega-3 fatty acids and Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
from food or from supplements, stimulate the release of CCK which then
reduces, or at least blunts appetite. And I'm not talking about
blunting appetite to anorexic levels where you don't want to eat at
all. I'm talking about regulating appetite to the point where animals
and people don't over-consume. So it's keeping appetite at a healthy
level. The other thing that stimulates CCK that I mentioned, are amino
acids. So when we eat, we have the ability to break down different
macronutrients, you know, carbohydrates, fats or proteins, into sugars
and glucose, that then we can convert to ATP and all that stuff from a
Krebs cycle from high school. We're not going to go into that today,
that's for a future episode. But amino acids are one of the things
that we are eating for. Amino acids both can be used as energy through
a process called gluconeogenesis, of converting proteins into energy.
Or those amino acids can be broken down and then rebuilt into things
like preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue as well as other
forms of cellar repair. They're involved in all sorts of things
related to protein synthesis. What does this mean? If we eat the
proper amino acids at the proper levels, if we ingest omega-3's and
CLA's, Conjugated linoleic acids at the proper levels, or get them
from supplements, there's a blunting of appetite. Appetite is kept
clamped and we don't become hyperphagic. We don't overeat. We tend to
eat within healthy or normal ranges. So this is very important,
because most people don't understand that when we're eating, we are
basically fat foraging and amino acid foraging. And there are several
studies now have shown, that people and animals will essentially eat
until they feel they've consumed enough omega-3's, omega-6's, CLA's,
and certain amino acids. In other words, even if it's not conscious,
we are eating until we trigger the activation of CCK. Now, there are
other reasons why we shut down eating too. Are literally, the volume
of food in our gut can be large, and we can feel very distended.
That's the physical reason obviously. There are other reasons, maybe
we just have top-down control. We have knowledge that this is the end
of the meal and we stop 'cause we have to go back to work or to a
meeting, or we tell ourselves we've had enough. But at a subconscious
level, the gut is informing the brain via CCK and other mechanisms
when we've ingested enough of what we need. And these omega-3's and
CLA's and certain amino acids are vital for sending out that signal
that we've had enough. Now, which amino acids is actually really
interesting? We have essential amino acids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=2345"&gt;L-Glutamine: Stimulates the Immune System &amp;amp; Reduces Sugar Cravings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we have non-essential amino acids. Among the essential amino
acids, there's one in particular that can trigger the release of CCK
very potently, and that's glutamine. Glutamine is a very interesting
amino acid. First of all, it's been shown in a few studies to play a
role in bolstering the immune system. It can increase the number of
killer cells in the immune system. It is consumed but in supplement
form. You know, people can take it. You know, a teaspoon of glutamine
or some people take glutamine throughout the day, if they're really
into it or for whatever reason, they think they're battling off an
infection or something of that sort. Glutamine can also of course be
derived from foods. And you can just put into the Internet, do an
Internet search and find out what foods are rich with glutamine. Some
of the ones that I'm aware of off the top of my head are like cottage
cheese, and things of that sort. But other foods have glutamine as
well. Once a threshold level of glutamine and other essential amino
acids are reached, once the threshold level of these Alpha-3, excuse
me, Omega-3 fatty acids and CLA's are reached, CCK is released, and it
helps reduce the activity of those AgRP neurons that promote feeding.
So as you can see, feeding is an interplay between brain and body. And
it's some of the micronutrients and even the breakdown of particular
nutrients, that's putting the accelerator or the brake on the feeding
process. It's not just one thing. So from an actionable standpoint,
you, we should probably all be trying to get our omega-3, Omega-6
ratios correct anyway, because they are antidepressant. I talked about
the peer reviewed studies on that. They are healthy for the gut
microbiome, and we should be seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether or not you decide to supplement with glutamine or not, is up
to you. One of the reasons why one might want to do that, and again,
you should always check with a doctor, especially if you have any
predisposition to cancers or you have cancer, many cancers and tumors
like glutamine, so that's something to note. But one reason why you
might want to supplement with glutamine or consider eating foods that
are rich in glutamine, isn't just to keep your appetite in healthy
ranges, but as well, glutamine can actually reduce sugar cravings. So
this is very interesting. I have a friend, he's an absolute chocolate,
sweets addict. He's a grown adult, but he eats candy and chocolate as
if he was like a 14 year old kid hanging out at the local convenience
store. It's really incredible. And he has probably a sugar addiction,
but he's very aware of this and he's managed to kick all other
addictions. So, for whatever reason, it stimulates his brain and body
in the ways that make him want more, but he hates this. It's actually
quite frustrating for him. He's somebody who cares a lot about his
health. He took the approach that I know many other people have who
know about this role of glutamine, of taking a teaspoon or a couple of
teaspoons of glutamine several times throughout the day or anytime he
craves sugar. And indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
Some people who are really on the kind of ketogenic front, will mix it
with a little bit of half and half and down that, and because I guess
it makes it taste better, it's a little bit chalky. So, glutamine has
some very interesting properties. But I think for most people that
aren't suffering from adverse levels of craving, making sure you're
getting the right omega-3's that can come from a variety of sources,
check out the episode we did on nutrition if you want to learn more
about that. And CLA's, and making sure that you're getting enough
glutamine is going to be important for making sure that the CCK signal
gets through. The one thing I do want to mention about glutamine, it's
a minor effect, but it alone can have a small increase, excuse me, it
alone can increase blood sugar. It's not a huge increase in blood
glucose. But because the gut takes proteins and breaks them down into
these amino acids, and essentially looking for glutamine and things
like it, other essential amino acids as well. When you ingest
glutamine or branch chain amino acids, there is a small but real
increase in blood glucose. And that's because they are essentially
food. And there I'm talking about the supplemental version. So, just
know glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics
should know that. It can reduce sugar cravings. And just know that
what your gut is doing at a core level is it's forging, it's waiting,
and it's trying to assess levels of omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, and glutamine, and other essential amino acids. You are
essentially trying to eat to get these nutrients and then a signal can
be deployed up to your brain, that you're not really interested in
eating that much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=2622"&gt;Things To Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa &amp;amp; Nutrient Sensing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever preparing an episode for this podcast I'm always faced with a
particular challenge, which is, how many tools should I offer that
involve doing something new? You know, a new behavior, a new exercise,
supplement, something, things of that sort. And how many should be
related to not doing things, avoiding things. It's never really fun to
talk about all the things that we're supposed to avoid, but some of
them are so powerful in light of the mechanisms of a given topic that
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention them. So now you understand how
hormones, and peptides like CCK and ghrelin impact appetite. There's
one particular aspect of food that can powerfully impact CCK. And I
think most people, I'm guessing 99.9% of people out there are not
aware of this. And it has to do with highly processed foods. There's a
lot of reasons why one would want to avoid highly processed foods. In
fact, if you're interested in that topic and the history of whole
foods, transitioning to highly processed foods in this country, I
highly recommend you listen to a YouTube video by Dr. Robert Lustig,
he's at university of California, San Francisco. It's very easy to
find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig, it was a talk hosted by Stanford.
Gives a a beautiful description of the history of this, and why the
food industry started packing in additional sugars and salts, and
turning foods into commodities, it's really fascinating. It has no
conspiracy theory is just all scientific facts. It's really a
wonderful lecture. It has millions of views, it should be very easy to
find. We can provide a link to that, and we will. There's another
reason to avoid highly processed foods however, and that has to do
with what's called emulsifiers. Now, many of you are familiar with
emulsifiers, even though you don't know it. When you put detergent in
the laundry that contains emulsifiers, the goal of that detergent is
to bring together fatty molecules with water molecules and be able to
dissociate them and break them up to get the stains out of clothes and
things of that sort. There are a lot of emulsifiers put into processed
foods. And those emulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions to occur
that extends the shelf life of those foods. So it's like candy bars
and cereals, and all sorts of things that are in processed foods. The
worst of which are the typical kind of pastries that you see at the
convenience store. But this extends into chips of various kinds and
even some meats of various kinds, they pack this stuff into meats.
They have names like soy lecithin and other things. Why are
emulsifiers bad? Okay, there are a lot of reasons why they're bad, but
the reason why they're bad for the mechanisms that we've been talking
about today, is that when you ingest those foods, you're bringing
those emulsifiers into your gut. And those emulsifiers strip away the
mucosal lining of the gut, and they actually cause the neurons that
innervate the gut, that extend those little processes we call axons
into the gut, to retract deeper into the gut. And as a consequence,
you're ingesting a bunch of food and the signals like CCK never get
deployed. The signals that actually shut down hunger are never
actually triggered. And so, as a consequence you want to eat far more
of these highly processed foods. In addition, if you then go from
eating a highly processed food to non highly processed foods, you're
not able to measure the amounts of amino acids, sugars, and fatty
acids in those foods as accurately. You've actually done structural
damage at a micro level, but structural level damage, excuse me, to
the mucosal lining of the gut. Now, this can all be repaired if you
stay away from highly processed foods for some period of time. But the
negative effects of these emulsifiers are quite real. So, to make it
really clean and simple, emulsifiers from highly processed foods are
limiting your guts ability to detect what's in the foods you eat and
therefore to deploy the satiety signals, the signals that shut down
hunger. In addition to that, there's a parallel mechanism at play,
that I talked about in a previous episode but I'll remind you again,
that you have neurons in your gut that are sensing sugar, and are
sending a subconscious signal up to the brain via the vagus nerve. And
those neurons trigger the release of dopamine, which makes you crave
more of that food. So now you've got parallel signals making you want
to eat more sugar, making you unaware of how much sugar you've eaten,
and that are disrupting the inputs to the nervous system that signal
to the rest of your brain and body that you've obtained enough fatty
acids and you've obtained enough amino acids. So these highly
processed foods are really terrible. And you know, I'm not out here to
say, you know, never enjoy a processed food of any kind, I'd be a
hypocrite 'cause I do eat processed foods from time to time. Although
the ones that I tend to eat, I try and make of the healthier variety.
But eating whole foods has tremendous value and eating highly
processed food has tremendous negative impact on the gut and on the
gut brain axis. And so, recently there was a paper that came out in
Cell, Cell Press journal, it's kind of the apex of Cell journals,
which is a phenomenal. This paper showed that, ingesting highly
processed food leads to more intake of not just highly processed foods
but other types of food in general. There was kind of an overeating
compensation generally across foods for people that consume these
highly processed foods. And there are a lot of other reasons to avoid
highly processed foods. So again, I don't like to focus too much on
the do nots, I like to arm you with tools to do. But I think this
visual of certain foods and these emulsifiers actually stripping away
some of the critical lining of your gut and disrupting the hormone
signaling to the brain controlling feeding, is important enough and
cryptic enough, meaning it hasn't been talked about, it works at a
subconscious level, and that it's important that people are aware of
it so they can make decisions about what they do want to eat or not
want to eat for themselves. Before moving on, I just want to say one
more thing about highly processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=2972"&gt;“A Calorie Is NOT A Calorie” After All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an absolutely beautiful study done by my colleague, Chris
Gardner at Stanford, exploring whether or not certain diets were
better than others. They looked at vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, I
don't know if they looked at all meat or not, but they looked at the
different forms of diets, intermittent fasting, et cetera. And they
essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever
one they followed, was equivalent to the others. Provided that they
followed it, they lost the equivalent amount of weight. There really
wasn't a strong effect of the food type or the pattern of eating, et
cetera. However, in a study like that, adherence is very high because
people are a part of a study. And for many people, the ability to
adhere to a certain eating plan is one of the most, if not the most
powerful determinants of whether or not a given diet meaning
nutritional plan works. Now, this thing about highly processed foods
however, is really diabolical. Because it truly says, and I think the
recent data in cell metabolism and other journals really proves that,
a calorie is not a calorie. That's absolutely absurd because of these
emulsifiers and the contents of these highly processed foods. In fact,
the data in humans points to this. So what they did is they took in-
patient adults, so they had total control over their food intake. And
they received either ultra processed or unprocessed diets for 14 days,
as a short study. The diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat,
fiber, and macronutrients. So everything else was matched. Just
processed or non-processed is the major variable. And basically what
they found, is that the people who are eating the processed food diet
happened to eat much more, right? This was after this period of
putting them on either diet and clamping for all other variables. Then
they would eat much more, and the body weight changes were much more.
And those body weight changes, were such that they couldn't be
accounted for by just increased calories. So, the bottom line is that
highly processed foods are just bad for you. They increase weight
gain. They disrupt the lining of your gut in a way that disrupts
things like CCK and proper satiety signals. And they contain a bunch
of things, in particular sugars, but other things as well, that
disrupt not just the hormonal systems but also the neural systems that
control the desire to eat after the diet is done. So there's just so
many reasons why these highly processed foods are terrible, and they
can explain a lot of the ill health effects that we've seen in the
last 50 years not just in the United States, but all over the world.
That enormous increase in diabetes, juvenile diabetes. It's just
remarkable how far down the path of diet we've gone. And it's clear,
it's almost a smoking gun what the cause of this is. If you'd like to
learn more about that please refer to the Lustig lecture. He also
spells out why non-processed foods is far more economical in terms of
just at the level of the household or individual as well as at the
societal level. Really interesting stuff, I highly recommend you check
it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=3156"&gt;Insulin &amp;amp; Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, &amp;amp; Hypogylcemia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now let's move on to some other hormones that regulate hunger and
satiety, in particular insulin. Now, you've probably heard of insulin
before. Insulin is the thing that's lacking in type I diabetics,
that's why they have to inject insulin whenever they eat. The reason
they have to do that, is because when they eat their foods are broken
down into glucose. And in order to shuttle glucose to the appropriate
tissues in the body, and also to keep glucose levels in check, you
need insulin. So the simplest way to think about insulin and glucose
is that when you eat, that food is broken down into sugars, that's
true whether or not it's fats or it's sugars, or eventually if it's
proteins, they are oxidized into fuels as we say. And those fuels can
be used as the name fuel implies into energy, they're eventually made
into ATP. There's a bunch of biochemical steps there we're not going
to go into today, but that's essentially how it works. You break down
food into glucose. Now, if you're ketogenic, we'll talk about that in
a little bit. But in general, you eat, food is turned into glucose.
Your blood sugar needs to be kept in a particular range. Hypoglycemic
means too low, hyperglycemic means too high. And what they called
euglycemic E-U, glycemic, is the healthy range. Now, what those
healthy ranges are, in general the healthy range, the euglycemic
range, is about 70 to a hundred nanograms per deciliter. But most of
you aren't walking around with a glucose monitor. Some of you are, but
most of you are not. The more important question for us to address
right now, is why is it important that glucose be kept at a particular
level? Once you understand that, keeping glucose in check starts to
have a rationale behind it and the ways to do that start to make a lot
more sense. So the reason is, if glucose levels get too high because
of the way that our cells in particular neurons, interact with
glucose, high levels of glucose can damage neurons. It can actually
kill them. You can start getting what are called peripheral, excuse
me, neuropathies. One of the symptoms of some forms of diabetes is
that people start losing the sensation of touch in their fingers or
their hands or their feet, and they can start going blind. There's
diabetic retinopathies. So it's very important, that insulin manage
your glucose levels. Now, there's also type II diabetes where there's
insulin secreted from the pancreas, but people are insulin
insensitive. There's a disruption in the receptors and insulin
insensitivity isn't quite the same as having no insulin at all, but it
parallels some of the same mechanisms. Now, type I diabetes is often
picked up because someone has a sudden weight loss, because they're
not processing blood sugar the same way they were before. Type II
diabetes is often, although not always associated with being
overweight and with obesity. Both of them are challenging conditions.
Type II diabetes almost always can be managed by managing one's
weight. And of course there are prescription drugs and supplements
that can help manage those. We're going to talk about all of that. But
for most people that don't have diabetes, the important thing is to
manage glucose, to keep it in that euglycemic range. And there are a
number of different ways to do that. Some of them are behavioral, some
of them are diet based, and some of them are based on supplements or
prescription drugs. So let's talk about those now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=3372"&gt;The Order Your Eat Foods Matters: Managing Your Blood Glucose &amp;amp; Glucagon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you eat, and in particular if you eat carbohydrates, blood
glucose goes up. If you eat fats, blood glucose goes up to a far less
degree. And if you eat proteins, depending on the protein, it will
eventually be broken down for fuel or assembled into amino acid chains
for protein synthesis and repair of other tissues and bodily
functions. But glucose goes up and then is kept in range. When you are
hungry, you secrete a different hormone and that's called glucagon.
And glucagon's main role, is to pull stores of energy out of the liver
and the muscles. And once those are depleted, you'll eventually tap
into body fat, okay? So, and this is for people that have a typical
blood glucose range, so that 70 to 100 euglycemic range. So, the two
kind of push and pull systems that we're going to think about now to
keep this simple, is that you have the insulin system managing
glucose, and you've got the glucagon system pulling energy out of your
liver and muscles for immediate fuel. And eventually you'll pull fuel
out of body fat if you've been active for a very long time and all
your glycogen stores are depleted or close to depleted. So what does
this all mean? There's a lot of important biochemistry and a lot of
important cellar processes involved in whether or not your anabolic or
catabolic. Whether or not you're breaking things down or building
things up. Let's talk about feeding in a simpler way, however. And
let's weave the tools to manage blood glucose, to keep it in check, as
we do that. So, let's say you had a meal and that meal consisted of
rice, a carbohydrate, some meat or fish, let's say a piece of salmon,
and some vegetable, some fibrous vegetable like asparagus or cabbage
or something like that. If you were to eat all of that at once, you
know, you take a bite of one, a bite of the other, you're going to mix
it up. You know, one of these, it all ends up in the same place kind
of people, mix it all up. Then you'll experience an increase in
insulin and increase in blood glucose that's moderately fast. It's
going to increase pretty quickly. What's remarkable, is that the order
that you consume each macro-nutrient has a pretty profound influence
on the rate of insulin and glucose secretion into the blood and how
quickly those levels rise. So if you will make it really simple. If
you were to eat the rice first, your glucose would rise in a sharp
spike, especially if it doesn't contain any fats to slow the
absorption. Now, that might be good if you're very hungry and you want
to get an increase in glucose. In fact, this is the reason why you're
often served bread before meals, because it is... And sometimes it's
bread and butter, or chips before meals or appetizers, are designed to
get your blood glucose going up high because big steep increases in
blood glucose tend to promote the desire to consume more glucose. And
this also relates to the dopamine system and the way that something
tasty in the mouth and sugar in the gut and fats and sugars in the
mouth, trigger the activation of a lot of systems in the brain and
body to consume more of whatever you have or whatever is available to
you. So, the basic idea is that eating carbohydrates and/or fats early
in a meal will give a steep rise in blood glucose. However, if you
were to eat the fibrous thing first, so a lot of chewing, but not a
big rise in blood glucose because in general there's... Unless it's
laid in with sugar. Or something we're just talking about some
vegetable, fibrous vegetable, that will actually blunt the release of
glucose until you eat the fish and the rice. But believe it or not it
will actually blunt the glucose increase that the rice would cause.
Now, I'm not talking about neurotically eating each macro-nutrient
separately in sequence. I'm just trying to give you a picture of
what's happening ordinarily. So what this means is, if you feel a lot
of food related anxiety, or you feel you're one of these people that
you can kind of sense like your blood sugar increasing very quickly, a
lot of people can sense this, some people can't, has a lot to do with
how well they manage their blood sugar as well as some of the
psychological factors. And yes, their family and historical reasons,
you know, I've got friends who had a lot of siblings, and when they
sit down to eat they have to really suppress the desire to not beat up
everyone else at the table and take all the food. It's sort of like
not... It's hard for them to understand that there's plenty to go
around, because of their upbringing. So there are psychological top-
down effects. A lot of the psychology around food is geared towards
getting people to be relaxed when they eat and these sorts of things.
But these blood sugar effects are real just cellar and basic
biochemistry of how the body manages sugars ingested into the blood.
So what does this all mean? It means that if you want a steep increase
in glucose, you are very, very hungry, then you should eat the
carbohydrate laid in food first, or you should eat a bunch of
macronutrients combined. So that would be like the hamburger or the
sandwich, the bread, the whatever's in that sandwich altogether,
usually that's protein and vegetables as well. If you want to have a
more modest increase in glucose or you want to blunt the increase in
glucose, then have the, at least some of the fibrous thing first, and
then the protein and then the carbohydrate. You will notice that your
blood glucose will rise more steadily, and that you'll achieve satiety
earlier in the meal. Or at least you won't get this huge peak at sort
of the Thanksgiving meal effect. Some of you are international, so if
you don't celebrate Thanksgiving is a time of year where... It used to
be the one-time a year or two times a year where Americans would give
themselves permission to eat enormous meals. Now that seems to happen
a lot more often. But there is this effect of you're full and yet
you're hungry for more, that's because your blood glucose has gone
through the roof and it's triggered a number of other mechanisms.
There's also usually a lot of alcohol consumption, and alcohol itself
because it's a sugar will increase blood glucose very, very sharply.
It depends on the alcohol, some alcohols have more sugar than others.
But basically what you're trying to avoid are steep increases in blood
sugar. And the order that you eat foods has an enormous impact on
that. The other thing that has an enormous impact on how long and
shallow, or how steep that curve of glucose is, depends on on whether
or not you recently were moving, are moving or start moving after you
eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=3760"&gt;Movement, Exercise &amp;amp; GLUT-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it turns out that your blood glucose levels can be modulated very,
very powerfully by movement. If you did any kind of intense exercise,
or even just walking or jogging, or cycling anything before you eat
your blood glucose levels will be dampened somewhat. And that has to
do with the release of something called, some people call it GLUT4,
which sounds like glutton. Other people call it GLUT4. These are
things that are involved in shuttling glucose to particular cells in
the body, namely toward muscle and glycogen stores and away from body
fat stores. It has to do with sequestering of glucose from the blood.
The point is that, if you're somebody who struggles with blood sugar
regulation, in addition to getting your body weight in a healthy
range, doing all the other sorts of things that you should be doing,
the key thing is to try and get some movement, sometime as circuit
meal. Now, very few people can actually eat and walk at the same time,
although I do it all the time. Not because I'm trying to regulate my
blood sugar but just 'cause I tend to be busy. I eat and drive,
[mumbles] busy. Busy if I'm not giving this podcast, or if sleeping,
I'm eating, but except the early part of the day when I fast. But the
bottom line here is that, if you, for instance take a 30 minute walk
after a meal, your blood glucose will be blunted in ways that are
beneficial. If you have exercised in the recent hours before a meal,
that can be beneficial. The order that you consume foods is
beneficial. And there are a few things that you can consume that can
also adjust blood glucose levels. So let's talk about those, but I
thought it was important to really tamp down that it's not just what
you eat, we talked about that before, but also the order that you eat
those things, believe it or not, whether or not you combine macro-
nutrients, carbohydrates, proteins and fats and fibrous vegetables.
And whether or not you've moved recently. The higher intensity the
movement, the greater the GLUT4 increase, and the more that the blood
glucose will be blunted and you'll shuttle more of that to glycogen
and muscle stores. And even just moving after a meal, even just a calm
easy walk, can really adjust the ways in which blood sugar regulated
for the better. I don't want to perseverate on this processed foods,
hidden sugars thing too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=3890"&gt;Why Sugar Stimulates Your Appetite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But understanding now a little bit about how insulin and glucose work,
you can probably imagine why hidden sugars are such an attractive
thing from the standpoint of processed food manufacturers. Because if
they can put sugar in that you can't even taste, that sugar is going
to amplify the amount of glucose, it's going to increase the rate of
glucose increase into your bloodstream and it's going to promote more
feeding. So in that case, you're really being tricked. It's not that
you're actually reaching for the additional appetizer and your blood
glucose is going up. The food that you ate is actually increasing your
appetite as you eat it. It's a positive feedback loop. So don't want
to demonize those any more than I already have, but you should be
aware that these things are happening at the level of your bloodstream
and brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=3940"&gt;Keeping Blood Sugar Stable With Specific Exercises, The Power Of Insulin Sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I'd like to address for a moment, is this notion of
stable blood sugar versus lay bile blood sugar or unstable blood
sugar. Some people just have stable blood sugar. They can go long
periods of time without eating and feel fine. Other people get really
shaky, really jittery, and/or when they do eat, they feel really keyed
up. Sometimes they'll even sweat. Sometimes their vision will go
blurry. And some of that can actually be because they've become
hyperglycemic. And those effects that you experience when you are
hyperglycemic are the early warning signs of the kinds of things that
damage neurons and lead to the really terrible stuff they talked about
before like peripheral neuropathies. Now, it takes some time for those
things to occur, those neuropathies to occur. But whether or not your
blood sugar is all over the place or whether or not stable, can be
impacted by a number of things. One of those things is exercise. So
these days there's a lot of interest in what they call zone two
cardio, which is that kind of steady state cardio, where you can just
nasal breathe even at pretty high output, where you could maybe have a
conversation. Although I'm such a huge proponent of nasal breathing
during exercise, most forms of exercise especially zone two cardio,
that you probably shouldn't be talking while you're doing that cardio
unless it's absolutely essential. But periods of zone two cardio that
lasts anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour or sometimes more for your
endurance athletes, can create positive effects on blood sugar
regulation, such that you people can sit down and enjoy whatever it
is, the hot fudge sundae, or whatever the high sugar content food is.
And blood glucose management is so good. Your insulin sensitivity is
so high, which is a good thing, that you can manage that blood glucose
to the point where it doesn't really make you shaky, it doesn't
disrupt you. And you know, to say nothing of the weight-related issues
or the adipose fat gain, et cetera, that's a separate issue because
people vary there. But basically doing zone two cardio for 30 to 60
minutes, three to four times a week makes your blood sugar really
stable, and that's an attractive thing for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=4075"&gt;High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, high intensity interval training or resistance
training AKA weight training, are very good at stimulating the various
molecules that promote repackaging of glycogen. So sprints, heavy
weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided there is some
reasonable degree of resistance, those are going to trigger are all
sorts of mechanisms that are going to encourage the body to shuttle
glucose back into glycogen, converting to glycogen, into muscle
tissue, restock the liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes some time. You know, if you do a couple sets of tricep
extensions and some crunches, you're not depleting your glycogen.
Glycogen depleting workouts are very high intensity. Generally they're
less than an hour or so, but those are the sort that are going to lead
to big increases in the kinds of enzymes and metabolic pathways that
are going to repack glycogen and shuttle most things towards restorage
of foods not into adipose tissue, not into fat, but taking glucose and
making it into fuels that you can access later for more of that high
intensity activity. And I should mention that one of the advantages of
high intensity interval training or weightlifting of various kinds, is
that it causes long standing increases in basal metabolic rate. I
don't want to go too far down this path because we're going to do an
entire month on human performance and athletic performance. But it's
not just the increases in muscle that increase metabolism, because
muscle burns more energy than other types of tissues, except your
brain, which truly burns the most energy. Anyway is the main reason
why your basal metabolic rate is what it is. Well, high-intensity
training. So it could be sprints, it could be high intensity interval
training of different kinds, it could be weight training, also has an
effect of increasing thermogenesis even long after you've completed
the exercise. So there's a long tail. There's a kind of post exercise
metabolic effect that's also beneficial. So it's not an either or,
it's really that high intensity interval training and resistance
training. And things of that sort are very good for one reason. And
the zone two cardio is very good for other reasons. And now you can
see why it's just a healthy thing and why most people should probably
be doing exercise most days of the week, if not every day of the week.
If your goal is to manage blood glucose and your goal is to manage
some of the metabolic factors that control repackaging of glycogen and
encouraging excess glucose to not get diverted into body fat stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=4228"&gt;Cholesterol, HDL, LDL &amp;amp; Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver, Adrenals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't talked a lot about lipids today, that's because most of
today's discussion is about hormones and insulin is the dominant
hormone in terms of mobilizing and managing glucose in the body, at
least for most people. But fats are very important. And there's just a
little anecdote about fats that I think will be useful in thinking
about why you want to manage what they call the LDL or HDL ratios. And
this is deserving an entire episode, many, perhaps even several
episodes. But some of you may be familiar with LDLs and HDLs, some of
you may not. The LDL is low density lipoprotein. This is the one that
you don't want it to be too high. Castillo's dreaming, he's barking.
He loves all forms of cholesterol but that's just Castillo dreaming.
So LDLs are the ones that you want to keep low. You don't want those
to go excessively high. HDLs, the high density lipoproteins are the
ones that are the so-called healthy lipoproteins. That's all fine and
good. But you might ask yourself, what are they doing? What is the
actual role of these things, and why would you want healthy levels of
HDL and not too much LDL? Well, one of the reasons is, that fats don't
like water, right? They are hydrophobic. And yet you need to move fats
in your bloodstream, all tissues in your body need fats. They need
cholesterols, they're... In last episode we talked about cholesterol
is a precursor to the sex steroid hormones, estrogen, and testosterone
and other hormones as well. Well, HDL and LDL, actually coat fats to
allow them to be transported through the bloodstream. They do a number
of other things as well. But HDL, is a key component of the delivery
system that brings those fats to the liver, ovaries, testes, and
adrenals. In other words, having adequate levels of HDL is good,
because it allows fats to be delivered to the tissues that
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol in healthy levels and
the liver. So this is why when LDLs are too high what's happening is
you're not getting fats to the correct tissues. And you can get
buildup of fats like fatty liver disease and some of these things can
happen. A high sugar content can even lead to some of these fatty
liver conditions that starting to happen is actually the first time in
human history perhaps that we're aware of anyway. That we're starting
to see liver conditions that normally were associated only with severe
alcoholism starting to come from sugar content. So what does this
mean? This means keep your LDL and HDL ratios proper. You want those
HDLs in order to deliver fatty molecules to the very tissues that use
cholesterol in order to manufacturer hormones. So how do you keep LDLs
and HDLs in their proper ratios? Well, a lot of people don't realize
this, but the debate about dietary cholesterol and its relationship to
LDL and HDL ratios, it is a barbed wire debate. I don't want to get
into it right now. There are still a lot of open questions as to how
much dietary cholesterol impacts LDL and HDL ratios. I don't want to
get into that now, I'm not taking a stance either way. But what is
very clear, is that having highly elevated glucose, consuming too much
sugar or not managing glucose in your body through some of the
mechanisms that we've been talking about up until now, can also
negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios. So managing glucose goes way beyond
just managing blood sugar, and making sure that you don't lay down too
much body fat, making sure your metabolism stays high and making sure
you're not getting jittery at meals. It also has to do with making
sure that you're creating enough of the molecules HDL and not too many
of the molecules LDL, that are going to disrupt the delivery of things
to the organs of your body that allow you to make healthy levels of
testosterone, estrogen, and so forth. If that wasn't clear, let me
make this ultra simple. You want healthy levels of HDL, and you want
low levels of LDL, because if you have ovaries it will allow the fats
that need to get to the ovary to produce estrogen, to get there. And
if you have testes, it will allow the fats and the cholesterol
molecules that you need in order to manufacture testosterone to get to
the testes. As well, in order to have proper adrenal function and
proper liver function, you want HDL and LDL in the healthy correct
levels. So now we've talked a lot about behavioral tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=4500"&gt;Prescription Compounds That Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the underlying biological mechanisms that justify those tools in
particular circumstances. Now, I'd like to turn to supplements and
prescription drugs that regulate the hormone systems, controlling
feeding and satiety. There are a huge number of these. Some have more
powerful effects than others. There are two that I want to describe
because they've been getting a lot of attention recently. First of
all, there's a prescription drug Metformin, which was developed as a
treatment for diabetes. And it works potently to reduce blood glucose.
It has dramatic effects in lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves
changes to mitochondrial action in the liver. That's its main way of
depleting or reducing blood glucose. And it does so through the so-
called AMPK pathway, and it increases insulin sensitivity overall.
Metformin is a powerful drug. In fact, I'm surprised that so many
people have sought it out, given that most of the people that I'm
aware of that sought it out are not diabetic. I think for diabetics it
seems to be a useful drug. For non-diabetics, it can also of course,
lower blood glucose. It also has the potential to make people
hypoglycemic, genuinely hypoglycemic. So, you really need to approach
Metformin with caution. I get a little concern when I hear about
people blasting Metformin, simply because fasted states or low blood
sugar states are healthy. Doing that pharmacologically can have long
standing effects. You really want to approach that with caution. Now,
there's a comparable drug, it really should be called a drug. But it's
non-prescription, that's also in fairly prominent use out there called
berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=4605"&gt;Berberine: A Potent Glucose Buffer That Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels, Canker Sores&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So berberine is a really interesting compound. Its actions very much
mimic Metformin. So let's talk about berberine for a second. Berberine
actually comes from various plants and tree bark. It is sold in
supplement stores, it's sold online. It is, as far as I know
unregulated, it is powerful. If you're going to experiment with
berberine, you definitely want to talk to your doctor and you want to
approach it with caution. It also works to activate the so-called AMPK
pathway. AMPK by the way stands for Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. And it inhibits a protein tyrosine phosphates 1B
pathway. I think that's enough nomenclature. It activates a certain
pathway that's associated with fasting and low blood glucose. The
effects of berberine are as far as I can tell, when looking at the
literature, are very similar if not identical to Metformin. Now, the
number of studies out there on this are many. So I'm just going to
review a few of them and their major effects. As always, I invite you
to check out examine.com. It's a wonderful website where you can put
in any supplement or compound or biological goal for that matter. And
it will list out the various effects in the human effect matrix. So
studies on humans, if they're available. And it will tell you whether
or not they're strong effects or weak effects or modest effects. And
it will point to the specific subject population, it's a wonderful
resource. So berberine, not surprisingly has very strong effects in
lowering blood glucose. There are four studies on this. In fact, they
say that berberine is one of the more if not the most effective
supplements for lowering blood glucose. It talks about dosages there.
Although I'll just mention that I've tried berberine, and the dosages
that are typical on the bottle of most supplements, is much higher
than I needed. So when I took berberine, two things happened, first of
all, I got a pretty splitting headache. It gave me pretty vicious
headache. So for me it was a no, almost immediately. The other thing
is, I became so hypoglycemic. That in order to get my blood sugar back
up, I think I ate something like 10 donuts and I didn't feel like I
had ingested all that much sugar. It was really kind of weird. I was
hyperphagic for sugar. I was craving sugar, craving sugar and I was
very thirsty as well. And so, I don't want to promote any bad
behavior, but I know that certain people use this when they've
overeaten sugars or they're doing their cheat days, something that I'm
personally just not a fan of. And they want to keep their blood sugar
in check or they know they're going to consume a huge meal. They'll
take berberine to keep blood glucose clamped. And it does do that. It
has very strong effects. Three peer reviewed studies on HbA1c levels.
HbA1c is something that can be measured in a blood test. That is sort
of an average readout of your blood sugar levels over the previous two
or three months, sometimes shorter period. But that's mostly what
HbA1c is about. So, it radically decreases your blood sugar levels. It
actually lowers cholesterol. It acts remember on the liver, and the
liver is involved in cholesterol metabolism. And remember it's both
sugars, blood glucose, and dietary fats. Perhaps it's still heavily
debated in terms of how your blood total cholesterol HDL and LDL are
regulated. So it seems to lower total cholesterol, and it seems like
it lowers HDL and LDL in parallel. So that's interesting. One study
showed a minor increase in HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.
Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed a slight
decrease in LDL, though seem to be kind of minor. Here's a kind of
interesting one, just to help you remember berberine as of the fact
that it comes from tree bark, isn't trigger enough to remember it.
Direct contact of berberine on canker sores seems to eliminate canker
sores very quickly, which is kind of cool. I've not had canker sores
in a few years but when I dig down, they're extremely painful. I don't
like those. So that's kind of interesting, and there's some study
references there. I find it amazing that these compounds exist. You've
got this prescription drug Metformin, and then you've got berberine,
this stuff from tree bark, and they have effects that are essentially
equivalent to one another. So again, I'm not promoting their use or
even their exploration, but those compounds do exist, they're out
there. And check out examine.com if you'd like to learn more.
Certainly do your reading, do your homework, before you start just
popping the stuff. And if you have hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, be
especially careful and also do understand that dosages and dose
requirements vary. So if you do go down this path, really approach
things carefully. Always start with the lowest amount that you could
get away with. For me, the headache thing just made it a no-go. I do
keep a bottle of it in a full disclosure, in the odd chance that I
feel like eating a ton of doughnuts. It's not so much about not
ingesting the calories, it's just that I don't like the feeling of
being hyperglycemic, the blurry vision, just feeling lousy, I do love
donuts. Other things that impact blood glucose in supplement form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=4925"&gt;Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &amp;amp; Zinc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromium has been shown in 29 studies to have a minor, I want to
emphasize a minor effect on reducing blood glucose. Things like
L-carnitine, something we've talked about here on the podcast before
in terms of its relationship to power output in ATP production for
both aerobic and anaerobic exercise, as well as sperm quality and egg
quality. We talked about that long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can
have positive effects on, I should say, can have effects of reducing
blood glucose slightly. I don't want to give a valence to or judgment
to whether or not it's positive or negative. Here's something that's
interesting that you should know about. Caffeine has very reliably
been shown to increase blood glucose just a little bit, okay? So I
always thought that caffeine would drop blood glucose, but it actually
can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium. We
talked about magnesium as a tool for enhancing the passage into sleep,
in particular magnesium threonate and bisglycinate. Magnesium can also
have a modest reduction in blood glucose. You're just trying to get
the impression, everything reduces blood glucose, but that's certainly
not the case. And then a couple episodes ago when we were discussing
nutrition we talked about artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. Some of those are generic names. Some of those might be
brand names and how they have negative effects on the gut microbiome
and that's supported by a number of studies. There's one artificial
sweetener, it's stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, which seems to lower blood
glucose just slightly. And I still can't find data on whether or not
Stevia impacts the gut microbiome in either direction. Many of the
things that I consume do have small amounts of Stevia in them. So I'd
love to know if anyone out there is aware of quality peer reviewed
research, as to whether or not Stevia impacts the gut microbiome
similarly or differently from other artificial sweeteners. Please let
me know. Please send me the references. I'd really appreciate it if
put it in the comment section on YouTube or elsewhere. Comment section
on YouTube would be the best place. So Stevia seems to lower blood
glucose a little bit, which makes it kind of an attractive artificial
sweetener if one is going to use artificial sweeteners. But remember,
sweet taste itself stimulates the desire to eat, which will increase
more blood glucose. So I'm guessing that they probably cancel each
other out. So you have to think logically about these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=5074"&gt;Acids: Vinegar, Lemons &amp;amp; Limes &amp;amp; False Alkalinity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B3, so some of the B vitamins do indeed stimulate appetite by
triggering increases in blood glucose, vitamin B3 in particular. I
don't know if B6 does. Things like zinc seem to lower blood glucose.
And then there've been an enormous number of other things that have
been tested for their roles in blood glucose. Apple cider vinegar,
anything acidic. This is well-known now that any kind of acidity, so
it could be lemon juice or lime juice, or Apple cider vinegar, lowers
blood glucose slightly. Some of those can also have other effects that
we're not talking about today. So that's kind of interesting because
there's a movement now towards creating a sort of people talk about
becoming more alkaline, you know, what these... I hate to break it to
you but you don't really want your body to be too alkaline. You want
to stay in the right pH or else you're start... There are conditions
that make you more alkaline. You don't want to be too acidic or too
alkaline. If you see a beverage or something that purports that
ingesting that beverage is going to make you more alkaline, that is
absolutely false. There's no evidence for that, is impossible
biochemically. It's just marketing. But nonetheless ingesting foods
that are acidic can make some slight adjustments to the pH of the gut
in ways that can slow or alter the absorption of foods and can blunt
blood glucose. You can try this sometime if you want, if ever you're
feeling kind of over sugared out like you ate something with too much
sugar. You can drink a small amount of lemon juice mixed with water or
lime juice, and you'll notice that it will blunt that kind of
hyperglycemic effect just a little bit. Again, you don't want to use
this as a medical tool, but the effect is fairly potent. And then,
excuse me. And then there are a number of other things like capsaicin
and hot chili peppers that will lower blood glucose. The list goes on
and on, The most powerful one is absolutely berberine and Metformin,
but that's really heavy caliber stuff. And the other ones I mentioned
have more minor effects. I do want to mention because I'm sure some of
you out there are curious about the ketogenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=5200"&gt;Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects On Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to do an entire episode about ketosis and the brain and the
body, but the ketogenic diet has been shown in 22 studies to have a
notable decrease on blood glucose. And that is not surprising, because
the essence of the ketogenic diet is that you're consuming very little
or zero of the foods that promote big spikes in insulin and glucose.
If you consume enough protein, some of that protein can be converted
into glucose, of course, through gluconeogenesis. But the ketogenic
diet has a very strong support for its role in regulating blood sugar,
which is glucose. But the specific effects of the ketogenic diet, and
one particular effect that I'll address later but I'll mention now,
which is, the ability of the ketogenic diet to adjust thyroid hormone
levels in ways that make it such that if you return to eating
carbohydrates after being in ketosis for too long, you don't manage
fibroid and carbohydrates as well, that has been shown as well. So
we're going to dive deep into ketosis in a future episode. So for you
ketonistas does out there don't worry, I certainly have nothing
against ketogenic diet. I actually don't have anything for against any
particular nutrition plan. I know it works for me, at least at this
stage in my life. And I'll update it if I need to. I'm simply trying
to get you as much information as I possibly can, so that you can
navigate through that landscape in a way that's in keeping with your
particular goals. So now you understand a lot about blood sugar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=5290"&gt;Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and how it's managed, and the ways that you can manage it better
depending on your particular needs. This is also a good opportunity
for us to look back at some of the medical literature, because it
really points to just how far we've come in terms of understanding
these important mechanisms. And it points us in the direction of some
actionable protocols. So diabetes, which is these huge increases in
blood glucose, because there's no insulin, was known about as early as
1500 BC, which is just incredible. And the way physicians then
understood that certain people had high blood glucose without actually
knowing what blood glucose was, is that they would take the urine of
particular patients, and they'd find that ants preferably move toward
and consume the urine of certain patients and not others. And they
understood that there was something in that urine that was correlated
with the weight loss and some of the other probably very unfortunate
health symptoms that these people were experiencing. So they knew that
there was something in blood and urine. But you might be asking
yourself, wait, that's urine. But as I tell every kid that I meet, two
things. I tell a kid, your brain is here, I make them point to their
head. And then I tell them, do you know what? Do you know that your
urine is actually filtered blood? And they usually go, [grunts]. I get
parental permission to do this first. But most adults don't realize
that your urine is actually just filtered blood. And that's why if you
see blood in your urine, that's a problem. You want to filter the
blood, but urine is filtered blood. Now, this business of measuring
blood sugar from the urine has been something that lasted way beyond
these early stages of 1500 BC. It turns out that as late as 1674,
physicians at Oxford university were figuring out who had
pathologically high levels of blood glucose by analyzing their urine.
And again, they were measuring the sweetness of their urine, and this
is medical fact. They would do this by taking urine samples from
different patients, and tasting them. And they developed an intuitive
sense of what excessively sweet urine was relative to the other urines
that they had tasted. So for those of you that are in the medical
profession or those of you that are seeking out the medical
profession, do you understand this is not done anymore? And you can
also just reflect on how far we've come in terms of the medical
profession itself. In our ability to measure things from the blood and
measure things from urine without having to ask ants which urine is
sweeter or ask oneself, which urine is sweeter. So indeed we are
making progress as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=5468"&gt;The Power of GLP-1 &amp;amp; Yerba Mate For Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we close out today I want to talk about one more tool that many
of you will probably find useful. I certainly have, I'm a big consumer
of caffeine, although I don't consume a ton of it, I consume it very
consistently. So I'm big on consuming Mate, which is a strong
caffeinated tea. And I generally do that early in the day. Although I
do delay about two hours after I wake up for reasons I've talked about
in previous episode, to maintain that nice arc of alertness and focus.
I do drink black coffee as well, mushroom coffee as well, I love that
stuff. But Mate, also called Yerba Mate, is an interesting compound
because unlike coffee, it has been shown to increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. And increase leptin levels. Now, we didn't
talk a lot about glucagon today. Glucagon is really elevated in the
fasting state. I mentioned that it's sort of the opposite of insulin
in kind of rough terms that's one way to think about it. But GLP1, or
glucagon-like peptide one, is increased by ingesting Mate and it acts
as a pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, I'm not trying to suppress
my appetite. I like to eat as I mentioned before. But it works really
well to stimulate the brain and to give you a level of alertness and
to do a lot of the things that coffee does. It also contains
electrolytes. So we meaning our neurons and our brain run on a variety
of factors, electrical activity and chemical transmission, et cetera,
but they require adequate levels of sodium potassium and magnesium.
So, if you were to learn the biology or the physiology of the action
potential, the firing of a neuron, something we teach every first year
neuroscience student, and I'd be happy to teach you if you're
interested. You'll hear about sodium rushing into cells and potassium
entering and leaving cells in order to allow neurons to communicate.
Electrolytes are critically important for the function of the nervous
system. And many things that act as diuretics, that promote excretion
of water, like caffeine, can also take electrolytes out along with in
particular sodium. And sometimes the lightheadedness or the brain fog
that people experience, isn't just because electrolytes are low but
because they're kind of out of balance. So I like Mate because it has
electrolytes, it has caffeine. It stimulates the release of this
glucagon-like peptide GLP1, and it's been a big help to me in
extending that early morning fasting window out to about noon or so
when I eat my first meal. It also just tastes really good. I don't
drink it out of the gourd even though I have Argentine lineage. The
gourd to me it's just kind of an inconvenience, I drink it out of a
mug. There's no promotion here. I have no relationship to any Yerba
Mate plantations or companies, I just happen to really like the stuff.
And the fact that glucagon-like peptide one is enriched or is released
more when you drink Mate. And the fact that GLP1 can regulate blood
sugar in ways that keep your blood sugar in that we called euglycemic,
not too high, not too low mode, is one reason why ingesting Mate is
attractive to me. If you go to South America, well, you'll see
especially among Oregonians, but also Argentines, is people actually
carry a thermos of this stuff with them around and bring it to meals
in restaurants. And it's just considered cultural convention, it's not
unusual to see that. So we don't see that so much here in the States
but I happen to really love this stuff. I brew my own, because that's
the most economical way to do it. And I really enjoy it. It can be a
little bitter for some people. The real key there if you want to know,
the Mate trick is to not use water that's really boiling hot. You go
just shy of boil and then it doesn't have that same kind of tobacco
like or really acidic flavor to it. It's just a little bit sweeter,
although not quite sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage in healthy
ways leptin levels, glucose levels, and glucagon levels in ways that
if it serves you, that you might want to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&amp;amp;t=5719"&gt;Summary &amp;amp; Notes About Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once again, we covered an enormous amount of material, focused on
how hormones regulate feeding, hunger, and when one feels they don't
need to eat, so-called satiety, that you've had enough. As always, we
covered a lot, but I could not be exhaustive about all the information
related to this topic. It's just so vast. For instance, we did not
talk about thyroid hormone, an extremely important hormone and pathway
in the body and brain. We are going to do an episode related to
thyroid and tools to regulate thyroid, I promise. Having seen this
episode, you will be able to digest that material with far more ease.
We also didn't talk about the fact that testosterone and estrogen can
impact blood glucose in ways that are opposite to one another. That
when estrogen levels are high, appetite tends to be reduced. When
testosterone levels are high, appetite tends to increase. So there are
all sorts of interesting interplays between the various hormones. But
that's too much of a deep dive of now. Right now, we've just focused
today mainly on things like ghrelin, on things like, Melanocyte
simulating hormone, incredible powerful hormone that can suppress
appetite. On things like Cholecystokinin that comes from the gut and
can suppress appetite. On things like food emulsifiers. On the fact
that when you're eating you are amino acids seeking, even though you
might not realize it. That you are also seeking out particular fatty
acids in particular, the conjugated linoleic acids and Omega-3's. So
I've tried to give you a number of actionable tools. Many of them
behavioral. Some of them are based on supplements or even prescription
drugs. Again, always do what's best for your health, and do that in
company with a healthcare professional. I'm not a physician, I don't
prescribe anything. I'm a professor, I profess a lot of things. And I
try and share with you what I think to be the best high quality peer
reviewed literature. So that's what I've done today. Really appreciate
your time and intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I misspoke
when explaining POMC neurons. I said “P-M-O-C” but should have said
“POMC”. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was
correct: "proopiomelanocortin".&lt;/p&gt;

also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and
endurance training) and sex, or observing sex impact these hormones
and their levels. I ask: "what specifically is it about such
activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?"; the resounding
theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways
it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or
repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss
peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic
level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can
positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we
discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies
illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing
their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by
changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I
discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these
hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause
and andropause. As always a mix of basic science, biological
mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford, it is, however, part of my desire and
effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. Before we begin today,
just want to acknowledge that if you're watching this on YouTube, yes,
I have a bandage on the left side of my face, I was trying to cook
something for Costello and I and I got burned, burned myself, it was a
cooking accident. I'm fine, no need to dwell on it, we can move on,
but I just wanted to let you know everybody's going to be okay, he got
a great meal, I got a burn and a great meal. Today's episode is
brought to us by Four Sigmatic. Four Sigmatic is a wellness company
that makes mushroom coffee. For those of you that haven't heard of
mushroom coffee before, I just want to make clear, these are not
psychedelic mushrooms, and no, the coffee does not taste like
mushrooms at all. It tastes amazing and it tastes like coffee. I
started using Four Sigmatic coffee a few years ago and then we
actually stocked it in my lab, we still stock it in my lab because it
tastes really good and it also happens to have two types of mushrooms
in it that I particularly like because of their supplement and
medicinal qualities, and those two are lion's mane mushroom, which has
been shown in several research studies to have a mild anxiolytic,
meaning anti-anxiety effect, and mood-elevating effect, those are from
research studies done independently, as well, it has Chaga mushroom,
Chaga mushroom has been shown to increase growth factors that impact
the nervous system, like nerve growth factor, so that's the reason I
drink it, and that's the reason we stock it in the lab, and that's the
reason why I drink it at home. If you'd like to try Four Sigmatic, you
can go to foursigmatic.com/huberman, that's F-O-U-R-S-I-G-M-A-T-I-C,
.com/huberman, and you'll get up to 40% off your order plus free
shipping on their mushroom coffees, that's foursigmatic.com/huberman
for up to 40% off and free shipping. Today's episode is also brought
to us by Blinkist. Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction
books condensed down to just 15 minutes of key takeaways that you can
read or listen to. For me, I really like listening to books on
Blinkist, even books that I've already read. Typically, the way I
consume information is, unless it's fiction, I'll listen to a
nonfiction book or I'll read the actual, physical hard copy of a
nonfiction book, and then at the end, I like to take some notes about
things that really stuck with me or key takeaways that I'd like to
teach or share with other people. With Blinkist, it allows me to go
back to those books and get all the essential items, some of which I
might have missed in the course of listening to or reading the full-
length version, and if I haven't read a book before, it also gives me
a sense of whether or not I'd like to read the book. Blinkist has some
terrific science category books, for example, my colleague and friend
David Eagleman's book, "Livewired," which came out recently, is all
about neuroplasticity, it's a fantastic book, I read the full-length
book, and I've listened to it on Blinkist, and it's a terrific
synopsis of "Livewired," that's in there. David Sinclair's book,
"Lifespan," many of you probably know that David Sinclair, professor
of genetics at Harvard Medical School, is a real pioneer in the aging
and longevity field, his book "Lifespan" is terrific, I've read the
full-length book, I've listened to it, and I've listened to it on
Blinkist, and so it really captures a lot of the essential elements
that you would want to get from that book. Blinkist is also just a
great way to get through many books on the bookshelf that you've been
meaning to get to but you haven't had time. With Blinkist, you can get
unlimited access to read or listen to a massive library of books, not
just science books, and they're all condensed in this way of just 15
minutes will allow you to get all the key information, so right now,
for a limited time, Blinkist has a special offer just for "Huberman
Lab Podcast" audiences, you go to blinkist.com/huberman and you can
try Blinkist free for seven days and save 25% off your new
subscription, that's Blinkist, B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T, .com/huberman to start
your free seven-day trial, and you'll get 25% off, but only when you
sign up at blinkist.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to
us by Theragun. Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device that
releases deep muscle tension. I was introduced to Theragun on a dive
expedition for my laboratory a few years ago. On that expedition, we
were working very hard, we were diving all day, we were carrying
pelican cases with equipment, we were carrying tanks, very sore, very
tired by the end of the day, as was everybody else. Someone brought
along a Theragun, and pretty soon, that thing was getting passed
around and became the most coveted device on board because it really
works to relieve the soreness and deep muscle tension that accumulates
with physical work, exercise, even just sitting too long throughout
the day, so when I got back, I got a Theragun, I still use the
Theragun daily, it's terrific because it's very quiet so you can use
it while watching a movie or even while having a conversation without
it feeling intrusive, it really gets down into the meat of the muscle
if you want, or you can use it more superficially if you like. If you
want to try Theragun, you can go to theragun.com/huberman, they have
several models available, the first one starts at $190, which if you
think about it, is comparable to the price of a professional massage
except that unlike a professional massage, you can use the Theragun
for as long as you want throughout the day and for as many days as you
like, that's theragun.com/huberman, and I should mention that there's
also a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you don't like the product,
you send it back, you get your money back. This month on the "Huberman
Lab Podcast,"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=350"&gt;Hormone Optimization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we're talking all about hormones, these incredible chemicals that can
impact our mood, our behavior, our feelings of optimism or pessimism.
The amazing thing about hormones is that hormones impact all those
things, but all those things, how we feel and what we do and what we
think also can impact our hormones, and so it's a really fascinating
area of biology that impacts every single one of us every day both in
wakefulness and in sleep and throughout the lifespan. Today, we're
going to be talking about hormone optimization, and we're mainly going
to be focusing on estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives.
Last episode of the "Huberman Lab Podcast," we talked about sexual
development, that is, how the chromosomes, the gonads, and hormones
impact what we call sexual development, leading all the way up to
puberty. Today, we're mainly going to talk about processes that happen
from puberty onward, although we might talk a little bit about
development as well, so today, we're going to talk a lot about basic
biology, but we're going to weave in a lot of practical tools along
the way for how to optimize these incredibly powerful things that we
call hormones. Before we dive into our discussion about hormone
optimization,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=420"&gt;Salutogenesis: A Powerful Way to Conceptualize Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to raise what I think is a very important point that at least I
hadn't heard of until recently, which is the concept of salutogenesis.
Many of us are familiar with the concept of pathogenesis, the idea
that there are all these scary diseases like dementia and heart
disease and stroke, and all these things that await us if we don't
take good care of ourselves and that might await us even if we do,
that's the pathogenic model, salutogenesis is something I learned
about from one of my Stanford Medicine colleagues, which is a
different orientation toward health and well-being where you're taking
on particular behaviors, you're taking on a particular stance towards
nutrition and exercise, supplementation, et cetera, in order to
promote well-being above where you would be if you were not doing
those behaviors. Now, if you think about it, these two things,
salutogenesis and the pathogenic model, are really two sides of the
same coin, but I'll just give an example of how this might affect you
in a real way. If you like exercise because it feels good, great, but
many people exercise, or eat well, for that matter, in order to avoid
heart disease or to avoid dementia, to avoid negative changes in body
composition, and while that's powerful and certainly is the case that
exercise will help you move away from all those things, the
salutogenesis model differs in that it involves a mindset and an
orientation towards doing those things in order to feels good, in
order to enhance your level of energy, in order to improve endocrine
function and metabolic function, so it's really part of the pathogenic
model, and yet, salutogenesis is really more of a mindset toward why
you would do these particular behaviors, and really, the most powerful
mindset is going to be one where you are thinking about the pathogenic
model, doing things so that you don't end up sick, et cetera, and to
move away from sickness, as well as the salutogenic model where you're
doing things in order to move towards health and well-being. We think
of health and wellness nowadays, or the wellness community or wellness
practices, and in many ways, that is the essence of the salutogenic
model, but I found it very interesting to know that within the field
of allopathic medicine, these two models exist but we don't hear about
the salutogenic model quite as often, so it's just something to keep
in mind, especially because of some of the mindset effects that were
discussed in previous episodes, I'm not going to go into these in
detail again right now, but if you might recall from the episode on
food and mood, we talked about some of these incredible studies that
were done by Alia Crum's group at Stanford and others showing that if
you tell people that the behavior that they're about to do, in this
case, it was people cleaning up hotel rooms because that was their
job, if you tell them that it's good for them, then you see much
greater positive health effects than if they aren't aware of that
information that it's good for them, so we should really be thinking
about not just moving away from disease and negative things, but also
why certain things are good for us because it's well-established now
from really good scientific studies that keeping in mind the positive
effects of things can really have an outsized effect on well-being,
right down to the level of our physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=603"&gt;Estrogen and Testosterone: Sources, Levels &amp;amp; Ratios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about hormone optimization, today we're going to talk
about hormone optimization in reference to estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives, now, estrogen and testosterone and their
derivatives are what we call sex steroids, now, the sex steroids
immediately call to mind sex, for obvious reasons, and steroids,
meaning anabolic steroids, but I just want to emphasize that estrogen
and testosterone are present in everybody, it's their ratios that
determine their effects, and so today we're going to talk about how
you can optimize their ratios depending on your particular life goals
because the ratio of estrogen and testosterone in every individual has
profound influence on feelings of well-being, feelings of optimism,
feelings of anxiety or lack of anxiety, on reproduction, on sexual
behavior independent of reproduction, they are profoundly powerful
molecules, and we all make these molecules, to some degree or another,
but there are also important behavioral tools, supplementation tools,
as well as prescription drugs that can impact the ratios of
testosterone and estrogen in really powerful ways, so we're going to
cover all of that. I want to emphasize that when you hear sex steroids
or steroid hormones, most people think about anabolic steroids, and of
course, anabolic steroids are derivatives of testosterone or
testosterone itself, and they are heavily used and abused in the
sports community as well as outside the sports community, but there,
of course, are many steroids that are not anabolic steroids that are
also abused in sports. Today, we're not talking about drugs in sports,
but I think that it carries such a heavy weight when people hear the
word steroids, they think about anabolic steroids, so while today's
discussion will certainly be relevant to physical performance, in
fact, we're going to talk about how specific types of exercise,
particular patterns of cold exposure, as well as particular patterns,
believe it or not, of breathing can impact sex steroid hormones, both
estrogen and testosterone, the discussion isn't really geared towards
performance enhancement in sport, although we will do an entire
episode, perhaps even an entire month related to performance
enhancement in physical enterprises. So one of the first things to
understand if you want to optimize your hormones is where they come
from. There are a lot of different glands in the body that produce
hormones, there's the pineal gland, some hormones are made in the
hypothalamus, hormones are made by the gonads, the ovaries or the
testes, you've got the thyroid gland, there are a bunch of different
glands that make these different hormones, but when we're talking
about the sex steroid hormones, estrogen and testosterone, the major
sources are ovaries for estrogen and the testes for testosterone,
although the adrenals can also make testosterone. Now, there are also
some enzymes, enzymes are things that can change chemical composition,
and the enzymes that we're going to talk about today are the
aromatases mainly, the aromatases convert testosterone into estrogen,
so in a male, for instance, that has very high testosterone, some of
that is going to be converted into estrogen by aromatase, and
aromatase is made by body fat, it's also made in the testes
themselves, a lot of people don't realize this, but the testes
actually have the capacity to manufacture estrogen and aromatase,
albeit at low levels, but this turns out to be important for
optimizing hormone levels in males at later points, and we'll discuss
that. It's important to note that there's a huge range in terms of the
levels of hormones, testosterone and estrogen, between individuals,
and it actually occurs within individuals across the lifespan, I'm not
going to throw out specific numbers of X picograms per deciliter, et
cetera today because that's going to vary a lot, it's going to depend
on whether or not you're measuring in picograms or nanograms and that
sort of thing, if you want to examine your hormones, you should do
that in conjunction with a medical doctor, ideally, an endocrinologist
can help you sort out that information, but the important thing to
know is that prepubescent females make very little estrogen, and when
we talk about estrogen, we mainly talk about estradiol, which is the
most active form of estrogen in both males and females. So
prepubescent females, very low levels of estrogen, during puberty,
levels of estrogen, AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket, and then
across the lifespan, estrogen is going to vary depending on the stage
of the menstrual cycle, but as one heads into menopause, which
typically takes place nowadays somewhere between age 45 and 60, levels
of estrogen are going to drop and then post-menopause levels of
estrogen are very low. As well, testosterone will fluctuate across the
lifespan, testosterone is going to be relatively low prepuberty in
males, during puberty, it's going to skyrocket, and then the current
numbers are that it drops off at about a rate of 1% per year, although
we're going to talk about some data that show that there's actually
tremendous variation in testosterone levels, there's actually a lot of
examples of men in their 90s, their 90s, who still have testosterone
levels that mimic pubertal levels, which is remarkable and speaks to
the huge variation in testosterone levels across individuals. So let's
talk about other sources of these hormones, and then it will make
clear what avenues you might want to take in order to optimize these
hormones. The other glands and tissues in the body that make these
hormones, testosterone and estrogen, as I mentioned briefly, are the
adrenals, so the adrenals right on top of the kidneys, and the release
of these steroid hormones from the adrenals, in particular
testosterone and some of its related derivatives, are mainly activated
by competition, so let's talk about competition because it turns out
that competition is a powerful influence on the sex steroid hormones,
and the sex steroid hormones powerfully influence competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=946"&gt;The Power of Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence &amp;amp; Dopamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So most people don't realize this, but most males of a given mammalian
species never get to reproduce, in fact, they never even get to have
sex at all, and we don't often think about that, but testosterone
plays a powerful role in determining which members of a given species
will get to reproduce, which ones of that species will actually get
access to females, and so here I'm not talking about humans
specifically, but it's well known in species like elephant seals, in
species like antlered animals and rams, for instance, that the higher
levels of testosterone correlate with access to females. Now, one
interpretation of this is that the females are detecting which males
have high testosterone and selecting them, they're more receptive to
them, we're going to talk about receptivity for mating in a moment,
but it's actually more so that the males that have higher testosterone
forage further and will fight harder for the females, and this is
really interesting because there's very good evidence now that
testosterone can reduce anxiety, promote novelty-seeking, and promote
competitive interactions, and so before you leap too far with this in
your mind and think about all these human behaviors, just stay with me
because there's a little bit of biology here that makes it all make
sense and it turns out to be pretty simple. We have a brain region
called the amygdala, in Latin, that just means almond, but the
amygdala is most famous for its role in fear, we hear a lot about fear
and the amygdala, but that the amygdala is really involved in threat
detection, it sets our thresholds for anxiety and what we consider
scary or too much, testosterone secreted from the gonads and elsewhere
in the body binds to the amygdala and changes the threshold for
stress, so I've said before on previous versions of this podcast and
on other podcasts that testosterone has this incredible effect of
making effort feel good, but what I was really referring to is the
fact that testosterone lowers stress and anxiety, in particular, in
males in a given species. Now, this is important because we often
think of testosterone as creating, whatever, masculinization or it's,
you know, virilization, or all these terms are thrown around, but
what's it really doing when it comes to mate choice and competition?
What it's doing is it's reducing the threshold for anxiety, and in
doing so, it selects individuals of a given species to push further,
being willing to suffer more, although it also reduces pain, so maybe
they also suffer less, in pursuit of reproduction and females. Now,
it's well known in humans that both males and females who have
elevated levels of testosterone will engage in more novelty-seeking,
and I do want to point out that even individuals without testes have
testosterone, and peaks in testosterone have similar effects
regardless of whether or not someone has ovaries or testes,
testosterone increases generally lead to more foraging, more novelty-
seeking, increases in libido, and increases in desire to mate, so it
is the case that increases in testosterone promote competitive and
foraging-type behaviors in humans and in nonhuman mammals, but it's
also true that competition itself can increase androgens, such as
testosterone, I want to repeat that, competitive environments
themselves can increase testosterone. Now, some people have come to
the conclusion that if you win, your testosterone goes up, and if you
lose, your testosterone goes down, and to some extent, that's true,
but that's not a direct effect on the gonads, that's actually mediated
by the neuromodulator dopamine, we talked about dopamine in the
episode on motivation and drive, and dopamine and testosterone have a
remarkable interplay in the body, dopamine is actually released in the
brain in ways that has the pituitary, this gland that sits over the
roof of your mouth, release certain hormones that then go on to
promote the release of more testosterone, and indeed, winning promotes
more dopamine, and later, more testosterone, however, in the short
term, just competing increases testosterone independent of whether or
not you win or lose, so the short version of this is that competition
increases testosterone, and this may be an ancient mechanism whereby
the androgens, such as testosterone, are feeding back to encourage
more competitive-type behaviors because every species, whether or not
you're talking about reproduction or other resource allocation, is
involved in competition, not every individual of a species gets access
to the same number of mates or the same quality of mates, and this is
true in both directions, for males and females and everything in
between. So I just want to emphasize once more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=1258"&gt;Testosterone &amp;amp; Libido Pre-Ovulation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in case I went through it too quickly that increases in testosterone
in females are also going to lead to increase in reproductive behavior
or seeking out reproductive behavior, they increase libido, in fact,
there's a particular phase of the menstrual cycle where testosterone
peaks just before ovulation that, on average, leads female humans to
seek out sex more than they would otherwise during their cycle, and
this is all by self-report, but this is also while measuring things
like testosterone-estrogen ratios, and so forth, so it's really
interesting that a single molecule, regardless of chromosomal or
gonadal background, is increasing seeking of mates across individuals,
increasing desire to compete or willingness to compete, and lowering
the threshold for stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=1308"&gt;Estrogen &amp;amp; Sexual Receptivity; Libido In Males&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to point out that while increases in testosterone
promote seeking of mates and reproduction in both males and females,
in females, it's actually increases in estrogen that promote
receptivity to mating, so testosterone is driving the seeking of sex
and estrogen is promoting the actual act of sex from females, so-
called receptivity, consensual receptivity. In males, it's interesting
to point out that testosterone is promoting seeking of sex, but it's
also estrogen in males that's important for libido, if estrogen levels
are brought too low, then men will completely lose their libido, this
is often not discussed or overlooked in the discussion about
testosterone therapy and performance-enhancing drugs, people think
that hyperandrogenized individuals, meaning people that have very high
levels of androgen will have very high levels of libido, and they
will, provided estrogen is available in sufficient ratios to match
that testosterone, so it's not simply the case that high levels of
testosterone produce a lot of sex and mating behavior and low levels
of estrogen are good across the board, you actually need both in both
males and females, it's just that in females, the testosterone levels
are always going to be lower than the estrogen levels, and in males,
the estrogen levels are always going to be lower than testosterone
levels, so testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior, and the real
question then is, does sex itself promote testosterone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=1390"&gt;How Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the answer is somewhat complicated, but the short version is yes,
and as you recall, sex has multiple stages, so there's the physical
act of sex, there's the seeking of sex, and then there's orgasm and
ejaculation. Now, it's important to distinguish between these because
whether or not sex itself increases testosterone depends on whether or
not the male ejaculates, and this is very important to understand
because on a previous episode, I mentioned how dopamine increases with
sexual activity, remember, dopamine and testosterone tend to increase
linearly with one another, but then after ejaculation, there's a
release of prolactin, and prolactin actually sets the refractory
period in males during which he can't have sex again, and the duration
of the refractory period will vary tremendously depending on how much
and how long that prolactin release occurs. I also described in a
previous episode how some people take vitamin B6, I'm not suggesting
anyone do this, but take vitamin B6 in order to reduce prolactin
levels and thereby reduce the duration of the refractory period, but
getting at this question about testosterone and sexual behavior, it's
important to distinguish between these different phases of
reproduction or reproductive behaviors, so there are studies showing
that sexual behavior itself can increase testosterone, there was a
study published in 2011 from Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A, this is the
stuff of textbooks, this is on PubMed, these are quality studies,
showing that men who observe sex, so I guess this would be observing
pornography, will have slight increases in testosterone during the
observation, these people actually were willing to have blood draws
taken while watching pornography, they had increases in testosterone
that were very modest, of about 10%, whereas when people participated
in sex, so they actually did this study where people had blood draws
and they had real sex with their partners, and they had 70% increases
in testosterone, so there are increases in testosterone that are quite
significant during the physical act of sex and far less so during
observing sex. Now, the question that I often get, in fact, it's one
of the questions I get most often in the comments on YouTube, I don't
know why that is, is whether or not ejaculation adjusts testosterone
levels, and it turns out, there are two studies that I could find that
were quality studies on PubMed that address this, that sex and
ejaculation itself does not reduce testosterone levels although it
will increase prolactin levels for the reasons I described a moment
ago, however, abstinence or sex without ejaculation for a week or more
will increase testosterone levels up to 400%, so the answer is
actually complicated, it's not straightforward, what it means is that
sex itself increases testosterone, however, abstinence also increases
testosterone even further, so it's a nuanced answer, and I hope this
is satisfactory, no pun intended, to those of you that have been
asking me, what is the relationship between sex and ejaculation and
testosterone and dopamine? It is nuanced, and you have to understand
that nuance if you want to understand how certain behaviors impact
hormones and how hormones impact those behaviors. As I mentioned
before, in females,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=1606"&gt;Testosterone &amp;amp; Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testosterone also primes the motivation to seek out sex, and sex
itself also increases testosterone, but it also increases prolactin,
so in both men and women, sex increases prolactin post-sex, it's just
the way that the system works, it's that testosterone and dopamine
increase in the seeking-out and the behavior of sex, and then after
sex, prolactin levels go up, there's kind of a quiescence, the whole
nervous system is promoted towards calm, and this may actually have
something to do with pair-bonding and the encouragement of individuals
to spend more time together to exchange different smells and hormones,
and maybe even pheromones, and we're going to talk about pheromones in
a moment. A few years ago, there was a lot of excitement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=1650"&gt;DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects on Levels/Ratios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about the hormone DHEA, which is mainly made by the adrenals, DHEA has
been promoted as kind of a catch-all for increasing testosterone and
estrogen in males and females, and indeed, DHEA will increase both
testosterone and estrogen, this is something to be mindful of if
you're thinking about taking DHEA or you're taking DHEA already. DHEA
will increase both testosterone and estrogen, and the extent to which
it increases one or the other will depend on whether or not you're
starting off with more estrogen than testosterone or whether or not
you're starting off with more testosterone than estrogen and whether
or not you have a lot of aromatase, so for individuals that have a lot
of aromatase being made by the testes or by body fat, if you take
DHEA, there's a good chance that a fair portion of that is going to be
shuttled towards estrogen production and not towards testosterone
production, whereas in individuals that have low levels of
testosterone to begin with, high levels of estrogen, there's a good
chance that the DHEA is going to promote mainly estrogen production,
at least that's what I could find from the research studies that I
examined. So the way to think about DHEA, it's a kind of global
promoter of the sex steroid hormones, and its specific effects are
going to depend a little bit on where you started and whether or not
you have ovaries or testes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=1725"&gt;Behaviors That Decrease Testosterone (&amp;amp; Cortisol): Parenting &amp;amp; Prolactin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just as there are behaviors that can increase testosterone, there
are behaviors that can decrease testosterone, and one of the most
well-characterized ones in humans is becoming a parent. So expecting
fathers have an almost 50% decrease in testosterone levels, both free
and bound testosterone, as well, their cortisol levels, a stress
hormone, drop by almost three-fold, which is incredible, and their
estradiol levels double, so their estrogen levels double, so expecting
fathers many people have known put on additional body weight, everyone
always thought that it's because they're eating in parallel with their
pregnant wife, but it turns out that these effects of reduced
testosterone, increased estradiol, and reduced cortisol can all be
explained by an increase in prolactin, so not just in humans, but in
other species as well, when the male and female of that species are
expecting young, they lay down more body fat, the assumption is that
this is to prepare for long nights of no sleep, which occurs in many
species, not just in humans, so it's really interesting that this
hormone, prolactin, can start suppressing whole categories of
hormones, sex steroid hormones, and can start increasing whole
categories of other ones, so we hear about the dad bod, there are a
lot of explanations for the dad bod that extend well beyond this
podcast episode, but it is a well-known phenomenon that testosterone
is going to drop, prolactin's going to increase, estradiol's going to
increase in males and females that are expecting children. Now, how
long that lasts is very interesting, it actually has to do with how
much contact and how much contact with smells of the baby, of the
offspring, the father happens to have, so how available or unavailable
he is will actually impact his level of hormones, now, I'm definitely
not promoting the idea that fathers or mothers take time away from
their offspring in order to keep their testosterone levels high or to
restore them, that's not what I'm saying at all, it's just interesting
to point out that these evolutionary mechanisms push us toward or bias
us toward particular categories of behaviors by influencing our
hormones, which then feed back and promote more of that particular
behavior because as I mentioned before, peaks in testosterone in males
and females cause individuals to seek sex, not promote parenting,
whereas reductions in testosterone, increases in prolactin, and
decreases in cortisol move individuals of both sexes toward parenting
behavior and less toward reproductive behavior. The other behavior
that markedly reduces testosterone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=1884"&gt;How Illness Impacts Testosterone &amp;amp; Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in both males and females and markedly reduces the desire for seeking
sex and sex itself is illness, and many of you might say, "Well, duh,
when people feel sick, "they don't feel like seeking out mates, "they
don't feel like having sex," but have you ever wondered why that
actually is? Well, it turns out that it can be explained by the
release of what are called inflammatory cytokines, so cytokines are
related to the immune system, they travel in the lymph and in the
blood, and they attack invader cells like bacteria and viruses, and
under conditions of illness, we make a lot of different cytokines,
some of them are anti-inflammatory, but some of them are pro-
inflammatory, and the best-known example of a pro-inflammatory
cytokine is IL-6, and it's known that IL-6, when injected into
individuals, will decrease the desire for sex and eventually will
reduce levels of testosterone and estrogen independent of feeling
lousy, so the reason why people don't want sex when they're sick is
because levels of IL-6 are increased. Now, this is important because
as we start to think about the different ways to modulate the sex
steroid hormones, so-called optimize the hormones, keeping levels of
IL-6 low is going to be important for them to exert their effects,
now, IL-6 doesn't just travel to the gonads and shut down the gonads,
it actually has ways to interact with some of the receptors that the
steroid hormones, estrogen and testosterone, bind to, and impact those
receptors so that the sex steroid hormones can't have their effect. In
short and put simply, inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 are bad for sex
steroid hormones, and so we're going to talk about how to modulate
IL-6 in the direction that you would want and how to increase another
cytokine called IL-10, which is anti-inflammatory in ways that can
help promote, or at least support, the sex steroid hormones. So as we
move forward,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=2000"&gt;How Exactly Do Behaviors Change Hormones?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we're going to now start to consider what sorts of behavioral
practices, as well as other things, can modulate the sex steroid
hormones in the directions that you want them to go, but before we do
that, and in order to set the stage for that, you should be asking
yourself, how is it, or why is it, at a mechanistic level, that
behaviors can modulate hormones at all? If you think about it, it's
kind of strange that just the mere act of being a parent or parenting
can change testosterone levels so dramatically or estradiol levels so
dramatically, what is it? Is it the sweat of the baby? Is it their
saliva? Is it the sight of the baby? Is it holding the baby, or is it
all those things? It turns out that many of those effects are because
of smell, or in some cases, even possibly pheromones. Now, I talked
about hormones, hormones, again, are a chemical, travels in the body,
impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body, a pheromone is a
chemical that's released by one member of a species that goes and
impacts members elsewhere, but of the same species, or even of other
species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=2058"&gt;Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, &amp;amp; Mate Recognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, pheromone effects are absolutely well-established in lots of
animal species, but they are very controversial in humans. Today, I'm
going to talk about some of the well-established ones in animals, I've
mentioned one or two of these before on previous podcasts, but I
haven't mentioned several of them, and I'm going to talk about the
evidence for pheromones in humans that are well-established. So the
main ones in animals that are discussed are called the Lee-Boot
effect, the Whitten effect, the Bruce effect, and the Vandenbergh
effect, named after the people that discovered them. The Lee-Boot
effect is when you house females of a given species together with no
males, they start displaying longer, what are called estrus cycles, in
many species, they don't have menstrual cycles, which are 28 days,
they have estrus cycles which tend to be four days or some variant
thereof. It's an interesting phenomenon because what it means is that
the presence of the male itself is changing the ovulation cycle. Now,
many people out there, I imagine mostly the people that are ovulating
out there will say, "Of course, I notice I ovulate differently, "or my
cycle changes when I'm in the presence of my partner "or I'm not," but
the pheromone effect that mirrors this Lee-Boot effect in humans has
still not really been identified, nobody knows what the exact chemical
is, but nonetheless, this is a strong effect in some animals. The
other one is the Bruce effect, and this is a very dramatic effect
whereby a pregnant animal will abort or reabsorb her fetus if the dad
of those animals, the father that sired the litter, because these are
animals, they're litters, is removed and a novel male is placed in her
vicinity for about 48 hours, and what's interesting is the way that
this happens is a pheromone that comes from male urine activates the
gonadotropin-releasing hormone system and causes a reintroduction of
the estrus cycle and a spontaneous abortion of the fetus. Now, a lot
of people have taken the Bruce effect kind of to its extreme and asked
whether or not in humans, miscarriages are caused by detecting the
pheromones or odors of novel males, meaning the non-dad male, and
that's still an open question, nobody knows if that's true or not, so
I want to emphasize that. The other one is the Vandenbergh effect, and
this is one I alluded to in a previous episode of the podcast, which
is that puberty in females can be accelerated by placing a novel
sexually competent male in with a young female who has not undergone
puberty. There's also a version of this, which I haven't described,
which is delay of puberty where you take juvenile female animals that
have not undergone puberty and you put them with more mature females
of the same species, and that introduction of more females will cause
a delay, a significant delay in the onset of puberty. So these are all
pheromone effects, and we know they're pheromone effects because
they're not conscious, they also don't require actual contact with the
other members of a given species, these are all effects that can be
mediated by the urine from a given species or by the sweat of a given
species, and speaking of sweat, the one pheromone effect that I'm very
aware of from the published literature is a paper that was published
in 1998 by Stern and McClintock which was getting at this question of
synchronization of menstrual cycles. Now, the whole idea of
synchronization of menstrual cycles is pretty controversial, for a
long time, people said, "Oh, this is absolutely a well-characterized
phenomenon," people in dormitories, their menstrual cycles would
synchronize, people living in environments together, their menstrual
cycles would synchronize, and then some studies came out that kind of
undercut those data and said no, this actually doesn't happen, and it
was kind of controversial, but there is a very clear effect that was
described by Stern and McClintock, what they did actually was they
took females, they charted their cycles, and then they had other
females wear pads in their armpits and they collected sweat from those
females, and then they took the sweat from those pads in those
female's armpits, and they introduced them to women who had never had
contact with the people who had sweated, they only had contact with
their sweat, in fact, they swabbed it underneath their nose, and if
that sounds gross, they dilute it in alcohol, so much so that they
can't actually detect the odor of the sweat, that's actually very
important because it's not the smell, it's the pheromone chemical
itself, and it turns out the pheromone chemical itself can modulate
the menstrual cycle, although it doesn't necessarily synchronize it
with the sweater, what it does is it changes the duration and the
pattern of ovulation relative to the so-called follicular phase, long
and short of this is that the sweat and pheromones of females can
modulate the menstrual cycle patterns of other adult females, it's
just a question of whether or not they synchronize, and if you're kind
of rolling your eyes now and saying, "Well, of course they do, "and
this is really detailed," this is how the science is done, and the
reason why people are so skeptical about the presence of pheromone
effects in humans is that there's no well-identified pheromone organ,
you know, we have an area of our nose that's responsible for smelling,
that's well-established, it's been observed in MRIs many, many times,
in cadavers many, many times, in pretty much all individuals, but the
vomeronasal organ, which is the pheromone-detecting organ, hasn't
really been found in humans, there's something called Jacobson's
organ, which is thought to be the organ in the nose, it's actually on
the top of the roof of the mouth and in the kind of back of the nose,
this is for you wine tasters, I never can pronounce this, what are
they called, sommelier, whatevers, the people that are excellent at
drinking and detecting the essences of wine that you have to go
through all these tests in order to get certified as one of them,
somebody tell me, they are using probably a similar mechanism of
mixing taste and smell, and Jacobson's organ, if it exists, the
vomeronasal equivalent in humans, is thought to be a combination of
smell and taste. Now, it gets even weirder and cooler when you think
about a given study that was done in humans where if you take hundreds
of t-shirts from boyfriends, keep them separate, you take those
t-shirts, you wash them many times separately, and then you offer them
to the girlfriends, the long-time partners of those guys, and what
you'll find is that the girlfriend can pick out her boyfriend's
t-shirt among hundreds of other t-shirts, not because it smells
different, but because something about it seems different, it might
smell different to her in some way that's kind of imperceptible even
to her, and the level of accuracy in detecting that t-shirt, her
partner's t-shirt, is way above statistical significant thresholds, so
much so that you almost have to say there's something about these
effects that are real pheromone effects, although people still argue
that there are no pheromone effects in humans, that it's all through
olfaction, I think these are interesting and important to understand
because it means that a lot of things coming through our nose, whether
or not it's pheromones or smells, are impacting hormones and our
ability to attach memories and kind of recognition of mates and other
people, including our children, not just our mates, and of course,
perfume manufacturers have really picked up on the idea of pheromones
and have entire laboratories set up to build chemical compounds into
perfumes that are designed to attract other mates, this is a well-
established and well-documented phenomenon. And the last point I'll
make about pheromones is that this combination of taste and smell is
such a real thing in the animal world that there's something called
the flehmen response, during the mating seasons for different animals,
you can actually even see this in horses, but for animals that are
seasonal maters, they'll do something called the flehmen response
where they actually open their lips and their mouth and they expose
their gums so that they can capture pheromones that are floating in
the wind in the environment, they actually are looking for mates using
their mouth and kind of sniffing around. If you own a dog and you
watch the way that the dog will sniff around selecting where they want
to urinate, males and females, they're bringing molecules into their
nose, I know it sounds kind of gross, sniffing urine, but there are a
lot of pheromones in urine of animals, a lot of pheromones that are
traveling in the wind, again, whether or not this is happening in
humans, I don't know, but then you think about the perfume thing, and
here people are putting these scents on themselves that contain
putative pheromones, human pheromones, and walking around hoping that
their scents are going to evoke mate-seeking behavior from other
individuals of the same human species, so we are among the animals in
this behavior, independent of whether or not you believe pheromone
effects exist. So let's get back to behaviors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=2613"&gt;Apnea: A Powerful Bi-Directional Influence On Estrogen &amp;amp; Testosterone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that can help optimize hormone levels. One of the main behaviors
that's been shown to be associated with poor levels of estrogen
relative to age-match controls for people with ovaries or lower levels
of testosterone compared to age-match controls for people with testes,
is apnea, apnea has everything to do with under-breathing and the
buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body, there are other
effects of apnea as well, but if there's a consistent literature in
this whole story about aging and reductions in hormones and general
health and reductions in hormones, it's apnea. I went deep into the
literature on advanced menopause, or when menopausal symptoms are
exacerbated, and I went into the literature on andropause, or early-
onset andropause, or levels of testosterone that are far lower than
they should be for a given age, and in every case, you could find
multiple papers that show that apnea, or poor efficiency of breathing
and buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body was a problem,
mostly sleep apnea, although apnea in general was shown to be an issue
negatively impacting hormones. Now, the directionality of this effect
isn't entirely clear, it could be that reductions in estrogen cause
apnea, and actually, there's some reason to believe that might be the
case, I found at least one paper showing that there are estrogen
receptors on some of the neurons that actually innervate the lungs and
allow for the perception of how full or empty the lungs are, in other
words, reductions in estrogen may adjust breathing by changing our
sensitivity to our own lungs, now, that was true for males and
females, remember, estrogen is both males and females, but as well, I
found papers in which testosterone reductions were associated with
apnea, and testosterone receptors are also found on a lot of cells in
the so-called viscera, including the lungs, so again, the
directionality of the effect isn't clear, but what's really
interesting is that there are very clear ways in which patterns of
breathing, especially patterns of breathing in sleep, can modulate
hormones in ways that are immediately actionable and can serve to
optimize both estrogen and testosterone regardless of whether or not
you have ovaries or testes. So what is apnea? Apnea is under-
breathing, or mainly, cessation of breathing during sleep, so people
are holding their breath, and then they'll suddenly wake up, and
actually I've talked about the physiological sigh on previous episodes
of this podcast, of this pattern of double inhales followed by exhales
that one can do consciously to reduce stress and anxiety and offload
carbon dioxide, that pattern of breathing is actually what kicks in
spontaneously anytime we have an apnea episode in sleep, although in
many people who have apnea, they don't engage the physiological sigh.
People who are dramatically overweight also suffer a lot from apnea
during sleep, there's actually a lot of buildup of carbon dioxide in
the body, and that can lead to excessive sleepiness during the day,
inability to access the deeper phases of sleep, and it's well-
established that going into deep sleep and getting the proper patterns
of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep are important for hormone
optimization. I talked about how to modulate sleep and optimize sleep
in the first month of the "Huberman Lab Podcast," so please check out
those episodes if you have sleep issues or you want to work on your
sleep, also check out Matt Walker's terrific book, "Why We Sleep," and
that will help you find various protocols to help you optimize your
sleep, but the issue of breathing itself can be adjusted in the
daytime waking hours in ways that can powerfully impact both sleep,
reduce incidents of sleep apnea, and apparently from some emerging
literature, can also help to optimize various hormones even just by
breathing in particular ways while awake. So here's how this works,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=2864"&gt;Mouth vs. Nose Breathing &amp;amp; Hormone Levels: Effects Via Sleep and Direct Effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there's now a lot of literature showing that breathing through the
nose, not through the mouth, is powerful for improving lots of things,
first of all, it improves cosmetic features of the jaw and face, this
was first well-established by my colleagues at Stanford in a book
called "Jaws: The Story of a Hidden Epidemic," this is by Sandra Kahn
and Paul Ehrlich, who are both faculty at Stanford, has a forward by
Robert Sapolsky, the great Robert Sapolsky, and it also has a heavy
endorsement upfront by Jared Diamond, the author of "Guns, Germs, and
Steel," the Pulitzer winner, so a lot of heavy hitters on this book,
"Jaws." It's not a book that a lot of people know about,
unfortunately, but it really describes the benefits of nasal breathing
and the terrible things that happen when people, in particular
children, but adults also, are heavy mouth-breathers, so mouth-
breathers have changes in the cosmetics of their face and jaw that are
really bad in terms of attractiveness, and this was done in twin
studies, you can look in the book and see some of this, it's really
dramatic how being a mouth-breather tends to make the chin drop back
behind the upper mandible, there's a lengthening in the face, a
drooping of the eyes, it can be quite dramatic or modest depending on
how much mouth-breathing. Now, sometimes we have to breathe with our
mouths, but there's also a lot of data and studies described in this
book, "Jaws," that describe how nose-breathing in wakefulness and in
sleep promotes all sorts of positive things related to not just
cosmetics, but also the improvement of gas exchange of carbon dioxide
and oxygen in the body, and as well, it can modify levels of different
neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in ways that positively can
impact hormones, so believe it or not, being a nasal-breather and
avoiding being a mouth-breather can actually positively impact
hormones, and in particular, the hormones testosterone and estrogen,
although the way that it does that is by making you a better sleeper,
which allows you to produce more testosterone and the appropriate
amounts of testosterone and estrogen, but it does that in part through
indirect mechanisms because deep sleep supports the gonads, the
ovaries and the testicles and their turnover of cells and the
production of cells, remember, in the ovary, particular cells and the
egg follicles themselves make estrogen, and in the testicle, that the
sertoli cells and the Leydig cells are important for the formation of
sperm and for testosterone, respectively. So what does this all mean?
This means we have to be breathing properly, it almost sounds kind of
like, kind of new-agey, like, oh, you have to breathe properly to get
your hormones right, but no, you have to breathe properly to get your
breathing and sleep right so that your sleep can actually be deep
enough and you're not entering apnea states, and then that will
support gonad function, and I wouldn't be putting this out as one of
the main behavioral tools upfront if it weren't for the fact that the
effects of apnea on these hormones are dramatic and terrible, and the
positive effects of getting breathing right on these hormones,
testosterone and estrogen, are dramatic and wonderful, so let's talk
about a few of those studies briefly so I can underscore the value of
proper breathing in order to optimize hormones. So I was able to find
at least four quality studies showing that when apnea is reduced in
sleep, or eliminated, there are significant increases in testosterone
in males and in proper estrogen to testosterone ratios in females,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=3071"&gt;How Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone and Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the way that it works is very interesting, apparently, it works by
reductions in cortisol, now, cortisol is a stress hormone that is
released early in the day as we wake up and serves healthy roles in
protecting us against infection, reducing inflammation, et cetera, but
you don't want cortisol to be too high, and you certainly don't want
it elevated too long throughout the day and night, and so we all know,
because now we've been told a lot in the last decade or so, that
getting proper sleep is important for all these aspects of health,
getting proper sleep can really offset all the reductions in
testosterone and estrogen and reductions in fertility that occur if we
don't get enough sleep, but seldom is it discussed how sleep actually
adjusts things like testosterone and estrogen, and it does it by
modifying cortisol, so the molecule cholesterol can be converted into
testosterone or estrogen, but there's a competition whereby the
cholesterol will turn into cortisol and not testosterone, or it'll
turn into cortisol and not estrogen if stress levels are too high, so
the simple version of this is getting your breathing right during the
waking hours, meaning primarily, unless you're working out really hard
or there's some other reason why, you're maybe eating or speaking,
that you need to be breathing through your mouth, you should be a
nose-breather, there's really good evidence for that now, and in
sleep, you also want to be a nose-breather because that's going to
increase the amount of oxygen that you're bringing into your system
and the amount of carbon dioxide that you're offloading, there are
other positive effects of it as well, but you're basically reducing
apnea, breath-holding in sleep leads to buildup of carbon dioxide and
leads to increases in cortisol, which then decrease testosterone and
decrease estrogen in negative ways across all sexes, okay? So the
simple version of this is get your breathing right, so how do you do
that, how do you get your breathing right? Well, for some people that
have severe sleep apnea, they are going to need the CPAP machine, this
is a machine that you actually put on your face and it helps you
breathe properly in sleep. Many people, however, are starting to do
this thing of taping their mouths shut, now, this sounds a little bit
extreme, and you certainly don't want to do this in any way that's
dangerous. James Nestor talked about this in his book, "Breath: The
New Science of a Lost Art," that simply taping shut the mouth, with
some tape that will allow you to open your mouth if you really need
to, during sleep can allow people to shift over from being mouth-
breathers and snorers to nose-breathers. In the daytime, the best way
to get good at nasal-breathing is to dilate the nasal passages, 'cause
a lot of people have a hard time breathing through their nose,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=3229"&gt;02:CO2 Ratios, Nasal Breathing During Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and one way to do this is to just breathe through your nose more, and
one way to do that is when you exercise, in particular, cardiovascular
exercise, most of the time, provided you're not in maximum effort, you
should be nasal-breathing. Now, for a lot of people, nasal-breathing
during exercise is hard at first, but as you do it, because the
sinuses have a capacity to dilate over time, you'll get better at it,
the sinuses, if you haven't ever held a skull for, because of my job
as a neuroscientist, I've held a lot of skulls, taken a lot of brains
out of a lot of skulls, I teach neuroanatomy, and I've done that for,
goodness, god knows how many species I've done that for, including
human, but what the sinuses are is they're actually, what you've got
are you got these little portals in the bone that run, you know, up
here and down here, behind the nose and into the jaw, if you ever had
a cold and your sinuses are stuffed up, you feel like you have
congestion here and here and around your ears and in your cheeks and
in your face, and that's because the sinuses are actually portals
where the bones are fused together and interdigitated like this, but
they're lined, of course, with mucus membranes, and as you start to
nasal-breathe more, the nasal passages will start to dilate more,
don't worry, you're not going to get giant nostrils, but what's going
to end up happening is you're going to have an easier time breathing
through your nose just from waking, so my advice would be breathe
through your nose while exercising unless you're in maximum effort,
pretty soon, what you'll find is you actually can create more output
than you would if you were breathing through your mouth, and of
course, there are exceptions to this, if you're swimming, follow that
breath protocol, for fighters and martial artists, there's reason to
do the kind of exhale breathing through the mouth, that shh kind of
thing, you know, there are reasons to do that sort of thing for
particular sports, but for most people who are kind of recreational
athletes or exercisers, learn to be a nasal-breather, it has positive
cosmetic effects, it reduces apnea, it offloads more carbon dioxide,
it increases lung capacity, it dilates the sinuses, and it prevents
apnea in sleep, so unless you have severe apnea and you need the CPAP,
becoming a nasal-breather can have all sorts of positive effects by
reducing cortisol, reducing apnea, and indirectly, raising
testosterone and estrogen in the proper ratios, so this might seem
kind of foundational and indirect, but when you go into the scientific
literature, it comes through as one of the most powerful things that
you can do that is zero cost, takes a little effort but it's zero
cost, and it has all of these positive effects across the board, you
know, both cosmetic and in sleep and hormonal, et cetera, so that's
the first piece of behavioral advice. The second piece of behavioral
advice relates to the viewing of light,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=3390"&gt;Light Viewing Patterns &amp;amp; Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and many of you have heard me talk about this before, and I'm not
going to belabor the point that viewing bright light within the first
hour of waking, whether or not it's from artificial light or ideally,
from sunlight, has these powerful effects on sleep and wakefulness,
but we have to return to this if you want to understand how light can
impact hormones because hormones, light, and dopamine have a very
close-knit relationship, so much so that your light-viewing behavior
can actually have a direct effect on hormone levels and fertility, it
can have a direct effect on hormone levels and libido, it can have a
direct effect on hormone levels and your ability to heal quickly, and
I'm not talking about shining light on particular injuries, that may
or may not have positive effects, we can argue about that on a
subsequent episode, it may, but what I'm talking about is viewing
light with your eyes, so let's talk about that now because the
scientific literature on this are robust and they extend back several
decades, and yet, I think most people don't really understand how
powerful this relationship is between light, dopamine, hormones, and
all the great things that the sex steroid hormones do when they're
available in your body in the proper ratios. In order to understand
the powerful effects that light can have on the sex steroid hormones,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=3464"&gt;Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we need to understand seasonal breeding animals, now, humans are not
seasonal breeders, but if you understand the biology of how light
impacts various neurotransmitters and hormones, you'll set yourself up
for a deep understanding of what you should do with your light-viewing
behavior. So several species of animals, many species of animals, in
fact, like rabbits and fox, and various mustelids, like ferrets and
ermines, change their pellage color across the seasons, this might be
kind of a duh, but fox in winter are often white or light gray, and
those same animals will be brown or darker-colored in the summertime
and spring months. Now, those same animals breed in the spring, and
they shut down breeding, they actually shut down ovulation, they often
shut down testosterone production in the winter months, so right now
I'm just correlating color of fur with tendency to breed, tendency to
breed, as we know, is going to be related to the levels of sex steroid
hormones, estrogen and testosterone. Now, why would these two things
be linked? Well, it turns out that dopamine is the link between them,
so dopamine has a precursor, that precursor is tyrosine, which is
amino acid, comes from food, and when dopamine levels are high, as I
mentioned before, there's a tendency for more gonadotropin-releasing
hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, all the
hormones that come from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and stimulate
estrogen and testosterone release from the ovary and testes, dopamine
basically increases all of that. The precursor to dopamine is
tyrosine, but the precursor to a lot of the melanin-producing elements
of cells that give pigmentation, including for the hair, is tyrosine
and tyrosinase, an enzyme, so yes, the same amino acid-based pathway,
and many of the same enzymes that are devoted to dopamine and dopamine
increasing the sex steroid hormones are devoted to giving pigmentation
to the hair and skin, and this is why in the summer months, when days
are longer, animals are breeding more, and this is also why in the
winter months when days are shorter, animals are breeding less, this
is also why in humans, many people, not all, feel an elevation in mood
in the spring and summer months because of the amount of sunlight
they're getting is increased relative to the winter months. Now, some
of you may be saying, "I love the fall, I love the winter,"
sensitivity to light in these dopamine systems has a strong genetic
component, so you go to some areas of the world, I have relatives who
are Scandinavian, and in some areas of Scandinavia, people know that
there's a kind of seasonal affective disorder, there's kind of a
seasonal depression and people get sadder and more quiescent in the
winter, there's actually less going out, and therefore, there's less
sexual behavior, there's less partying and things of that sort, but
other people will say, "No, during the winter months, I feel great
"and I love the holidays around winter," et cetera, so there's a lot
of variation, but in general, the pathway is the following, increased
viewing of sunlight, and it has to be to the eyes, it's not to the
skin, increased viewing of sunlight increases dopamine levels in the
brain, increased dopamine levels in animals and humans increases the
amount of these melanocytes and the activity of these melanin-
producing cells, which give pigmentation to the skin and hair, and
indirectly, increase the amount of testosterone and estrogen, and
thereby, reproductive behavior, feelings of well-being, social
interactions, reductions in anxiety, et cetera, all of which should
make sense based on what we've talked about already in terms of the
biology and the impact of these steroid hormones on various aspects of
the mind and body. So how does this translate to a protocol? This
translates to the protocol of, if you want to optimize testosterone
and estrogen, you need to get your light-viewing behavior correct,
it's not just about optimizing your sleep, which is also important,
it's about getting sufficient amount of light in your eyes so you have
sufficient levels of dopamine, so the simple protocols for that I've
reviewed before, but it means getting anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes of
bright light exposure in your eyes early in the day, it is not
sufficient to do this with sunglasses unless you have to do that for
safety reasons, it's fine to wear prescription lenses and contacts, if
you can't get sunlight for whatever reason, you want to use bright
artificial light, but that is absolutely critical for timing the
cortisol release properly, limiting cortisol release to the early part
of the day, getting increases in dopamine that are going to promote
the production of testosterone and estrogen to healthy levels, the
other aspect of light-viewing behavior that's extremely important is
to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the
night, if you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night, you
are suppressing dopamine release, if you're suppressing dopamine
release, you are suppressing testosterone levels so much so that I
would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation on reducing
testosterone and estrogen is not necessarily because of the lack of
sleep per se, it's because usually when people are not getting enough
sleep, they're getting too much light in their eyes in the middle of
the night as well, a study on this has not been completed yet, but
there are two studies published in "Cell" and "Neuron," both Cell
Press journals, excellent journals, showing that viewing bright light
with the eyes in the middle of the circadian night has a detrimental
effect on dopamine, and therefore has a detrimental effect on things
like testosterone and estrogen, so you can't even begin to talk about
supplements and other ways to optimize testosterone, diet and its
effects on testosterone and estrogen and fertility and reproductive
behavior, et cetera, until you get your breathing right, until you get
things like your light-viewing behavior right, so bright light early
in the day and throughout the day is great, view as much bright light,
ideally sunlight, as you can, as much as you safely can, you obviously
don't want to burn your retinas or damage your retinas, so never look
at any light that's so bright it's painful to look at, but getting a
lot of light in your eyes is not just about adjusting your sleep-wake
rhythms, it's also about optimizing your sex steroid hormones, and
avoiding bright light in the middle of the night is not just about not
disrupting your sleep, it's also about optimizing the sex steroid
hormones, and now that you understand a bit of how the sex steroid
hormones work and how powerful they are for reducing anxiety and all
these other effects, this should be straightforward to do, or
hopefully it's inspired you to get your light-viewing behavior and
your breathing behavior correct. In fact, in thinking about tools, for
many people that are suffering from low levels of estrogen if they
want higher levels or low levels of testosterone if they want higher
levels, just getting the breathing and light-viewing behavior, which
will indirectly support sleep behavior, can be a huge and positive
effect on levels of sex steroid hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=3879"&gt;Specificity of Hormone Effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already anticipate that in hearing this, you might wonder
whether or not viewing light is going to, for instance, increase your
testosterone a lot when in fact you want your estrogen increased, or
it's going to increase your estrogen a lot when you want your
testosterone increased, everything I'm describing here is for people,
regardless of chromosomal or gonadal background, so I'm trying to
basically offer all this information in one swoop, but basically, if
you're somebody who naturally has ovaries and has higher levels of
estrogen than testosterone, then viewing bright light early in the
day, because of dopamine's effects, is going to promote more estrogen
and subtle increases in testosterone, whereas if you're somebody who
starts off with more testosterone and lower estrogen, so somebody
presumably who has testes or maybe you're supplementing with
testosterone through other sources for whatever reason, bright-light
viewing is going to increase testosterone and estrogen in parallel,
but you're still going to maintain the ratio of testosterone to
estrogen, in short, you don't have to worry that you're going to
increase the wrong hormone, this is all about optimizing the ratios of
hormones that you already have. Okay, so we've talked about breathing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=3963"&gt;Temperature: Cold &amp;amp; Hot Gonads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we've talked about light, let's talk about a third element that there
seems to be some excitement about lately for other reasons but that
can actually have some pretty profound influences on hormone levels,
and that's heat and cold, so as always, rather than just offer a tool,
I'm going to tell you the underlying science as it relates to
naturally occurring phenomena because, in understanding that and
understanding the mechanism, you're going to be in a far better
position to understand the tools and mechanisms and how you might want
to adjust them for your own life. So now you understand the
relationship between light, day length, dopamine, and hormone levels,
and everyone should realize that temperature and day length are
linked, and I'm sure as I say that, you're probably thinking, "Oh, of
course." In summer, when there's more sunlight, days are longer,
nights are shorter, in general, it tends to be warmer out, and in
winter, when nights are longer, days are shorter, it tends to be
colder out, and in the winter months, testosterone and estrogen tend
to be lower in many animals and in humans, and in the summer months,
because of the role of dopamine in promoting the sex steroid hormones,
when days are longer and it's warmer, humans tend to make more
estrogen and testosterone relative to the other months of the year.
Now, these effects can be somewhat weak and modulated as opposed to in
seasonally breeding animals where they're really dramatic, okay? But
the point is that temperature and day length and sunlight, those are
all intimately related because of the systems that we evolved in,
right? So before we had artificial light and artificial heating and
artificial cooling, our biology evolved under systems where
temperature, day length, and the hormones were correlated with one
another, so nowadays, there's a lot of interest in using cold as a way
to stimulate testosterone, this is mainly because in the sports
community, in particular, in the bodybuilding community, they are
always seeking ways to maximize testosterone, dihydrotestosterone,
keep estrogen to its minimum required to still have a libido and still
have skin elasticity but also walk around with Saran-wrap skin, then
all this kind of extreme stuff that happens there has led to a recent
movement where, believe it or not, I heard this and I couldn't believe
it, I went and checked, but although I didn't buy them, that on
Amazon, you can actually find, they're literally underwear that have
ice packs, so I think they are ice pack underwear, so that people are
making themselves cold at the level of the gonads in order to try and
increase testosterone and libido, sounds pretty crazy, but believe it
or not, that and things like ice baths and cold showers can have
positive effects on the sex steroid hormones, both testosterone,
mainly in males, and estrogen, mainly in females, and you might say,
"Wait, I thought cold "makes the reproductive axis kind of shut down a
bit "or reduces testosterone and estrogen," but it turns out it's not
actually the cold that's having these effects in people, things like
the ice bath, cold showers, cold-water swims, these ice underwear or
whatever they are, can't believe that these actually exist, but they
do exist, what happens is there's a rebound in vasodilation after
cooling, so cooling causes vasoconstriction, and then after the
cooling, there's a rebound vasodilation and there's more infusion of
blood into the gonads. There's also an effect that's neural, so let me
explain how this works because there are only a few studies on this,
none of which looking at the frozen underwear, but that have looked at
cold exposure and levels of androgens and estrogens, and it's kind of
interesting, so you have to remember that the gonad, the ovaries and
the testes are heavily vascularized. Remember, even at the level of
the brain, GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, comes from neurons
that, believe it or not, start off in your nose early in development,
migrate into the hypothalamus. I'm not making that up, they started
off in your nose and migrated to the hypothalamus. Those neurons
extend processes, we call them axons, into the pituitary and release
GnRH into the pituitary. There's a lot of vascularization within the
pituitary, so now those hormones, or GnRH, can stimulate follicle-
stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, which then are released and
travel into the bloodstream. Then those hormones reach the ovary or
testes, and they have to get into the ovary and testes, and the way
they do that is through the vascular system, and people forget, but
the vascular system and how constricted or dilated vessels are is
controlled by neurons, all right? We discussed this during the
discussion about stress in the stress episode, but it's well-known to
neuroscientists that the best way to shut down neurons is to cool
them, so there are a lot of examples of this in the scientific
literature, but most people aren't aware of it because you're not
digging around in the method section of these papers, but when we want
to shut down neurons, we can do things like inject drugs that will do
that, like lidocaine, you know, the stuff that makes you numb at the
dentist, or you can use different inhibitors, but one of the best ways
to do it experimentally is to just cool neurons, when you make neurons
cold, because there's a temperature dependence of when neurons can be
active and when they can't, the neurons shut down, so the most
plausible explanation for why cold exposure, either through 1 to
10-minute ice bath or cold shower or the ice underpants thing, would
increase testosterone or increase estrogen is that you're cooling the
neurons that control vasoconstriction and vasodilation and shutting
down the entry of blood, or at least reducing it, and hormones into
the gonad, and then when the gonad and the surrounding area heats up
again, you're getting a rebound hyper-vasodilation that delivers
excessive levels of, not excessive, but increased levels of GnRH and
other hormones and carriers and carrier proteins and so forth that
would then stimulate the gonad to release more testosterone or would
stimulate the gonad to release more estrogen, that's the most
plausible explanation I can come up with, there aren't a lot of
studies looking at direct effects of temperature on the gonad, and
it's going to be a difficult study to carry out in any case because
unless it were done in vitro in a dish, it's very hard to eliminate
all the other things like vasoconstriction and vasodilation, put
simply, we don't know whether or not cold and heat directly affect the
production of testosterone and estrogen, we only know that cold and
heat can modulate those, probably through indirect mechanisms like
controlling the amount of blood flow by way of shutting down or
activating the neurons. Now, there's a lot of lore around heating up
the gonads too much, there's actually a whole set of pseudoscience
webpages out there saying, "Well, if you want a girl, "you should
conceive the child at this room temperature, "and if you want a boy,
"you should conceive the child at this room temperature." I don't
think there's really any firm scientific evidence for that, for either
one, but there's some interesting literature about temperature
dependence of production of hormones, and I think that it probably
relates to these mechanisms of vasodilation and neural control over
vasodilation, and of course, excessively high heat is not good for the
testes, for sperm production, or for sperm health, sperm have all
sorts of proteins in the cap, things like pentraxins and other things
that cause them to swim faster when they're expressed properly and in
the right locations, and heat actually alters the location and the
function of a lot of those proteins, they're very heat sensitive, and
so that's why excessive heat is truly not good for fertility, which
may be independent of heat's roles in promoting estrogen or
testosterone. Okay, so now we've talked about breathing, light, and
temperature, we talked about parenthood, we talked about competition,
and we talked about some pheromone effects,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=4450"&gt;How To Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now let's talk about particular forms of exercise and how they
modulate the steroid hormones, and then we're going to talk about
various supplements, both in reference to testosterone and in
reference to estrogen. So now let's talk about how exercise in its
various forms, weight training, endurance work, weight training to
failure, or less intense weight training can impact testosterone
levels, but I want to remind you that we're talking about testosterone
both in males and females, and based on what you know from earlier in
the episode, testosterone can have numerous positive effects in both
males and females provided they're in optimal range. So if you look on
the web, people will say, "Oh, you know, "testosterone is increased by
weight training, "you want to do these big, heavy compound movements,"
squats and deadlifts and chins and things of that sort, but what about
the scientific studies? Like, what's the actual basis for this?
Because if you just take a step back and look at this from the
perspective of a scientist, you'd say, okay, what is a squat? A squat
is loading up a bunch of weights on a bar and then, you know, sitting
down, essentially, and standing up over and over again. What's a
deadlift? It's lifting heavy weights from the ground. Why would that
increase testosterone, right? This is what's often not discussed in
the weight training or even the exercise science community, what would
actually stimulate the release of testosterone from the adrenals
and/or testes, and which one is it, adrenals or testes or both? And
that's often not discussed, but as a neuroscientist, these are the
kinds of things we think about because we think always that genes
don't create behavior, immune systems don't know when to be activated,
lungs don't know when to inhale or exhale, hearts don't know when to
beat except for the information that it gets from neurons, the nervous
system controls all of that, and so really the answer has to be in the
neural system that's related to these particular types of weight-
bearing exercises. So when you go into this literature, it's kind of
hard to find real mechanism, you see a lot of effects, you'll hear
things like, androgen receptor content, meaning testosterone and its
derivatives, receptor content following heavy-resistance exercise, and
you'll find some examples that, for instance, you know, they do muscle
biopsies, they can actually see receptor increases, looking at either
high-volume or low-volume really intense exercise, and you can find a
lot of that but not a lot of mechanism about how the nervous system
would do this, and the reason you'd want to know how it can do it is
that you could potentially build better protocols or figure out
exactly what about these movements is triggering increases in androgen
receptors and testosterone. So what's interesting is when you start
digging into the more mechanistic studies, what you find is that heavy
weight training, so this is weight training where the sets are done
with anywhere from kind of one to eight rep range, and this translates
differently depending on ratio of muscle fiber type and so forth, but
where basically people are working at anywhere from like, 70% to 95%
of their maximum, or sometimes even going right down to their one-
repetition maximum, really kind of max effort, what you find is that
using the nervous system in a way in which they're moving heavy loads,
so that I would translate to recruitment of high-threshold motor
units, for you muscle physiologists, and there's a rule in muscle
physiology about the neuron recruitment for moving muscles where you
basically use the minimum number of motor units of neurons to activate
muscle as you possibly can, as loads increase, you have to recruit
more and more neurons, you always hear about recruiting muscle fibers,
but really, it's recruiting more neurons to recruit more muscle
fibers, and what you find is that heavy weight training, but not
weight training to failure where completion of a repetition is
impossible, leads to the greatest increases in testosterone. Now, I'm
sure there are a bunch of exercise jockeys out there that are going to
come at me with a bunch of things where, oh, yeah, but high volume and
this, and training to failure and that, sure, if you're willing to
kind of put things side by side, adjust for exogenous testosterone
treatment and all the rest, which was done in these studies, what you
find in general is that weight training with heavy loads, so anywhere
from one-rep maximum to somewhere in the six to eight repetition
range, in males or females, increases testosterone significantly, and
it does it for about a day, sometimes up to 48 hours, and the studies
that I found which seem to hold the most rigor or weight based on
where they're published as opposed to being published in the journal
of "Never Heard of It," they're published in good-quality exercise
physiology journals, for instance, the paper by Ratamess, R-A-T-A-M-E-
S-S et al., which was published in 2005, which talks about modulations
in androgen receptor content after heavy resistance exercise, looks at
going to failure and not to failure, the work of Izquierdo et al.
published in 2006, "Differential Effects of Strength Training "Leading
to Failure Versus Not Failure "on Hormonal Responses, Strength, and
Power Gains," you know, there are a lot of studies here and I will
certainly put the links to these in the caption, many of these
actually include Duncan French, who runs the UFC training center who
I've had the privilege of meeting and discussing some of this with
before, as well as other authors, of course, but they all point to the
fact that there's something about the engagement of the neurons that
recruit high-threshold motor units in muscle when moving heavy loads,
but not to failure, that has to provide some sort of feedback signal,
either to the gonad to produce more testosterone, or is increasing the
activity of receptors in the body. Now, why do I say that? Well, this
is the puzzle, right? How is it that a particular movement, just like
how is it that interacting with your child, is increasing or
decreasing testosterone? This is the kind of fundamental question at
the mechanistic level, and we answered the question for child-rearing,
it has probably something to do with smell and pheromones, although
I'm sure there are other cues as well, but there's clearly a influence
of hard work at the neural level and then at the muscular level for
increasing testosterone, and there's also clearly an effect of working
too hard and presumably increasing cortisol too much, although I'm
speculating there, in terms of reducing testosterone, and so the
reason we're getting nitty-gritty about this is because ultimately,
we'd really like to understand, what are the optimal protocols? You
know, out there in the literature, you hear, move heavy objects to
increase testosterone, some of that will be converted to the more
powerful androgen, DHT, by 5-alpha reductase et cetera, but we really
don't understand yet how these particular behaviors increase
testosterone and whether or not it's doing that by modulating the
receptors or it's modulating testosterone release directly,
presumably, testosterone release directly and sensitivity of the
receptors, that what most of the muscle physiology studies that I was
able to find point to, but this basically boils down to a particular
set of protocols where if you want to increase testosterone, for
whatever reason, that weight training with heavy loads but not to
failure seems to be the best-supported, at least scientifically
supported, solution to that, now, it may not raise your testosterone
levels as high as you want, but it's definitely taking things in the
correct direction. Now, many of you might be endurance athletes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=4902"&gt;Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First or Last?) Yes, It Matters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or also enjoy exercise besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise, and
there are several studies exploring whether or not endurance activity
can increase or decrease androgen levels and whether or not you
combine endurance activity and weight training, whether or not that
has any effect if you do the endurance activity first or second, and
the takeaway from all of this was that endurance activity, if
performed first, leads to decreases in testosterone during the weight
training session as compared to the same weight training session done
first followed by endurance activity, in other words, if you want to
optimize testosterone levels, it seems to be the case that weight
training first and doing cardio-type endurance activity afterward is
the right order of business. Now, when these are done on separate
days, it doesn't seem to have an effect, they showed no statistical
interaction, but it seems that if you're going to do these in the same
workout episode that it's move heavy loads first, then do
cardiovascular exercise, so there's a little bit of data looking
specifically at how endurance exercise impacts testosterone and its
derivatives, and it's very clear that high-intensity interval
training, sprinting et cetera, which somewhat mimics the neural
activity that occurs while moving heavy weight loads, is going to
increase testosterone and there's ample evidence for that in the
literature, and that endurance exercise that extends beyond 75 minutes
is going to start to lead to reductions in testosterone, presumably by
increases in cortisol, but of course, the intensity of the exercise is
going to be important too, you know, I don't think anyone really
believes that hiking for three hours is going to reduce your
testosterone, whereas I think if one were to go out and run hard for
three hours that you can imagine there'd be reductions in testosterone
by way of increases in cortisol, and so while this area certainly
needs more research, it's pretty clear that limiting the endurance
exercise to 75 minutes or less, not making it too intense, is one way
to keep cortisol from going through the roof, but I've talked on
previous episodes, and there are a lot of others who have talked out
there about how to clamp cortisol, how to keep cortisol more reduced,
this is also one of the reasons why, you can imagine, that various
individuals, either for competition or just for their own purposes,
rely on testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just for
weight training, but for endurance exercise, so this is one of the
reasons why every once in a while, professional cyclists will get
popped for performance-enhancing drugs, meaning they'll get caught,
and it's not just that they're increasing red blood cells through EPO
and things of that sort, oftentimes they're also taking testosterone
not because they want to be large or have massively hypertrophied
muscles, but because they're injecting testosterone, they don't have
to worry about cortisol-induced reductions in testosterone, and they
can just clamp, or keep their testosterone levels high, not something
I'm recommending, but I'm just justifying the rationale for why an
endurance athlete would want to do that at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=5081"&gt;Estrogen &amp;amp; Menopause: Compounds That May Ameliorate/Reverse Symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now let's switch over to talking about estrogen, so there are many
people who are trying to optimize their estrogen levels, and one of
the places where this shows up a lot and I get a lot of questions
about is menopause, so menopause, as I mentioned earlier, is this
fairly massive reduction in the amount of estrogen that is circulating
in one's blood mainly because the ovary is now depleted of some
estrogen production of its own, the eggs are not being produced,
they've been depleted, et cetera. So menopause is characterized by a
variety of symptoms, and it's multifaceted, probably deserves an
entire episode on its own, but things like hot flashes, things like
mood swings, things like headaches, in particular migraine headaches,
there can be a lot of brain fog, it can be very, very disruptive for
people. Now, you sometimes hear about andropause, which is thought to
be the kind of analog to menopause, but menopause has certain
characteristics that make it a very robust phenomenon for most women,
whereas for men, andropause is going to sometimes happen, sometimes
won't, in fact, without going into the details of the graphs and the
data, it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier, that some men maintain
levels of circulating androgens that are quite high, even as similar
as they were in puberty and their teen years and 20s, well into their
60s, 70s, and 80s if they're optimizing a lot of other things, and
probably genetics plays a role as well, whereas some males won't, but
within the female population, or population of individuals that have
ovaries, there's a very stereotyped and characteristic reduction in
estrogen levels as the number of eggs becomes depleted, and that's
what we think of as menopause. So what are the various things that one
can do for menopause? Well, one of the most common ones is that
physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen, so this is hormone
therapy where somebody takes either their oral estrogen or they'll use
a patch or a pellet, some way to secrete estradiol into the system,
and that has varying success depending on the individual, some people
respond very well to it, other people really have challenges with it,
and there are a lot of side effects associated with it for some
people, not others, in addition, there's a concern always about
supplementing estrogen when there's a breast cancer background in the
family or there's concern about breast cancer for any reason because a
lot of those cancers are estrogen-dependent, and that's why drugs like
tamoxifen and anastrozole and drugs that block either aromatase or
block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly were initially
developed, you see them a lot on the internet, again, for all the
sports folks who are trying to increase testosterone, reduce estrogen,
but remember, those drugs were initially developed as ways to prevent
estrogen binding to the estrogen receptor as cancer treatments, so I
want to be very clear and I've said this many times, we always put it
in the caption of each episode, of course, that I'm not a physician,
I'm not an M.D., I don't prescribe anything, I'm a professor and I
profess things, I'm here to translate the scientific literature and
point to what might be some useful avenues for exploration, but this
is just for information purposes, you should definitely talk to your
doctor about anything that I'm talking about now or in any episode,
for that matter. So if you look at the literature on menopause outside
of just standard estrogen therapy, there are some very interesting
compounds out there that have been used and that are supported by
quality peer-reviewed studies, and again, I'll refer you once again to
this amazing website, examine.com, where you can put in essentially
any condition or any supplement, and it will point you to the human
effect matrix, not animal studies, but human studies that have
explored these things. Now, there are a huge variety of them here so I
won't go into all of them, but some of the pro-estrogenic compounds
that have been shown to be powerful in the context of menopause, as
well as other conditions where estrogen is lower than one would like,
include a description in some of the literature, I'll get into this in
a moment, of something like black cohosh, I think that's the correct
pronunciation, it's literally the word black and then C-O-H-O-S-H, and
it's very interesting, there are 13 peer-reviewed studies that have
reached prominence in the kind of commercial landscape where this
substance, black cohosh, has been promoted as a way to increase
estrogen, turns out that the effects are consistent but are fairly
minor, fairly minor increases in estrogen, so it does seem to be a
real effect, it is significant over the placebo effect, but there's
also a significant placebo effect in some of these studies as well, so
what's interesting when you look at these studies is that many of them
were carried out over a period of six-plus months, they're double-
blind studies, et cetera, and almost all of them lead to modest
increases in estrogen and modest decreases in menopause-related
symptoms. Now, a few additional details about these studies, they were
generally carried out on women age 45 to 64, in some cases, they look
specifically at women that were clinically obese or overweight,
although not always, the subject size pools are pretty big, you know,
anywhere from 50 to 87, these are decent size, 132 subjects, et
cetera, so these look to be like quality studies, and they basically
point to the fact that black cohosh can have a modest effect in
improving menopause symptoms. The other one is Panax ginseng, so P-N-
A-A-X ginseng, has been shown to decrease some symptoms associated
with menopause, mostly related to libido, although the other effects
were unreliable. Other things, like maca, which is known to increase
dopamine actually, had minor effects, things like, the names here are
a little hard to pronounce, so forgive me, things like Valeriana
officinalis has shown that there can be some improvement in the hot
flash symptoms and some of the insomnia associated with that, so that
might be worth exploring, again, discuss with your doctor, but these
were both 100-subject plus, age 45 to 64 individuals, double-blind
placebo-controlled studies that showed significant but modest effects.
There was one substance in the gallery of the compounds that was
looked at that turns out to be particularly interesting, and this one
is also particularly difficult to pronounce, and it's Pueraria
mirifica, so I'm going to spell this out for you, it's P-U-E-R-A-R-
I-A, Pueraria, mirifica, M-I-R-I-F-I-C-A, and there are four studies
on this compound that show, in every case, it to be very potent, in
fact, comparable to estrogen therapy, estrogen replacement therapy, in
reducing the symptoms of menopause, so this was pretty striking
because when you go through these studies and you look again that they
seem to be pretty well controlled, as far as I could tell, and they
explored a pretty wide subject pool, and it seems that every single
one of these studies, when looking side by side at Pueraria mirifica,
which is also called, now this is really hard to pronounce, Kwao Krua
Kao, I guess that's the name that they use in various countries, that
it was comparable to estrogen replacement therapy, so I mentioned this
because a lot of people contacted me and said, "What about the
insomnia in menopause? "What about the headaches in menopause?" Now,
I'm not suggesting you run out and immediately start taking any of
these compounds, please talk to your doctor, you know, any hormone-
related compound is a serious consideration because of the
relationship to breast cancers, but just in general, these compounds
are, estrogen and testosterone, are exceedingly powerful in terms of
controlling our mental and physical states, and so you want to
approach them with caution, but I thought that that one in particular
was interesting and for which there are quite a few PubMed-documented,
peer-reviewed studies in quality journals. Okay, so now let's talk
about the role of specific compounds, some of which, many of which can
be taken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=5598"&gt;Nutrients That Optimize The Foundation For Hormones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in supplementation form or extracted from diet and nutrition in order
to optimize sex steroid hormones, and again, I just want to emphasize
that I'm not suggesting anyone take anything or stop taking anything,
this is purely for informational purposes, but some of the data on
these is quite striking and impressive. It's very clear that certain
collections of nutrients are useful for promoting testosterone and
estrogen production in their proper ratios, and those things are what
I would call the sort of usual suspects, vitamin D, which is important
for so many biological functions, including endocrine functions, zinc,
magnesium, et cetera, and if you want to look into this more deeply
and you want to understand exactly what the negative effects are of
not having sufficient zinc and magnesium, and what those levels might
actually be, there's a paper that's available, you can go on PubMed, I
can't pronounce this last name, I'm sorry, it looks to me like
Wrzosek, but it's W-R-Z-O-S-E-K, I hope I didn't butcher that too
badly, Wrzosek et al. 2020 in "Endocrinology and Metabolism Review,"
so this is a recent paper in a good, peer-reviewed journal that talks
mainly about how the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sex
steroid hormones are negatively impacted by deficiencies in magnesium,
deficiencies in vitamin D, and deficiencies in zinc, however, that
doesn't point to the levels that one should take in order to optimize,
so it doesn't say take X amount of zinc or X amount of magnesium or X
amount of vitamin D, for that information, because it's so context-
dependent and individual-dependent, I highly recommend you go to
examine.com, you can put in zinc or magnesium or vitamin D, and they
will give you ranges of dosages that are supported by specific
studies, again, that information is completely free to you, and it's
very useful in figuring that out. I personally have supplemented with
zinc, magnesium, and vitamin D for years, but many other people do
that as well, and the question is always, how much? And that's why I'm
a proponent of getting blood work done because that's how you know
whether or not your androgen levels, as well as things like vitamin D
levels, et cetera, are sufficiently high, so the takeaway from these
studies looking at what deficiencies cause in terms of deficits in
testosterone and estrogen really point in the direction of, make sure
you're getting adequate zinc, magnesium, and D3 unless you want these
steroid hormone levels to be reduced for whatever reason. One of the
things that's been shown time and time again to have very negative
effects on sex steroid hormones, testosterone mainly men, estrogen
mainly in women, is opioids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=5760"&gt;Opioids as Severe Hormone Disruptors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's this whole issue, of course, of the opioid epidemic, it's
deserving of an entire episode, we are going to talk about that with
experts in addiction and people that treat pain and so forth, but the
opioids dramatically reduce levels of testosterone and estrogen, and
they do that mainly by disrupting the receptors on gonadotropin-
releasing hormone neurons, these neurons within the hypothalamus that
communicate to the pituitary, and in fact, people that take large
amounts of opioids, or even take low levels of opioids for long
periods of time, will develop all sorts of endocrine syndromes, that's
been shown over and over again, gynecomastia, or male breast
development in males, disruptions to the ovary in females, it's really
a quite terrible situation, so excessive opioids are very problematic
for sex steroid hormones, I don't think anyone will have any trouble
finding any literature on that, you can just go into PubMed, you can
put opioids, testosterone, or opioids, estrogen, but the major effect
is actually way up in the hypothalamus to shut down the production of
GnRH, the very hormone that stimulates testosterone and estrogen
release. Now, there's an entire industry devoted to supplements and
various things that people can take to increase testosterone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=5843"&gt;Testes, Antlers &amp;amp; Ovaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some of which have scientific data to support them, some of which do
not, and some of which have anecdotal support and some of which do
not. This ranges so broadly, I mean, things like the material off deer
antlers, which is high in, supposedly, IGF1, which is in the growth
hormone pathway, all the way to actual consumption of bull testes, you
can go on Amazon right now, I certainly don't suggest that you do
this, and you can actually buy ground up testes from cows, and you can
consume those, now, a lot of that's going to be broken down in the
gut, I'm certainly not suggesting you do that, but just the point out
this is a huge and vast literature, and it actually dates back
hundreds of years even though testosterone wasn't discovered that long
ago as a specific hormone molecule and characterized and then
resynthesized, it has a huge industry because of the powerful effects
that it has, likewise with estrogen, the development of the birth
control pill was only made possible by understanding the structure of
estrogen and estradiol, and we're going to talk all about birth
control and how it works and its influence on various other pathways
in a future episode, but there are these supplement compounds that are
supported by the scientific literature in terms of their ability to
adjust androgens, things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.
One of the ones that has really good evidence for it is creatine,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=5930"&gt;Creatine &amp;amp; Increasing DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's very clear that something about creatine, although the mechanism
isn't exactly clear, either increases 5-alpha reductase or makes the
testosterone molecule more susceptible to certain enzymatic reactions
that leads to increases in DHT, DHT, dihydrotestosterone, as I
mentioned in the previous episode, has this dramatic role in creating
a kind of masculinization of the brain prenatally, it also defines the
primary sex characteristic of the growth of the penis, et cetera, and
beyond infancy and early childhood and later in life, it has powerful
effects in creating balding, in beard growth, et cetera, and it has a
much higher affinity for the androgen receptor than does testosterone,
so creatine can increase DHT, which means that if you take creatine
and you're very DHT-susceptible, then you might experience some hair
loss, this has been heavily debated, does creatine cause baldness?
It's going to depend, it's going to depend on how much 5-alpha
reductase you have and how prone to hair loss you are, some people can
take creatine without any problem in terms of hair loss, some people
cannot, they start losing their hair to levels that, at least for
them, aren't comfortable. There are a few other things that can
increase testosterone and it has to do with the way that testosterone
exists in its free and its bound form,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=6014"&gt;Free and Bound Testosterone: SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), Tongat Ali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so testosterone, the molecule is kind of total testosterone, that's
usually what's measured, this is the kind of levels that are typically
thrown around of anywhere from 300 to 900 being the kind of natural
range, and then supraphysiological, getting up into 1,200, 1,600
range, but testosterone isn't just roaming around free in the blood,
at least most of it isn't, most of it is bound to either sex hormone
binding globulin, SHBG, or to albumin, they're needed as transporters
to get testosterone into cells so that testosterone can have its
effects on gene expression as well as other pathways within the cells,
so people talk about that the level of free testosterone is really
what's important and that you want to optimize free testosterone,
that's a little bit of a tricky statement, that's kind of like, it's
true, and yet, it's not really reflective of a thorough understanding
of how these binding globulins work, remember, these binding globulins
aren't there to soak up all your testosterone just to make it hard for
you to free up testosterone and you know, make gains in the gym or
whatever it is, or have increases in libido, they're there to actually
transport testosterone to specific tissues, to shuttle them to
specific tissues and to set the rate of bound and unbound testosterone
so that's it's not all unbound at once, and you know, it's always
interesting to look in the literature and see how everyone wants to
free up their testosterone so that it can work, but sex hormone
binding globulin can bind up too much testosterone to the point where
it's having negative effects on libido or on muscle growth and fat
loss and things of that sort, this is true in males and females, or it
can be doing exactly what it's supposed to do, which is shuttling
testosterone to the proper tissues and organs where it has all these
effects, including the brain. So there are supplements, in particular,
tongkat ali, which is, it has this other name, it's something called
tongkat ali, sometimes it's called, and forgive me that it's hard to
pronounce, but Eurycoma longifolia Jack, they always seem to have
these names that kind of allude to androgenic features, like I don't
know why, longifolia Jack, I don't know, I think it's kind of obvious
why that sounds sort of androgenic. This has been shown in several
studies, and you can find these on examine.com, or you can go to
PubMed if you like, I've looked at these, that it does seem to have
some pro-fertility, pro-free testosterone, and subtle aphrodisiac
effects, it does also seem to be a slight anti-estrogen, so the
reports of this are, people take this anywhere from 400 to 800
milligrams a day, again, I'm not suggesting you do that, but that's
kind of what's out there, and there is some decent scientific
literature to support the fact that it liberates some of the bound
testosterone and allows more free testosterone to be available, some
of the reported quote-unquote side effects are things like excessive
alertness and insomnia if it's taken too late in the day and so forth,
but I encourage you to explore that further if that's, if increasing
free testosterone is something that you're interested in doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=6203"&gt;Nettles, Prostate, Boron, &amp;amp; Blood Brain Barrier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine.com includes a lot of other things that can increase
testosterone, one of the things that's been purported to free up
testosterone in the blood are things like nettles, stinging nettles,
although I should point out that the literature points to stinging
nettle also having some fairly potent effects on the prostate and on
the liver, and so it might be a tricky molecule and maybe not an
attractive one for people to take. So we talked about creatine, we
talked about tongkat ali, it's clear that boron, which is really
interesting, believe it or not, I think boron comes from, I think
these were like, meteors that landed on Earth and now they extract
boron, it's one of these crazy stories that, when you look at it, you
go like, "How could that possibly be?" but there's actually, that's
how it works, that boron, there's some scientific support for it
freeing up more testosterone, and again, freeing up testosterone may
be exactly what you want, I just don't think that we should demonize
these carrier proteins like albumin and SHBG, in fact, albumin is very
important for testosterone to be able to make it into the brain to
have some of the pro-androgenic effects on the cognitive effects of
testosterone because in both males and females, testosterone can shift
these behaviors, like mate-seeking, reductions in anxiety, and so
forth, that we talked about before, only by making it into the brain,
and there is this thing called the blood-brain barrier, which is
fascinating and deserving of an entire episode also, and getting
molecules across the blood-brain barrier, even if they're sex steroid
hormones, which are lipophilic and can pass through cell membranes,
requires carriers, and those carriers often are bound to or include
albumin, and so it's not the goal to free up all your testosterone,
but getting free testosterone into a range that works for your
particular goals and needs is an attractive one, and that's why we're
discussing these particular tools. The amounts of boron that people
take, and you can find this, again, on PubMed or Examine, but people
take a couple grams of it a day, I'm not aware of any specific side
effects,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=6327"&gt;Hormone Related Cancers: Sometimes Reducing Estrogen and Testosterone Is Optimal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you always, always, always want to examine for the particular side
effects and people with different backgrounds and conditions, as we
talked about for menopause and estrogen, have to be careful because
when you're starting to modulate hormones, you're starting to modulate
not just the tissues that thrive on binding of those hormones, but
remember, the reason why there's so much breast cancer and there's a
reason why there's so much testicular cancer is that any tissue that
undergoes rapid reproduction of particular cells, so there's a lot of
reproduction of cells in shedding of uterine lining and the
reproduction of cells and eggs in the ovary, and in the testes,
there's the production of Leydig and sertoli cells, and there's this
kind of ongoing production of sperm, that's why those tissues are
particularly vulnerable to the development of cancers, and many of
those cancers are androgen-sensitive, that's why one of the major
treatments for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer is to give anti-
androgenic drugs, okay? It's not just to shut down all things related
to being androgenized, it's really about trying to prevent
testosterone from encouraging growth of tumors, so I want to really
emphasize the caution there because it's easy when thinking about
optimizing estrogen and testosterone to just think, oh, more is
better, more is definitely not better, and it's not just because they
can aromatize or convert into other things, it's because cancers, or
any tissue that has a lot of turnover of cells, is going to thrive on
androgen, anything that promotes growth is going to thrive on
estrogen, remember, brain tissue doesn't turn over that much, there
isn't really much production of new neurons, brain cancers happen but
they're kind of rare, and when they do happen, they tend to be glial
cells, which have a lot of proliferation, glial cells can proliferate,
adult neurons don't create more of themselves, they don't create more
neurons, in general, except in a few places in the brain and body, so
any tissue that recycles itself is prone to cancers, and those tissues
thrive on androgens and estrogens to create more tumor, so you have to
be careful anytime you're modulating hormones, especially androgens
and estrogens, and in my scouring of the literature and looking at
kind of what's out there and what people are talking about, and I also
mean in the scientific literature, one of the things that is new to
me, anyway, probably not new to a lot of the gym rats out there, or
the people that spend a lot of time on YouTube videos talking about
androgens, are these, forgive me for butchering the name again, are
these ecdysteroids, so ecdysteroids are molecules that come from
things like spinach, believe it or not, that have a lot of similarity
to the cholesterol molecule, the one that's being discussed a lot out
there right now is something called turkesterone, I wish I knew why it
was called turkesterone, someone tell me why it's called turkesterone,
does it have anything to do with turkeys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=6463"&gt;Ecdysteroids: Mimic Mammalian Hormones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know why it's called turkesterone, perhaps someone will know.
In any case, these ecdysteroids are similar enough to cholesterol, and
remember, cholesterol is the precursor to testosterone, cortisol, and
estrogen, and it appears that some of these ecdysteroids do have
bioavailability, or their metabolites are bioavailable, and this was
something that, for many years, people talked about whether or not
insect hormones or hormones from other species could actually be used
by humans or whether or not it would have any effect at all, and it's
pretty clear based on a study that I was able to find, there's a paper
that came out in 2019, it's a comparative study in the "Archives of
Toxicology," this is Isenmann et al., I-S-E-N-M-A-N-N et al., that
talks about the ecdysteroids and it was given in conjunction with
strength training or no strength training, this was a 10-week
intervention, and their conclusion is that these ecdysteroids had a
fairly significant, above placebo controls, increases in muscle mass,
strength, hypertrophy effects, all the sorts of things that one would
expect with increases in androgen, their conclusion of this study is
not my conclusion, although I may or may not agree with them, this
isn't about my opinions, it's just, I want to be clear, these are
their words, not mine, but they say that, in their words, quote, "Our
results strongly suggest "the inclusion of ecdysteroid "in the list of
prohibited substances." So they're saying these things are so powerful
that they should be on the list of banned substances, which might be
upsetting to some, or some of you might be thinking, well, who cares?
The whole issue of augmenting hormones in sports is a very interesting
issue, in fact, if you just want a little anecdote about that, I can't
reveal names here, of course, but what I learned recently was very
surprising to me which is that many athletes in pro sports are taking
testosterone, and they are able to do that legally not just because
it's available by prescription, but they are allowed to do that under
the rules of their sport in the fine print that no one, including me,
had ever seen, if they've had an injury, so if athletes are injured,
then it opens up the door for certain forms of testosterone
augmentation and other types of augmentations that are not available
to them if they're not injured, which always makes me wonder now when
I see them getting injured whether or not that's an attempt to get
some of the support because there's absolutely no question that
estrogens and testosterones modulate gene expression, modulate
strength, modulate the way the brain works, modulates our relationship
to effort and anxiety, et cetera, and while we're talking about
supplementation, the effects of supplementation, I would say, in some
individuals can be quite dramatic, but they're always, always, always,
except in extreme cases, going to be far subtler, excuse me, far more
subtle, to use the proper English, far more subtle than would be, for
instance, just in injecting testosterone or injecting estrogen, et
cetera, so I think we should just be honest and upfront about that. So
thus far in terms of talking about optimizing hormones and in the
discussion of supplementation, I haven't really talked about things
that actually affect the brain directly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=6710"&gt;Optimizing Brain Hormones: Chorionic Gonadatropin, Fadogia Agrestis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that increase the pituitary output and things of that sort, we've
mainly been talking about things that free up testosterone or that
increase estrogen at the level of the periphery, but if you remember
way back to the beginning of this episode, hormones are made in
different locations in the body and there are hormones that promote
the release and the production of hormones from other tissues in the
body, and one of the main hormones for that is luteinizing hormone,
luteinizing hormone, again, comes from the pituitary, circulates and
either goes to the ovary to promote various aspects of egg maturation
as well as production of estrogen, and to the testes to promote
testosterone and sperm production, and the prescription version of
increasing luteinizing hormone is something called hCG, or human
chorionic gonadotropin, which has been synthesized and is now
available as a prescription drug, it's taken in various contexts for
increasing fertility both by males and by females, it can increase,
for all the reasons that now make sense, it can increase sperm
production, it can produce ovulation frequency, it can produce the
number of eggs, even, that are deployed in a given ovulation, although
that's not always a good thing, it basically is pro-fertility, pro-
testosterone, pro-estrogen depending on your background, and what's
interesting is hCG was initially synthesized, collected and
synthesized from pregnant women's urine, and believe it or not, before
it was synthetically made and sold as a prescription drug, there was
actually a black market for pregnant women's urine where people would
buy the urine, I don't know, I'm guessing that they probably just
consumed it, which is weird, but in any case, human chorionic
gonadotropin is now available as a prescription drug and it's one of
the things that many people use to increase testosterone or estrogen
for increasing fertility, in some cases I think it's used to increase
sports performance or when people have shut down their gonads for
whatever reason because of excessive hormone therapies or they have
some sort of, sometimes there are actually lesions to the pituitary,
sometimes people have a tumor in the pituitary, it's actually not
common, but among brain tumors and neural tumors, it's one of the more
common ones, and then you get deficiencies in LH and FSH, and so
people will take hCG to stimulate the gonads, so there are a variety
of reasons why these drugs were created, but there are certain
supplements, not many, that apparently can increase luteinizing
hormone and thereby can increase testosterone and estrogen, and one of
the more well-documented one is Fadogia agrestis, that's F-A-D-O-G-
I-A, separate word, A-G-R-E-S-T-I-S, which, at least according to the
literature that I was able to find, can increase levels of luteinizing
hormone and thereby levels of testosterone or levels of estrogen, and
again, if an individual were to take Fadogia agrestis, what they would
probably find is that testosterone and estrogen would increase in
anyone of any chromosomal or gonadal background, but remember, it's
the ratio of both, if someone has low estrogen and high testosterone,
let's say they have testes just by way of example, then both of those
would be expected to increase, and if someone has high estrogen and
low testosterone, and let's just say has ovaries, then both of those
would increase by taking Fadogia agrestis. The side effect profile of
Fadogia agrestis hasn't really been documented, so it's a little
unclear, I just want to emphasize that anytime someone's going to
start taking supplements, or modifying sex steroid hormones, getting
blood work done is extremely important for safety reasons, and also
just to know whether or not things are working, and because all of
these things are subject to negative feedback, talked about this
previously on a previous episode, but if testosterone goes high, or
too high, it can feed back and shut down luteinizing hormone, which
will then shut down further testosterone production, likewise, if
estrogens are going too high or they're going too high at various
phases of the cycle, that can start to throw off various other
hormones, including FSH, progesterone, LH, the menstrual cycle itself
is a just absolutely exquisite balance of feedback of luteinizing
hormone kept low and constant, at least for the first 14 days of the
cycle, then mid cycle, there's a peak, and that's typically when
ovulation occurs, that's why pregnancy is most likely during the
middle of the 28-day cycle, FSH kind of goes up and then down across
the first 14 days, so taking anything or really modifying one's
estrogens or testosterone on that background of the menstrual cycle is
really going to disrupt the way those things interact, and it's just
such an exquisite feedback loop, so I'm not saying don't do that, but
you definitely want to be aware of what you're doing, and blood draws
are one way to do that, monitoring cycles for ovulating females is
another way to do that, and in males, having a good window into what's
going on with testosterone, DHT, aromatase, estradiol, LH, et cetera,
is just vital, and it's really part and parcel with the practice of
thinking about optimizing these incredible things that we call sex
steroid hormones, estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives. The
list of supplements and molecules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=7038"&gt;Additional Compounds, Liver Toxicity, Overall Milieu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that can adjust estrogen and testosterone is vast, and I only touched
on a few of these, I really tried to emphasize the ones for which
there are human studies or that have mostly human studies, or maybe
even just one human study, there are other things out there for which
there are scientific data, things like Bulbine natalensis, which
definitely has support for increasing testosterone but all the studies
were in rats, I think there is some evidence in humans but the
evidence mainly comes in the form of what we call sponsored research,
so companies paying for research, which is different than independent
research by people who are not biased in terms of the outcome, and the
reason I didn't throw out things like Bulbine natalensis is they seem
to have liver toxicity similar to high levels of anabolic exogenous
steroids, there's some problems associated with them that make them,
you know, important to think about if you're curious about this area
and the endocrinology, but also somewhat precarious, and you know,
that's one category, so stuff that doesn't have a lot of evidence in
humans, might actually be dangerous, the other category of things that
has been shown to improve levels of, or increase, I should say, I
don't want to say improve because it's up to you whether or not you
want to increase or decrease estrogen and testosterone, that's highly
individual, how could I know, are the things that are kind of
housekeeping for production of estrogen and testosterone, things like
magnesium, things like D3, things like zinc, you know, those are the
things that are going to create an overall milieu of opportunity to
produce normal endogenous levels rather than increasing endogenous
levels further, and so I really want to highlight that there's a
difference between taking something to create a kind of backdrop of
general support and taking something that's going to create a big
inflection in the levels of a given hormone. So once again, we covered
a tremendous amount of information,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&amp;amp;t=7157"&gt;Summary: And Note About Additional Related Topic Coverage Coming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we covered some basic science of hormones and pheromones, estrogen and
testosterone and their derivatives, we talked about supplementation
and behaviors, competition and parenting, and how all these things
interact, and I hope that you'll come away from this with a deeper
mechanistic understanding of how the brain and body are interacting to
control the output and the ways in which these incredible things that
we call sex steroid hormones work and influence us, I hope you'll also
come away with some ideas of things that you can do, in particular,
behavioral practices that can improve sleep and your relationship to
light, et cetera, because those things really set the foundation not
just for healthy steroid hormone output, but for all sorts of health
effects and for both the psychology and the biology of your nervous
system, so I'm sure there'll be many questions, there are many things
that I couldn't get to today, I do try and limit these episodes to
about 90 minutes, which is the optimal ultradian cycle for learning,
it's a lot of information, but we've timestamped everything for you,
so feel free to look over it in parts or circle back where you might
want deeper understanding, and please put your questions in the
comments section below, please put suggestions for future episodes and
things that relate to hormones in the comments section below, we do
look at those and we do use them to inform the content for subsequent
episodes. If you're enjoying and learning from this podcast, please

podcast at any level that you like. As well, we've partnered with
Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, which is a supplement company, the reason we
partner with Thorne is that they have the highest levels of stringency
in terms of the quality of the supplements that they make and the
quantity of the individual ingredients, something that's not always
the case with various supplement companies, but Thorne is exquisitely
good about the stringency of their products, they partner with the
Mayo Clinic and all the major sports teams. If you want to check out
Thorne and see the supplements that I take, you can go to
thorne.com/u/huberman, and if you do that, you can see the supplements
I take, but as well, it will allow you to get 20% off any of those
supplements or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes, that's

supplements. In closing, I hope you'll leave today's episode with a
much richer understanding of the mechanisms that control the endocrine
and nervous system in the context of estrogen and testosterone, as
well as take away various tools that you might choose to apply, and
next week, we'll be back with another episode about the role of
hormones and its important interactions with the nervous system, and
that will, of course, include both mechanisms and tools as well, and
as always, thank you for your interest in science. [upbeat music]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Note: Future episodes will focus on the science of prescription
hormone replacement therapies, the science of hormone-based birth
control and the role of testosterone, estrogen and other compounds in
fertility, athletic performance and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[upbeat music] - [Andrew Huberman] Welcome to The Huberman Lab
Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday
life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of Neurobiology and
Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of
my desire and effort, to bring zero cost to consumer information about
science and science related tools. In keeping with that theme, I'd
like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is
Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better
understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I'm a big
believer in blood tests and DNA tests for the simple reason that many
of the factors that are important for your short-term and long-term
health and overall wellbeing can only be analyzed from blood and DNA
tests. Things like metabolic factors and hormone levels, really can
only be assessed accurately from blood and DNA. The thing I like about
Inside Tracker is you don't just get back levels of different hormones
and metabolic factors and so forth, you also get directives. It has a
dashboard that's very easy to use that tells you based on your data,
what sorts of foods you might want to eat more of or less of. What
forms of exercise you might want to do more of or less of. It's really
a wonderful way to assess how your behaviors and lifestyle choices are
interacting with what's going on deep within your biology. Inside
Tracker makes all of that super easy to understand. It's also really
easy to get the blood tests and DNA tests taken. You can go to a local
location or they can send somebody to your home if you prefer that. If
you'd like to try Inside Tracker you can visit

Tracker's plans and use the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode
is also brought to you by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses
and pillows that are designed to meet your sleep needs, in order to
optimize your sleep. I've done several episodes of this podcast and
there's a ton of information out there pointing to the fact that
getting really deep restful sleep each night is vital for mental and
physical health. And the mattress that you sleep on and the pillow
that you use is very important for getting optimal sleep. Helix Sleep
has a brief two minute quiz that you can take. It asks you questions
like, "Do you sleep on your side, or your back or your stomach or
maybe you don't know? Do you tend to run hot or cold as you sleep or
maybe you don't know?" That two minute quiz matches you to a mattress
and pillow that's ideal for your sleep needs. I took this quiz, I
matched to the mattress they call "The Dusk," D-U-S-K. And I've been
sleeping on "The Dusk" mattress for many months now and I've been
sleeping better than I ever have before. It's really wonderful to have
a really good night's sleep on a consistent basis. It's a total game
changer. So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, you can
go to helixsleep.com/huberman. Take their two minutes sleep quiz and
they'll match you to a customized mattress. And you'll get up to $200
off any of their mattress orders and two free pillows. So that's
helixsleep.com/huberman. Take the two minutes sleep quiz they'll match
you to a mattress. And if you order one of their mattresses, you'll
get up to $200 off any of their mattresses and two free pillows. They
have a 10 year warranty and you get to try out the mattress for 100
nights risk-free and if you don't like it they'll pick it up and take
it away. If you love it, then you keep it. And I think there's a very
good chance that you're going to love it, I certainly loved mine. And
today's episode is also brought to you by Athletic Greens. Athletic
Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started
using Athletic Greens way back in 2012. And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast. I started using Athletic Greens
because I found it rather confusing to figure out what vitamins and
minerals to take. And in Athletic Greens, I get all the vitamins and
minerals I need to cover my bases. As well probiotics are really
important. Probiotics have been shown now in numerous studies to be
important for the gut microbiome, which impacts the gut brain axis, as
well as various aspects of bodily health. So in Athletic Greens I get
vitamins, minerals and probiotics. I also really like the way it
tastes. It's a greens drink, so you mix it with some water. You could
mix it with something else like juice if you like. I mix mine with
water and lemon juice and I drink it once or twice a day. If you want
to try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman. And
if you do that, you'll claim their special offer, which is to get a
years supply of vitamin D3 K2. There's now also a wealth of data
showing that Vitamin D3 is important for various aspects of brain and
body health. So that's athleticgreens.com/huberman for Athletic Greens
and a years supply of Vitamin D3 K2. You'll also get five free travel
packets. The travel packets are just a really convenient way to take
Athletic Greens when you're on the road, in the car or on a plane or
just moving around. You just empty one of the packets into a water
bottle or a glass and mix it up really quickly. It saves any kind of
mess or anything of that sort. So once again
athleticgreens.com/huberman to get Vitamin D3 K2. That's a year supply
and the five free travel packs. It's a new month, which means it's a
new topic here at the Huberman Lab Podcast. For the next four or so
episodes, we're going to be talking all about hormone affects on the
brain and body. So that's a huge number of different topics. We're
going to talk about sex. We're going to talk about reproduction. We're
going to talk about puberty a little bit more. We talked about that in
a previous episode. We're going to talk about menopause. We're going
to talk about birth control. We are going to talk about aggression,
competition, winning, losing. Basically, we're going to cover as much
about hormones as we possibly can in this month and in doing so we are
going to go deep into tools and protocols. We are also going to talk
about a lot of tools that relate to things that you might not want to
do in order to optimize hormone health, regardless of stage of life or
your goals et cetera. So it's sure to be a month rich with discussion,
rich with tools and you're going to learn a lot of neuroscience and
endocrinology. There's actually a field of neuro-endocrinology. It's
actually where I started my graduate work. I did a masters in it.
Which has only to say that I love the topic. I have a lot of friends
that work on this topic, many of whom I've consulted for these
episodes. And I'm really excited to share the information with you.
Before we dive into today's episode, "All About Emotions and Sex." I
want to just to have a few announcements that are designed to point
you to some useful resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=407"&gt;Announcement: Mood Meter App Works Again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last episode, "Talking About The Science of Emotions and
Relationships." I mentioned the Mood Meter app. The Mood Meter App was
developed by people out at Yale University who study the biology and
psychology of emotions. It's a really wonderful app. However, many of
you quickly told me that the Mood Meter App isn't available in your
area. You went to the link we posted and it just was saying not
available in your area. The situation was actually a lot worse than
that. The situation was that, when we recorded the episode the Mood
Meter App was working. I know 'cause I downloaded a fresh copy of it
to my phone. And then in the ensuing weekend, they took the Mood Meter
App down for some repairs. The Mood Meter app is now up. It is
available. I want to be really clear. It's not an app I'm affiliated
with. I'm just mentioning it to you. They don't know me. I know them,
but they don't know me. So we don't have any kind of business
relationship. They do charge 99 cents for the app. I think the free
version has disappeared in the last year or so. So that's Mood Meter
app. We'll provide the link again and the link should be working.
Hopefully they won't take it down again, in between this announcement
and the release of this episode. Also just want to take a step back
for a moment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=480"&gt;Maximizing Learning from the Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and talk a little bit about the logic of how to make the most of the
information on the Huberman Lab Podcast. I tend to throw out a lot of
information about a given topic. Many of you have pointed out however,
that I don't cover certain things. And once again I'll just say the
goal is always to be accurate, but there's no way I can be exhaustive.
There's no way I can cover everything for a particular topic. The good
news is we have time. My goal, at least in the first year of the
Huberman Lab Podcast, is to give you a basis, a foundation in these
different topics of neuro-plasticity, focus, sleep, hormones et
cetera. And of course, to provide tools along the way. We are going to
host guests, I've actually started recording with some of these guests
already. And even those episodes will include a little what we call
primer. A little description of the basics of a given topic so that
you can get more information from those topics. My goal really is to
educate you in these topics, give you a foundation in these topics and
allow you to start exploring them here in the episodes with our future
guests, but also in other podcasts and books and other sources of
information. So for those of you that are saying, "It's too much
information." I just encourage you to remind yourself that you have a
pause button you can return to it. Everything's timestamped. For those
of you that feel, it's not enough information I'm not covering enough.
Just know that this is just the beginning. We didn't intend to do this
for a very long time and we will be thorough over time. So thanks for
your patience and please be patient with yourselves. There's no reason
why you have to digest all the information in one swoop. The other
thing is that I've been told both that I speak too fast and speak too
slow. So there's a wonderful solution to this. If I speak too fast or
too slow you can adjust the speed in YouTube. If you're listening in a
different format, I think you also can adjust the speed of playback.
So that's something that wouldn't be possible in the classroom, but
you may find useful. And then last but not least,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=600"&gt;New Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol, Spanish Subtitles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to point people again to this NSDR, non-sleep deep rest
protocol, that the folks over at Madefor have put out as a free
resource. It does, as many of you pointed out, bear resemblance to
things like yoga nidra and other forms of meditation. But what we've
done is we've stripped out intentions or any kind of the verbiage
related to what some people might perceive as kind of related to the
yoga community or specific to kind of new age-y type techniques. Not
because we don't like yoga nidra. In fact, I've done yoga nidra daily
for almost the last goodness, eight years of my life. I love yoga
nidra, but sometimes the complicated language can be a separator and
can discourage people from taking on these protocols that are
extremely useful. So NSDR is intentionally generic. It's designed to
bring you into a state of deep relaxation through a combination of
breathing and body scan. There's the you too script over at Madefor
which is linked in the caption. And many people find that they prefer
that to scripts like yoga nidra. Scripts where they're doing
intentions and they're hearing a lot of kind of unusual language
around the process. This is just very basic and I hope you'll enjoy
it. And if you prefer the more typical yoga nidra scripts then go with
those. There are many of them available on the internet and elsewhere.
And last but not least I want to point out that, all our episodes now
are subtitled both in English and in Spanish. So for those of you that
prefer to digest this information in Spanish, that's now available to
you in the subtitles. Today we're going to talk about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=695"&gt;Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons &amp;amp; Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Science of Sex. In particular, sexual differentiation. Now that's
a complicated topic because sex is both a adjective, a noun and a
verb, depending on the context. Today we're going to talk about the
hormonal effects and the neural effects of particular events that
happen during development and how those guide adolescent and adult
behavior, including sexual preference. It's an area that's fascinating
and for which, there are actually very solid textbook findings. So
textbook findings means, that there are many studies that have been
aggregated over decades. That point to what we now know to be absolute
truths in terms of how hormones affect brain development, how the
brain impacts hormonal development and how those interact to control
behavior for instance. We are also going to talk about reproduction,
the verb sex. And of course, sex the verb, can also be carried out
independent of reproduction. It's not always, in particular in humans,
just to produce offspring. So that's going to be covered in the next
episode, but you absolutely need to understand the information in this
episode, in order to make sense of the information in the next
episode. So, today we're going to explore hormones. What they are, how
they work, what leads to masculinization or feminization of the brain
and body? I'll just throw out one really interesting fact that perhaps
most of you didn't realize that hormones have direct effects on the
body. Most people know that because there are hormone differences and
sex differences in bodies in terms of genitalia and body hair,
distribution of body hair et cetera. But there are also effects of
hormones on the brain directly and believe it or not there're also
effects on the spinal cord. On the neurons and structures within the
spinal cord that impact in a very direct way, what sorts of behaviors
are possible. So it's a fascinating area, you might notice I'm going
to go a little bit more slowly through this topic than I normally do.
I want to be extremely careful with my language. Some of these topics,
some of you may be thinking are extremely sensitive, right? And of
course, any discussion about sex and reproduction is a sensitive one.
But today we're just talking about the biology. We're not getting into
the cultural constraints or the cultural dialogue. What we're trying
to do today is really get to the biology, the physiology, the
endocrinology and the behavior. So let's start by talking about what
hormones are just to remind you and what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=855"&gt;Hormones Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormones by definition, are a substance, a chemical that's released in
one area of the body. Typically from something we call a gland,
although they can also be released from neurons. But they're released
often from glands, that travel and have effects both on that gland but
also on other organs and tissues in the body. And that differentiates
hormones from things like neurotransmitters, which tend to act more
locally. So that's important. A hormone is a substance secreted at one
location in the body, travels, and has impact on things elsewhere in
the body. Examples of tissues that produce hormones would be the
thyroid, the testes, the ovaries et cetera. And then of course there
are areas of the brain like the hypothalamus and the pituitary, which
are closely related to one another and release hormones that cause the
release of yet other hormones out in the body. So we're going to cover
all this. If you don't know anything about endocrinology, you're still
going to be able to understand today's discussion. And we're going to
start with a discussion about, what hormones actually do, to create
this thing that we call masculinization or feminization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=926"&gt;Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's start with development. Sperm meets egg. Everything that
happens before that is a topic of the next episode. But, sperm meets
egg. This is mammalian reproduction. And that egg starts to duplicate,
it starts to make more of itself. It makes more cells. And eventually
some of those cells become skin. Some of those cells become brain.
Some of those cells become muscle. Some of those cells become fingers.
All the stuff that makes up the brain and body plan. In addition,
there are hormones that come both from the mother and from the
developing baby, the developing fetus. That impact. whether or not the
brain will be what they call organized masculine or organized
feminine. And as I say this, I want you to try and discard with the
cultural connotations or your psychological connotations, of what
masculinization and feminization are. Because we're only centering on
the biology. So typically, people have either two X chromosomes, and
the traditional language around that is that person is female, right?
Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome and that person will become
male. Now it's not always the case. There are cases where it's XXY,
where there two X chromosomes plus a Y chromosome. There are also
cases where it's XYY. Where they're two Y chromosomes. and these have
important biological and psychological impacts. So the first thing we
need to establish is that there is something called chromosomal sex.
Whether or not they're two X chromosomes, or an X and Y chromosome, is
what we call chromosomal sex. But the next stage of separating out the
sexes, is what we call gonadal sex. Typically not always, but
typically if somebody has testes for their gonads, we think of them as
male. And if somebody has ovaries, we think of them as female.
Although that's not always the case either. But let's just explore the
transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex, because it's a
fascinating one that we all went through in some form or another. So
this XY that we typically think of as promoting masculinization of the
fetus. We say that because on the Y chromosome there are genes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1070"&gt;Y Chromosome Inhibition of Feminization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and those genes have particular functions that suppress female
reproductive organs. So on the Y chromosome there's a gene, which
encodes for something called Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone. So there's
actually a hormone that's programmed by the Y chromosome that inhibits
the formation of Mullerian Ducts, which are an important part of the
female reproductive apparatus. That's critical because, already we're
seeing the transition between chromosome Y chromosome and gonad. And
other genes on the Y chromosome promote the formation of testes. So
there are genes like the SRY gene and other genes that promote the
formation of testes, while they also inhibit the formation of the
Mullerian Ducts. So the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex
is a very important distinction. It's kind of a fork in the road that
happens very early in development while fetuses are still in the
embryo. Now what's interesting as well, is that just because there's a
Y chromosome that can suppress Mullerian Duct formation and there are
other genes on the Y chromosome that promote testes development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1140"&gt;Placenta Is An Endocrine (Hormone-Producing) Organ, Adrenal Testosterone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The placenta itself is an endocrine organ. I think most people don't
know this but the placenta is an endocrine organ as well. The mother,
which of course is carrying the fetus has an adrenal gland which can
produce testosterone. There are instances for example, where a mother
has either a tumor or for some other reason is secreting large levels
of testosterone while carrying a fetus that is XX. And that leads to
what we would call masculinization of certain aspects of the fetus.
Typically, that will be enlarged clitoris. There also some examples of
other phenotypes on the body that are created even though it's a
purely XX chromosomal baby. So we have to distinguish between
chromosomal sex, gonadal sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1185"&gt;Hormonal Sex, Morphological Sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there's what we call hormonal sex. Which is the effects of
the steroid hormones, estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives,
on what we call morphological sex or the shape of the baby and the
human and the genitalia and the jaw and all these other things. And so
it actually is quite complicated. So you know, it's a long distance
from chromosomes to gender identity and gender identity has a lot of
social influences and roles. This is an area that right now is very
dynamic and in the discussion out there as you know. But just getting
from chromosomal sex to what we would call gonadal sex and hormonal
sex and morphological sex, involves a number of steps. So today we're
going to talk about those steps. And there's some fascinating things
that do indeed relate to tools. Do indeed relate to some important
behavioral choices. Important choices about things to avoid while
pregnant. And for those of you that are not pregnant, things to avoid
if you're thinking about eventually having children. And that is not
to drive development in one direction or another, but there are
examples where there are some deleterious things in our environment
that can actually negatively impact what we call sexual development
overall, regardless of chromosomal background. So let's get started
with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1264"&gt;Hormones Fast &amp;amp; Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn On Genes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk a little bit more about what hormones do. Hormones
generally have two categories of effects. They can either be very fast
or they can be very slow. There are hormones like cortisol and
adrenaline, which act very fast. Adrenaline can increase your heart
rate very fast when secreted into the body. Cortisol can be a little
bit slower, but it also can have some very fast effects. And then
there are hormones like. Like testosterone and estrogen, which we
refer to as the sex steroid hormones. The sex steroid hormones can
have quick effects through signaling. Meaning they can attach to cells
and make those cells do different things. They can have a actually
quite quick effects on the brain. A lot of people don't know this, but
there are some very fast effects of estrogen and testosterone as well
as long-term effects. These molecules, for those of you that are
interested, are what it called lipophilic. Which just means that they
like fatty stuff, they can actually pass through fatty membranes. And
because the outside of cells, as well as the what's called the nuclear
envelope. Where all the DNA contents and stuff are stuffed inside, are
made of lipid, of fat. These steroid hormones can actually travel into
cells and then get into the DNA. Basically interact with the DNA of
cells in order to control gene expression. So they can change the
sorts of things that cells will become and they can change the way
that cells function in a long-term way. And that's actually how the
presence of these genes like SRY and Mullerian inhibiting hormone,
lead to reductions or elimination I should say, of things like the
Mullerian Ducts and promote instead what's called in males the
Wolffian Ducts. Or promote the development of testes rather than
ovaries. So all you need to know is that hormones have short-term and
long-term effects. And the long-term effects are actually related to
their effects on genes and how those genes are expressed or repressed,
in order to prevent them from having particular proteins made. So
these hormones, these steroid hormones are exceedingly powerful. And
if we're going to have a discussion about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1386"&gt;Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;masculinization or feminization et cetera, you also need to think
about the counterpart. It's not just about masculinizing the body or
feminizing the body and brain, it's also about demasculinize the brain
in many cases, as a normal biological function of typically of XX
females. And de feminization, the suppression of certain pathways that
are related to feminization of the body and brain. But there are some
really fascinating twists in this story. So I've just thrown a lot of
biology at you, but this is where it all starts to get incredibly
surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1422"&gt;Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that it's straightforward, right? You have a Y
chromosome you suppress the female reproductive pathway like the
Mullerian Ducts. You promote the development of testes and then testes
make testosterone. And then it organizes the brain male and it wants
to do male like things. And then in females you get estrogen and it
wants to do female like things. And air quotes here for all of this.
It turns out that isn't how it works at all. Here's where it's
interesting. We have to understand that there are effects of these
hormones, testosterone and estrogen. on what are called primary sexual
characteristics. Which are the ones that you're born with. Secondary
sexual characteristics, which are the ones that show up in puberty.
And these are happening in the brain and body and spinal cord. And so
I'm going to disentangle all this for you by giving you some examples.
First, let's talk about the development of primary sexual
characteristics. The ones that show up at birth. And one of the more
dramatic examples of this comes from the role of testosterone in
creating the external genitalia. Now you might think it's just
straight forward. If there's a testes, 'cause there's a Y chromosome.
You know, you've got a gene that codes for the development of testes,
you get testosterone and the penis grows and the baby is born with a
penis. You know, one of the first things that happens when the baby
comes out is they look at the genitalia, and they try and make an
assessment on whether or not it's a quote boy or it's a quote girl,
right? That's been done for a very very long time throughout human
history. It turns out that it's not testosterone that's responsible
for the development of the penis in a baby that has an X chromosome
and a Y chromosome. It's a different androgen. Androgen is just a
category of hormones that includes testosterone, but testosterone is
converted in the fetus to something called dihydrotestosterone. And
that's accomplished through an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. Now
dihydrotestosterone has important effects later in life too. We will
talk about those. In fact, if you just want to know,
dihydrotestosterone is what we would call the dominant androgen in
males. It's responsible for aggression. It's responsible for a lot of
muscular strength. It's involved in beard growth and male pattern
baldness. We're going to talk about all of that. But
dihydrotestosterone has powerful effects in determining the genitalia,
while the baby is still in the embryo. So this ends. There's
testosterone that's made. And that testosterone gets converted by this
enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in a little structure called the tubercle.
That tubercle will eventually become the penis. So you say, "Okay,
straight forward." This testosterone is converted to
dihydrotestosterone. And then if there's dihydrotestosterone it
controls penis growth. And indeed that's the case. So that's a primary
sexual characteristic. That baby will then grow up and later during
puberty there will be the release of a molecule. I talked about this
last episode called Kisspeptin. K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N kisspeptin,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1623"&gt;Secondary Sexual Characteristics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which will cause the release of some other hormones Connatural
releasing hormone, Luteinizing hormone will stimulate the testes to
make testosterone. So in puberty, testosterone leads to further growth
and development of the penis, as well as the accumulation of or growth
of pubic hair, a deepening of the voice, all the secondary sexual
characteristics, okay? So dihydrotestosterone creates what we would
call the typical masculine phenotype for primary sexual
characteristics and produces. Testosterone excuse me, produces
secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. There's a very
interesting phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1663"&gt;Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that was published in The Journal of Science in the 1970s, for which
now there's a wealth of scientific data. And this relates to a genetic
mutation, where 5-alpha-reductase the enzyme that converts
testosterone to dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist. It's mutated in a
way into a genome that it doesn't exist. And this actually was first
identified in the Dominican Republic. It has shown up elsewhere. It's
quite rare, but where it shows up it's robust. What happens is baby is
born. Typically when a baby is born they don't measure chromosomes.
They don't look at chromosomal sex XX or XY. That's not typically done
nowadays. Baby is born. If you were to look at that baby, it would
look female. There would be very little or no external penis. And so
people would say, "It's a girl." And they might, you know, have the
celebration it's a girl. And I guess now they call them "Gender Reveal
Parties" or something like that. I don't know about this, but anyway.
They would reveal. The baby would reveal its external genitalia simply
by being there and being naked when it's born. It has nothing to do
with gender, it has to do with genitalia and sex. That baby would be
born. And what was observed is that, from time to time, that baby
after being raised as a girl, perfectly happy as a girl would around
the age of 11 or 12 or 13, would suddenly start to sprout a penis.
There's actually a name for this, it's called Guevedoces. Which the
translation is more or less, penis at 12. And as strange as this might
sound, it makes sense if you understand the underlying mutation. What
happens in these children, these Guevedoces, is that the child is
born. It has testes which are not descended, so up in the body.
They're not making a lot of testosterone early on. They weren't able
to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone because they lack this
enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. As a consequence, the primary sexual
characteristic of external male genitalia, penis, doesn't develop. And
then what happens is the baby grows up as a young child essentially is
treated as a girl. Generally they report being pretty comfortable as
girls, although not always. And then testosterone starts getting
secreted from the testes 'cause kisspeptin in the brain signals
through gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone and travels down to the
testes, the testes start churning out testosterone and there's a
secondary growth of the penis. And all of a sudden there's a penis.
And this leads to some very complicated situations in families and
culturally. And actually the outcomes in terms of whether or not these
children decide to self identify as males or females and how people
treat them actually varies quite a lot. There's actually been kind of
an adopting of a third category of sex and gender in these Guevedoces
for in order to just offer them the opportunity to explore not just
what would be a typical kind of girl or woman or boy or man phenotype,
but something in between. Something that some people call intersex
although intersex and pseudo hermaphroditism is actually a separate
thing altogether. So it's fascinating and the point here is that
dihydrotestosterone not testosterone is responsible for this primary
growth of the penis. And that testosterone later is involved in the
secondary sexual characteristics deepening in the voice, et cetera.
Now this is where the information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1885"&gt;Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes The Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gets even more interesting and applies to essentially everybody. You
might think that testosterone because it masculinizes the body in the
secondary sexual characteristic way. And because dihydrotestosterone
another androgen, masculinizes the primary sexual characteristics. The
growth of the penis early on, that testosterone must masculinize the
brain. And there are in fact aspects of masculinization of the brain
and body, that are independent of genitalia. Now it might be obvious
to some of you, but some people probably don't realize that. Yes
indeed the brain has receptors for testosterone. It also has receptors
for estrogen. But the fascinating thing is that if you look at the
brains of people that have Y chromosomes and that have testes and that
make testosterone, and you look at the brains of people that don't
have Y chromosomes or testes and therefore make far less testosterone
in general, what you realize is that the cells in the brain that
differ between what I'll call males and females, but between XY, and
XX have receptors for testosterone, but the masculinization of the
brain is not accomplished by testosterone. I want to repeat this. The
masculinization of the brain is not accomplished by testosterone. It
is accomplished by estrogen. Testosterone can be converted into
estrogen by an enzyme called aromatase. This is vitally important to
understand. Testosterone can be converted into estrogen by something
called aromatase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=1995"&gt;Breast Development In Males: Aromatase; Puberty, &amp;amp; Steroids in Athletes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give an example of where this happens later in life, to just
illustrate the principle and really embed it in your mind. During
puberty in boys, XY chromosome individuals. It's not uncommon for
there to be transient or sometimes long lasting breast bud
development. Testosterone goes up during puberty, for the reasons we
talked about before. And some of that testosterone gets converted into
estrogen by an enzyme called aromatase. Aromatase is made by several
sources in the body. One of the main sources is body fat. So it can
make a lot of aromatase. Sometimes you'll even see fairly dramatic
breast development in males during puberty. Sometimes it's transient,
sometimes it's not. The other place where you see this is in athletes
and bodybuilders that take a lot of anabolic steroids. That take high
levels of androgens. So they'll be taking testosterone at super
physiological doses. Sometimes not always. They will convert some of
that testosterone into estrogen and they'll get what's called
gynecomastia. Which is the development of male breast tissue.
Sometimes they'll get it cut out surgically. Other times they'll start
trying to take estrogen blockers in order to try and suppress it or
they'll try and block prolactin. It's a topic that we're going to get
into in more detail. But what's important here is to understand that
testosterone can be converted to estrogen by aromatase. Aromatase is
not just made in body fat. There are neurons in the brain that make
aromatase and convert testosterone into estrogen. And it is
testosterone converted into estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=2090"&gt;Estrogen Powerfully Controls Brain Development In All Individuals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it's estrogen that masculinizes XY individual. That
masculinizes the brain. And this has profound effects on all sorts of
things. On behavior, on outlook in the world et cetera. But I think
most people don't realize that it's estrogen that comes from
testosterone that masculinizes the male brain, the XY brain. Not
testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=2119"&gt;Avoiding Hormonal Disruption In Children &amp;amp; Adults: Specific Oils, Creams, Etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I just want to mention some tools. You might be asking yourself,
"How could tools possibly come up at this stage of the conversation
where we're talking about sexual development and we're talking about
the differentiation of tissues in the body." Well, this is true both
for children and parents and adults. I want to emphasize that there
are things that are environmental and there are things that people use
in their homes sometimes that actually can impact hormone levels and
can impact sexual development in fairly profound ways. And I want to
be very clear, this is not me pulling from some rare journal have
never heard of it. This is pulling from textbooks. In particular,
today I'm guiding a lot of the conversation on work that on
"Behavioral Endocrinology," is a book by Randy Nelson and Lance
Kriegsfeld. True experts in the field. I'm going to talk about some of
the work from Tyrone Hayes from UC Berkeley about environmental toxins
and their impacts on some of these things like testosterone and
estrogen. I'm going to touch into them. I'm going to give some
anecdotal evidence that's grounded in studies, which we will provide
in the caption or that I'll reference here. One of those that's
actually really interesting but helps illustrate the principle that
we've been talking about is. A few years ago, there was a lot of
excitement about Evening Primrose Oil. Evening Primrose Oil is in a
lot of products that typically are associated with skin beauty and
skin health. And so I'm generalizing here. But typically it was
mothers or sisters that were using it. And there were actually
examples starting to crop up of young boys getting accelerated breast
bud development from skin contact with women were using Evening
Primrose Oil. So Evening Primrose Oil is chemically a lot like
estrogen and it has a lot of estrogenic compounds. There are a number
of things out there like this. So believe it or not things like pine
pollen look very much like testosterone structurally. They are more or
less are testosterone. Their bioavailability in humans isn't as clear.
Evening Primrose Oil has a lot of estrogenic elements to it. Just
structurally how it's built. And so there were cases where boys were
understandably you know, being hugged by their mom or maybe even like
showering and taking. you know using the Evening Primrose Oil
solution. Those things will actually change levels of estrogens in
boys and girls. And so this wasn't just an issue for young boys. This
is also an issue for young girls. So it's not that Evening Primrose
Oil is bad, it's just that many of you have probably heard about the
dangers of Soy Isoflavones and things like that. The impact of soy on
estrogen levels is, there are some decent evidence to support that.
However, there's a lot of other factors that are more severe. And one
of those is this Evening Primrose Oil. So regardless of age, let's
just put it this way because people might be wanting to drive their
hormones more estrogenic or more androgenic. How could I know which
what your preference is? I don't know. But in any case, things like
pre Evening Primrose Oil can actually promote estrogenic pathways in
the body and some of it can go transdermal. Likewise, because
testosterone replacement therapy is fairly widespread nowadays. And
some people accomplish that through cream. It's pretty well understood
that, if someone's taking that they want to avoid contact with anyone.
Skin contact with anyone that is trying to promote more estrogenic
activity in their body. And especially in children. So that's one. The
other is this issue of environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=2340"&gt;Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this, you know, again I'm just going to highlight, when one starts
talking about environmental factors and how they're poisoning us or
disrupting growth or fertility rates it can start to sound a little
bit crazy. Except when you start to actually look at some of the real
data, Data from quality research labs funded by Federal government
funded, not from companies or other sources, that are really aimed at
understanding what the underlying biology is. And for that I really,
we should all be grateful to Tyrone Hayes at UC Berkeley. I remember
way back when I was a graduate student in the late nineties, goodness.
at UC Berkeley. And I remember him, he was studying frogs. He was
talking about developmental defects in these frogs that live in
different waters around it was California, but also elsewhere. And he
identified a substance, which is present in a lot of waterways
throughout this country and other countries. So US and beyond.
Certainly not just restricted to California, which is atrazine. This
is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E. Again, this is the stuff of textbooks. And it
causes severe testicular malformations. So again, atrazine exposure is
serious. And what's interesting is if you look at the data, what you
find is that at sites in Western and Midwestern sections of the United
States 10 to 92% of male frogs. These were frogs mind you, had
testicular abnormalities. And the most severe testicular malformations
were in the testes rather than in the sperm. So it's actually the
organ itself, the gonad itself. Now it's very well known now that
atrazine is in many herbicides. And so you know, whereas I would say
in the 80's and 90's the discussion around herbicides and their
negative effects was considered kind of like hippy-dippy stuff or the
stuff you hear about at you know, your local community markets and
these kind of new age communities. Now there's very solid data, from
Federally funded labs at major universities that have been peer
reviewed and published in excellent journals, showing that indeed many
of these herbicides can have negative effects, primarily by impacting
the ratios of these hormones in either the mothers or in the testes,
altering the testes of the fathers or direct effects on developing
young animals and potentially humans. And so you ask, "Well, what
about humans? Frogs are wonderful, but what about humans?" So here are
the data on what's happening and this isn't all going to be scary
stuff. We're also going to talk about tools to ameliorate and offset
some of these effects. One would be, be cautious with Evening Primrose
as well as testosterone creams, depending on whether or not you want
to be more androgenic or estrogenic depending on your needs. But
across human populations, sperm counts are indeed declining, okay? So
in 1940, the average, the average density of human sperm was 113
million per milliliter of semen. That's how it's measured. How many
sperm per milliliter of semen. In 1990 this figure has dropped to 66.
So it went from 113 million per milliliter to 66 million per
milliliter in the United States and Western Europe. So this is not
just a US thing. Researchers also estimated that the volume of semen
produced by men has dropped 20% in that time, reduced sperm count per
generation even further. So between 1981 and 1991, the ratio of normal
spermatogenesis has decreased from 56.4% to 26.9%. So there's a lot
that's happening primarily because of these herbicides that are in
widespread use to reduce sperm counts. And these are going to have
profound effects not just on sperm counts, but on development, sexual
development at the level of the gonads and the brain. Because you need
testosterone to get dihydrotestosterone for primary sexual
characteristics. You need estrogen that's come from testosterone to
masculinize the brain. And of course, we're not just focusing on sperm
and testosterone. You of course also know that many of these
herbicides are disrupting estrogens in a similar way. Or are leading
to hyper estrogenic, excuse me, states which might explain why puberty
is happening so much earlier in young girls these days. So there are a
lot of things that are happening. Now does this mean that you have to
run around and neurotically avoid anything that includes things like
atrazine and should you be avoiding all kinds of herbicides? I don't
know that's up to you. But it does seem that these have pretty marked
effects, in both the animal studies and in the human studies. You
know, you can open up a textbook like the endocrinology textbook and
find things like Vinclozolin. V-I-N-C-L-O-Z-O-L-I-N, which is a
fungicide and it's an anti-androgen. You give it to animals, to rats.
And instead of forming a penis, they don't form a penis. They
basically, it's not that they form a clitoris, they just don't form a
penis. So let's talk about female sexual development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=2660"&gt;Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Hormones Need Receptors, SARMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as always what we'll do is, we'll talk about the normal biology.
Then we'll talk a little bit about a kind of extraordinary or unusual
set of cases, but we'll talk about them because they illustrate an
important principle about how things work under typical circumstances.
So there is a mutation called androgen insensitivity syndrome. And
understanding how androgen insensitivity syndrome works can help you
really understand how hormones impact sexual development. So here's
how it works. There are individuals who are XY, so they have a Y
chromosome, that are born that make testosterone. They have testes and
they don't have Mullerian Ducts because on the Y chromosome is this
Mullerian inhibiting hormone. However, these individuals look
completely female. And in general, they report feeling like girls when
they're young, women when they're older. But there's something unusual
that's happening in these individuals because they have an XY
chromosomal type and not XX. So what's happening? Well what's
happening is the testes are making testosterone, but the receptor for
testosterone is mutated. And therefore the testes never descend. They
don't have ovaries, they have testes but the testes are internal. And
so typically these individuals find out that they are actually XY
chromosomes. so that you know, their chromosomal sex is male. If you
will. And their gonadal sex is male, but the gonads, the testes are
inside the body. They don't actually develop a scrotum. They don't
make ovaries. And when they don't menstruate around the time of
puberty that's a sign that something is different. And so they never
menstruate around puberty. And if they look into this deeply enough,
what you find is that they are actually XY. They make testosterone but
their body can't make use of the testosterone because they don't have
the receptors. And the receptors are vitally important for some, for
most all of the secondary sexual characteristics that we talked about.
Body hair, penis growth during puberty et cetera. They live fairly
happy lives as females. Although of course they can't conceive, right?
They don't have a uterus, they don't have ovaries. They also in
general, don't produce sperm in quantities enough that they could
actually reproduce with somebody else, although sometimes they can.
And believe it or not, and I'm not going to name names but there are
actually reports of several people, fairly prominent people throughout
history who have had this androgen insensitivity syndrome or people
suspected they did. And the reason to not name names is that, it gets
right to the heart of whether or not they are male or female. How
could you say right? They have XY chromosomes but gonadally they have
testes that are inside. And yet, if you looked at their bodies if you
looked at their faces, you would say almost with certainty that they
appeared female. And that naturally occurring experiment, points to
the fact that testosterone that shows up in the body and impacts the
things that the levels of the receptor has a profound effect on
phenotype. On the external or body plan. So again, we're talking about
this in order to illustrate the principle that in order to have its
effects, a hormone doesn't just have to be present. That hormone
actually has to be able to bind its receptor and take action on the
target cells. And once again, I'll just throw out the example of where
people are using performance enhancing drugs. Although that's a pretty
broad statement, nowadays there's a lot of excitement about the so-
called SARMs. Who are more on the receptor side. And so we'll talk
about this in a future episode. And I just say that as a teaser
because the SARMs and what's happening right now in augmenting sports
performance, both with testosterone directly but also testosterone
derivatives and then also altering things at the level of the receptor
is exceedingly interesting and is revealing to us the many ways in
which hormones can impact brain and body. In ways that we didn't
suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=2921"&gt;Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the simplest way to understand how estrogen and testosterone
impact masculinization or feminization of the brain and behavior is
from a statement. It's actually the closing sentence of an abstract
that my colleague Neuronal Shaw at Stanford school of medicine
published. Which is that estrogen, again it's estrogen that is
aromatized from testosterone by aromatase, sets up the masculine
repertoire of sexual, and in animals and in humans, territorial
behaviors. So it sets up the circuitry in the brain. Estrogen does
that. Estrogen sets up the masculine circuitry in the brain and
testosterone is then what controls the display of those behaviors
later in life. And I find that incredibly interesting. You would think
it was just testosterone did one thing and estrogen did another, but
it turns out that nature is far more interesting than that. Okay, so
what are some things that impact sexual development early in life and
later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=2982"&gt;Cannabis, Alcohol: In Babies, Puberty &amp;amp; Adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about cannabis. Let's talk about alcohol and dare I say
let's talk about cell phones. Something that I never thought I would
ever do, either in this podcast or in the classroom. But, these days
there are really interesting data. And I think you should be aware of
them. First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC. I realize that there are
now a lot of different variance it's on this. There are a lot of
different strains of cannabis. I personally am not a pot smoker. It's
just not for me. I'm not talking about the moral or legal
implications, in some States it's decriminalized, in other places it's
really illegal and other places it's basically legal. You have to
check, you know where you live and understand the laws. That's not
what this is about. What we do know however, is that with the
exception of one study there are many studies that point to the fact
that THC and other things in cannabis promote significant increases in
aromatase activity. Now pot smokers aren't going to like this,
especially male pot smokers aren't going to like this but it's the
reality. Remember, what you're hearing in the background is Costello
snoring really loud? Should we put them on screen? He's not a cannabis
smoker, but you can imagine why. Come here Costello. Come here buddy,
come here. He's asleep. Come here. He's my [indistinct], there you go.
This dog definitely does not need cannabis. This is his state for most
of the time. He is highly... Oh he's asleep still. So some of you have
asked to see Costello if you're just listening on audio, maybe he'll
gives a [Costello grunts] Oh, okay. We're going to let him get back to
sleep. He's always here, some of you have asked to see him. Costello's
not a pot smoker either. He did have a dog sitter that was a pot
smoker years ago. It was his favorite dog sitter but, I'm not a pot
smoker. Again, no judgment. But here's the deal. That cannabis, and
it's not clear if it's THC itself or other elements in the marijuana
plant, promote aromatase activity. Now, this has been observed
anecdotally where pot smokers have a higher incidence of developing
something I mentioned before gynecomastia, breast bud development. Or
full-blown breast development in males. There may be some women who
want to increase their estrogenic activity. Remember females make
testosterone. It comes from the adrenals, right? They don't have
testes. So it comes from the adrenals and that testosterone can also
be aromatized. Although typically most of the aromatase activity that
we're referring to in these examples is in males. So testosterone can
increase estrogenic activity. So you might say, "Oh you know,
therefore does testosterone reduce sexual behavior? Does it create all
sorts of things that are related to low testosterone?" Not
necessarily, not necessarily. And here's why, estrogen itself in males
and females is important for things like libido and sexual behavior.
I'm going to repeat that. If estrogen is too low in males, it can
actually inhibit libido and sexual behavior. So you don't want
estrogen too high or too low. Whether or not you're male or female.
Now of course in females, estrogen levels tend to be higher than in
males. I'm speaking very generally here. You just think back to the
chromosomal sex. That's what I'm referring to when I say male or
female, although there's nuance there of course. In females, the
testosterone that comes from the adrenals has a powerful effect on
libido and desire to reproduce. And in the next episode, we're going
to talk about how that works and its relationship to birth control,
its relationship to menopause. We're also going to talk about how that
whole thing works in males as well. But cannabis and other aspects of
the marijuana plant can impact levels of testosterone and estrogen by
increasing aromatase. And so people should be aware of that. As well,
there are good data. I was able to find several studies on PubMed,
pointing to the fact that smoking marijuana during pregnancy can shift
the pattern of hormones in the developing fetus, such that it promotes
more estrogenic outcomes. Now earlier I said that estrogen is what
masculinized is the male brain, in utero that's true, but the way that
cannabis seems to work, at least from the studies I was able to
identify is that it promotes circulating estrogen in the body and
therefore can counteract some of the masculinizing effects of things
like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, on primary and secondary
sexual characteristics. So I mention this because, you know I think
nowadays marijuana use is far more widespread and certainly during
puberty it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems. And so
we'll do another episode, that goes really deep into this. But yes,
cannabis promotes estrogenic activity by increasing aromatase. Almost
everyone can appreciate that drinking during pregnancy, is not good
for the developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a well-established
negative outcome of pregnancy. And it's something that there are
cognitive effects that are really bad. There's actually physical
malformation, et cetera. So drinking during pregnancy, not good.
Probably drinking during puberty, not good either. Because alcohol, in
particular certain things like beer but other grain alcohols can
increase estrogenic activity. Now, this isn't just about protecting
young boys from estrogenic activity. It's also protecting girls from
excessive or even hypo estrogenic effects of alcohol in puberty. Now,
many teenagers drink. College students drink and it's important to
point out that puberty doesn't start on one day and end on another
day, puberty has a beginning a middle and an end, but development is
really our entire lifespan. This idea that you know, puberty you know
has this open and close. That's just false. Okay, so we talked about
cannabis. We talked about alcohol. Let's talk about cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=3385"&gt;Cell Phone Technology: Effects On Hormones, Ovaries, &amp;amp; Testicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I use a cell phone. I use it very often. And I do not
think they are evil devices. I think that they require some discipline
in order to make sure that it does not become a negative force in
one's life. So I personally restrict the number of hours that I'm on
the phone and in particular on social media. I only answer email at
particular times of day. But what about the cell phone itself? You
know, when I was a junior professor. I was a pre-tenure early
professor. I taught this class on neural circuits in health and
disease. And one of the students asked me, you know are cell phones
safe for the brain? And you know, all the data point to the fact that
they were. Or at least there were no data showing that it wasn't. I
still don't have the answer on that, frankly. I don't see a lot of
studies about it. I'm not personally aware of any evidence in quality
peer reviewed studies showing that cell phones are bad for the brain
or that holding the phone to the ear is bad or that Bluetooth is bad
or any of that. I'm just not aware of any quality studies. If you are
aware of quality studies, peer reviewed study please reference them,
put them in the comment section. Send them to me, however you like.
I'd love to see them. I'm not aware of them. However, I was very
interested in a particular study that was published back in 2013 on
rats. It was basically took a cell phone and put it under a cage of
rats and looked at basically testicular and ovarian development in
rats and saw minor but still statistically significant defects in
ovarian and testicular development. Since then and now returning to
the literature, I've seen a absolute explosion of studies. Some of
which are in quality journals, some of which are in what I would call
not to blue ribbon journals. Identifying defects in testicular and or
ovarian development by mere exposure to cell phone emitted waves.
Let's just call that, we don't know what they are. And this sounds
almost crazy, right? Anytime somebody starts talking about EMS and
things like that, you kind of worry like, is this person okay? But
look, the literature are pointing in a direction where chronic
exposure of the gonads to cell phones could be creating serious issues
in terms of the health at the cellular level and then in terms of the
output. So the output for the testes would be sperm production.
Swimming speed in sperm is an important feature of sperm health. In
the ovaries it would be estrogenic output. How regular the cycles are.
So in animals, the cycles are a little bit different than in humans.
They don't have a menstrual cycle. They have an estrous cycle, which
is a generally around four days. I think that it's to say based on the
literature, that there are effects of cell phone emitted waves on
gonadal development. The question is, what is the proximity of the
cell phone to the gonads? Now, I've taken the literature as I observe
it. And that of course we'll point you to in the captions. And I don't
like to have my cell phone on and in my pocket, I'm well past puberty,
but nonetheless some of these effects were seen in adult animals.
There are effects now that have been demonstrated in humans. So let's
just talk about a couple of those effects. So a paper published in the
journal, "Clinical Biochemistry" from S. Gander et al. Looked at
hormone profiles in people based on proximity to their phone and
frequency of phone use, where they stored their phone on their body.
Aa well as proximity of where they lived to, I guess they're called
these radio-frequency towers. So the base stations. And they were
looking at effects of radio frequency radiation RFR on human hormone
profiles. And they show significant decreases in cortisol. You might
say, "Well, that might be good." But you need that morning cortisol
bump in order to wake up. Morning cortisol is good. But also thyroid
hormones were significantly reduced. Prolactin in young females,
that's definitely concerning and testosterone levels in males and
females. And so, there are now quite good data showing that being
close to the phone too much of the day and how close is an interesting
question or living near one of these base stations apparently can have
effects on hormone profiles. And when you see a study like this one
should always ask, "Well, what are the other things that could also
have effects on these hormone profiles?" Right? Cause you could
imagine that if you ran the same study of people that live close to a
waterway, or close to a highway where there's a lot of exhaust from
buses and cars, you might see similar effects. So you have to take
these sorts of studies with a grain of salt. But I think it's very
interesting. And given that the last time I looked into these data
were way back when I was a junior professor and there was like one or
two studies that I could find. One of the studies pointed to increases
in testosterone in rats, where they were had close proximity to these
radio-frequency radiation waves. And then in the other case, it showed
decreases in testosterone. So there really wasn't any conclusion to
takeaway from that. Now, there's pretty impressive amount of data
pointing to the fact that there are effects of these things on
hormones. I don't know what to do with that information. I'm not going
to stop using my phone but, in light of the work from Tyrone Hayes and
others looking at sperm counts and looking at the decrease in
testosterone levels and sperm counts and fertility over the last 20,
30 years, perhaps it's you know, not surprising. Although there again,
cell phones and smartphones have really been in prominent use mostly
within the last 10 or 11 years. And so it's hard to explain all of
those declines simply on the basis of cell phone use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=3753"&gt;Beards &amp;amp; Baldness Patterns Around the World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some interesting effects of hormones that actually you can
observe on the outside of people, that tell you something about not
just their level of hormones, but also about their underlying
genetics. And these relate to beard growth and baldness. And it's
fascinating. The molecule, the hormone dihydrotestosterone, made from
testosterone, is the hormone primarily responsible for facial hair,
for beard growth. As well, it's the molecule, the hormone primarily
responsible for lack of hair on the head, for hair loss. So how does
that work? Well, DHT circulates in the body and it binds to DHT
receptors in the face to promote hair growth. But it binds to DHD
receptors on the scalp to promote hair loss. Not incidentally, the
drugs that are designed to prevent hair loss are 5-alpha-reductase
inhibitors. So remember 5-alpha-reductase from the Guevedoces? Well,
the people that discovered the Güevedoces, went on to do a lot of
research on the underlying biochemistry of this really interesting
molecule dihydrotestosterone. They identified 5-alpha-reductase. and
5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are the basis of most of the anti-hair
loss treatments that are out there. And so there's some interesting
things here. First of all, the side effect profiles of those
treatments for hair loss are quite severe in many individuals.
Remember DHT is the primary androgen for libido, for strengthened
connective tissue repair, for aggression. Even if that aggression of
course is held in check, but just sort of ambition and aggression is
related to dopamine, but within the testosterone pathway, less so pure
testosterone, although pure testosterone has its effects. But DHT is,
at least in primate species including humans, is the dominant androgen
for most of those sorts of effects. And if you look at somebody,
everyone can predict whether or not they're going to go bald based on
looking at their, we're always taught our mother's father. So if your
mother's father was bald, there's a higher probability that you're
going to go bald. The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp, will
dictate whether or not you're going to go bald everywhere or just in
the front or the so called crown type baldness. And the density of the
beard tells you about the density of DHT receptors. Now this varies by
background, by genetic background. And actually around the world
nowadays, because people travel and people form couples and have kids
with so many different people of different mixed cultures. You're
seeing this starting to disappear. But there are areas areas of the
world where all the men seem to have the same pattern of baldness,
like a strip of baldness down the center, with hair still on the sides
and and full beards. That's because these patterns of DHT receptors
are genetically determined. Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still
be very high, DHT levels in the blood can be very high and yet people
will have very light beards or no beards. And that's because they
don't have a lot of DHT receptors in the face. And in still other
cultures you'll see people with huge beard, tons of beard. Their
beards are growing all the way up to their eyes and they have huge
heads of hair. And that's because they have a lot of DHT receptors on
the face and not on the scalp. So there are a lot of effects of DHT
that you can just see in male phenotypes. And it's interesting that
these hair loss drugs that are, or to prevent hair loss drugs, are
directly aimed at preventing the conversion of testosterone into
dihydrotestosterone. And that's why they to some extent prevent hair
loss, but also to some extent have, a bunch of side effects that are
associated with low DHT. Along these lines there's a particular sports
supplement that a lot of people use called Creatine. Creatine, now
there's a lot of research showing that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=3999"&gt;Creatine &amp;amp; DHT/Hair Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine can bring more more water into the muscle. It can support
strength. It does a number of other things. Might even have some
important cognitive promoting. Cognitive enhancement effects, although
mild. The studies there show that it can be significant. Some people,
not all it's more anecdotal, report that creatine promotes hair loss.
It differs by individual. For some people that's true, for others no.
But yes it does appear, based on the studies I was able to find on
PubMed, that creatine does promote 5-alpha-reductase activity and
therefore the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. And
so it makes sense that it might promote some degree of hair loss, as
well as beard growth, as well as the other effects of DHT. I recall in
junior high school and middle school, going home one Summer it was
seventh grade, coming back in the eighth grade and a kid that I knew
that I was friends with, went from being like a young kid to, he was
like a grown man, he had a full beard. It was amazing. It was like he
would completely transformed. And in puberty as I've said before, is
without a doubt the most accelerated rate of development that we will
go through at any point in our lives. Even faster than infancy just in
terms of the huge number of different cognitive changes and physical
changes. Not surprisingly that same individual was mostly or bald by
his early twenties. And that's because he must have had just
exceedingly high levels of DHT. I also played soccer with this kid and
he was basically like dribbling past everybody. It who was like a
grown man, playing soccer with a bunch of little kids. Full beard you
know, bald at 20. And so the rate of maturation, the rate of aging is
very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=4100"&gt;Predicting Aging Rates By Pubertal Rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to know rate of aging. There's some genetic tests that now
can allow you to do that. Things like Horvath Clocks and things of
that sort. Beautiful work of David Sinclair at Harvard and others has
pointed to this. The speed of entry and exit from puberty might be,
I'm putting it out there as a hypothesis. Might be an interesting
window, into how fast one is going through their aging or
developmental arc. Because development of course, doesn't just start
at birth and end after puberty. It continues your entire life. So I
think it's interesting. You will often see that people, boys and
girls. I should say boys or girls, will develop secondary sexual
characteristics at different rates. And sometimes it's sequential. You
know you might see a kid will, she'll grow very tall or she'll have a
big growth spurt, but then breast development will come a little bit
later. And then other features will come a little bit later. You can
also see this in boys. The person that I referred to earlier, my
friend that developed a full beard, you know, went bald. He was also
quite muscular, he was a great athlete. So he went through puberty
exceedingly fast. Other people go through it more slowly. Some people
will go through puberty at age 14, but they won't start to accumulate
facial hair until much, much later. Or their voice will change first,
very early. And then they won't get the other secondary sexual
characteristics until much later. And so, we don't really know how
that impacts or relates to overall trajectory or rate of aging. But
it's an interesting thing to think about for each and every one of us.
I'm going to offer you the opportunity to do an experiment today,
while listening to the podcast. But first I want to tell you a story
about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=4204"&gt;Hyenas, Baseball, &amp;amp; Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hyenas, professional baseball and clitoris's the size of penises. So
when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley, we had a professor in
our department, phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman. Steve
Glickman, had a colony of hyenas, spotted hyenas that lived, within
caged enclosures of course, in Tilden Park behind the UC Berkeley
campus. The enclosures are actually still there. I run past there
fairly often. The hyenas are no longer there. This was a Federally
Funded field station. These animals were brought over from Africa or
were bred there. And the reason why they were hyenas in Tilden Park,
enclosed in Tilden Park. Was because hyenas exhibit an incredible
feature to their body, their hormones and their social structure.
Hyenas, unlike many species, have a situation with their genitalia
where the male penis is actually smaller than the female clitoris. And
I should say that the male penis itself, having seen a fair number of
hyena penises, is not particularly small. Which means that the hyena
clitoris's are extremely large. This was well known for some time. It
turns out that in these spotted hyenas the females are dominant. So
after a kill the females will eat, then they're young will eat. And
then the male hyenas will eat. As well, when the female hyena gives
birth, she gives birth, not through the vaginal canal that we're
accustomed to seeing, but through a very enlarged clitoris's like
phallus. Although it's not a phallus, it's a clitoris. And it
literally splits open. So many fetuses die during the course of hyena
development and birth. These animals have this, what could only be
described as a very large or giant clitoris. Although for a hyena it's
not giant, it's normal. And it splits open and the baby actually comes
through. The baby hyena actually comes through the tissue and it's
it's a very traumatic birth. A lot of tissue is torn away, et cetera.
And as I mentioned, a lot of baby hyenas die. It was a mystery as to
how the female hyenas have this we'll call it masculinization, but
it's really a androgen jet. Excuse me, androgenization of the
periphery. Of the genitalia. And it turns out, through a lot of
careful research done by Steve Glickman, Christine Drey and others.
That it's androstenedione. What is essentially a pro hormone to
testosterone? It's androstenedione at very high levels that's produced
in female hyenas that creates this enlargement of their genitalia. So
if you want to read up on androstenedione. Androstenedione is made
into testosterone through this enzyme 17-beta-hydroxy steroid
dehydrogenase it's a complicated pathway to pronounce. It's a fairly
straightforward pathway biochemically. You may recall during the 90's
and 2000's there were a lot of performance enhancing drug scandals, in
particular in Major League Baseball. And it was purported, although I
don't know that it was ever verified. But it was purported that the
major performance enhancing drug of abuse at that time, in particular
players whose names we won't mention but you can Google it if you want
to find out. Was androstenedione. And I actually recall long ago, when
you could buy androstenedione in the health food stores. And so it was
sold over the counter. So a lot's changed since then. But it's
interesting that these hyenas, with these highly androgenized
genitalia accomplish that through high levels of androstenedione in
the females. Now if that's unusual,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=4466"&gt;Intersex Moles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what might be even more unusual is that a graduate student that I was
working with at the time. Alongside we didn't share research. Her name
was Nicola Sitka. She is actually a trained behavioral, animal
behavioral expert. She had trained ferrets for that show the
"BeastMaster." And she had trained wolves for television shows and was
a dog trainer. She had these two large dogs that, unlike my dog would
actually listen to her when she would give them commands. A remarkable
scientist. She was studying a species of mole that also lived in
Tilden Park. People are going to start to wonder about Tilden Park,
what's in Tilden Park? But this particular mole that lived there had
testes for part of the year and had the capacity to trans
differentiate its testes into ovaries in order to balance out the
ratio of males and females in the population to keep reproduction at
appropriate levels for that certain population. So some animals are
actually able to adjust whether or not they have androgenized or
estrogenized gonads, in order to adjust the ratios of offspring or the
males and females in therefor promote offspring. And the last little
anecdote about this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=4540"&gt;Marijuana Plants, Pollens: Plant-To-Animal “Warfare”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is also published in the scientific literature, which is weird
but I do find interesting. Hormones are so fascinating, they're just
incredible to me is going back to the marijuana plant. You know, the
marijuana plant has these estrogenic properties. And I asked a plant
biologist whether or not this was unusual. And I asked because there's
all this stuff out there about, "Oh, you know, Soy does this. And
these plants are highly estrogenic, et cetera." Although we should
probably point out that a lot of factory meats are also estrogenic. So
this isn't a meat versus plants thing. But this plant biologist told
me, "Oh yeah, there are plants that make what is essentially the
equivalent of testosterone like pine pollen as it looks a lot like
testosterone. And there are other plants that make what is essentially
estrogen. And I said, "Well, why would they do that?" Well and you
know plants, at least as far as I know, don't have a consciousness.
They don't have a brain. They don't have neurons even but, his answer
was fascinating. He said that, one of the reasons why some plants have
evolved this capacity to increase estrogen levels in animals that
smoke, not smoke it but then animals that consume them. I'm guessing
that animals aren't smoking marijuana. Although I don't know, send me
the paper if you've heard of this. Is that plants have figured out
ways. They've adapted ways to push back on populations of rodents and
other species of animals that eat them. So plants are engaged in a
kind of plant to animal warfare where they increase the estrogen of
the males in that population to lower the sperm counts, to keep those
populations clamped at certain levels so that those plants can
continue to flourish. Even if those animals are reproducing very
robustly. And I find this just fascinating. And hormones therefore,
aren't just impacting tissue growth and development within the
individual and between the mother. Remember the placenta is an
endocrine organ, and the offspring, but plants and animals are in this
communication. And today we're in this communication, I'm telling you
that there are certain herbicides that humans are using for which
there's very good data, are disrupting the endocrine pathways. And so
it's fascinating that humans and other animals, we're always in this
interplay with plants and the other things in our environment. And
hormones and adjusting the hormone levels of animals and plants is one
way in which the environment kind of pushes back or pushes forward if
you will, in terms of promoting their well-being and longevity, as
well as you trying to promote your wellbeing and longevity. If anyone
wants to see the incredible paper by Steve Glickman and colleagues. It
was published in the proceedings of the national Academy. First in
1987, that's Glickman et al. That was the hypothesis that it was
androstenedione . And then if you just Google Glickman hyenas science
magazine, there's a beautiful cover article and feature all about that
important discovery, it's a fascinating one. And I should mention also
that those discoveries, both the moles and the hyenas weren't just
impactful for the world of animal behavior and endocrinology, they've
also strongly impacted understanding of conditions that show up in the
clinic, which we haven't talked about today. Which is actually pseudo
hermaphroditism. Occasionally babies will be born where it is unclear,
if they are boys or girls based on the genitalia. And this has a very
important ethical and other issues. Do you raise them as a boy or a
girl? It's not super uncommon for this to happen. And there have been
terrible cases where people have gone against the chromosomal sex. And
the person was very unhappy with the the choice that their parents had
made for them. There were also cases where they've gone with a
chromosomal sex and the person was very happy about the outcome.
There've been cases where they've been treated with hormones and there
been cases where they have not been treated with hormones. It's a
complicated literature and it has to be sorted out on kind of a case
by case basis, but it is something that does happen. And the studies
on androstenedione in hyenas and in these very interesting moles,
pseudo-hermaphroditic moles that live in Tilden Park, have impacted
not just the science but the therapeutics around those important
issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=4808"&gt;Finger Length Ratios, Prenatal Hormone Exposure &amp;amp; Sexual Orientation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now last but not least, I want to discuss the effects of hormones
while you and I were separately in utero and the effects that that had
on who we are, who we select as mates. So mate choice, sexual
preference. And all other aspects of what you would call sexual
development. Now this is something that's gotten a lot of popular
press and it has to do with how exposure to androgens in particular
while we were in utero, impacted whether or not people report as
homosexual, heterosexual, identify as male or female. I'm very
familiar with this work because I was a graduate student in the
department that first published this work and I'm an author on the
paper. I was not the main driver of the work, but I was involved in
the work. And I certainly know the people that did this work. First it
starts with a story. There was a researcher who's still going now. His
name is Dennis McFadden. I believe he was at UT Austin back then. And
he was studying the auditory system. And people would come into his
clinic and he would, or his laboratory. And he would look at hearing
and he would explore different aspects of what they call the
psychophysics of hearing and understanding hearing thresholds and
frequency thresholds. And he made several observations. And those
observations were that young males tended to have what are called auto
acoustic emissions, more often than young females did. Auto acoustic
emissions, as the name suggests, are the ears actually making sounds.
Now these sounds have to be picked up by a special apparatus, because
they can hear into that frequency. But it turns out that your ears
don't just take sound waves and convert them into this thing we call
hearing. But they also in some cases make sound. So your ears are
making sounds. Strange right? So it turns out that there's a sex
difference in auto acoustic emissions. It turns out also that people
that self-report as lesbians, they also have auto acoustic emissions
significantly more than females that don't self-report as lesbian. And
Dennis noticed this and published this. And it was an important
discovery because it was one of the first discoveries that pointed to
the fact that there are sex differences in biology that are
independent of sex. I mean, this is hearing and auto acoustic
emissions. And just to really illustrate what that. What the former
problem was and why this study was so important? You know, a lot of
people had explored for instance whether or not, homosexuals had lower
testosterone for instance in males. And actually the result often was
the opposite. That gay men or men that self-report is gay, often had
much higher testosterone. And those studies then became controversial
because people said, "Well, sexual behavior can relate to
testosterone," et cetera. And so it became very controversial. And
then there were some studies that attempted to look at the equivalent
phenomenon in people that self report as lesbian. Or self-report as
heterosexual. And so it became very complicated. But this was an
identification of a phenomenon, auto acoustic emissions, that was
independent of anything that had to do with sexual or even social
behavior. 1998 rolls around. And I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley
and a guy by the name of Mark Breedlove. Kind of an ironic name, given
that he worked on. He worked and still works on sexual dimorphism in
the brain and in the spinal cord and nervous system. And Mark, who's a
phenomenal scientist comes running down the hall. I'll never forget
this. And he said, "Give me your hands." I was like, [indistinct].
He's like, "Give me your hands." And he pulls out a ruler and he
starts measuring my fingers. And he takes down a couple of
measurements and then he goes away. And I was like, "What was that?"
Well, I was in a course that Mark was teaching at that point. And soon
after, we did a study that Mark directed exploring the finger length
ratios. And I'll explain what those are. Of males and females, and
people that self-reported as homosexual or heterosexual. So let's just
get to the basic, what we'll call sex differences first. These are
averages. I want to point out. Anytime you get into this kind of
topic, people assume it's causal, but it's not causal. These are
averages that I'm about to report. It is the case that the ratio of
what's called the D2 to D4 digits. So the D2 is your index finger. So
your thumb is D1. Then D2 would be your index finger that you would
point with. Middle finger is D3, which you whatever with. And then D4
is the so-called ring finger. Okay and D5 is the pinky. It is the case
that the D2 to D4 ratio is greater in self-reported females than it is
in males. What does that mean? It means that digit D4 and D4 are more
similar in length in females than in men males. And that effect is
particularly, excuse me, pronounced on the right hand. Although not
always, okay? And it does not have to do with handedness. This D2 to
D4 difference has to be measured correctly. You can't just look at
somebody who's hands and say, "Oh, their ring finger and index finger
are very similar. And therefore they are female you know. Or they were
exposed to very little testosterone in utero." You can't look at
somebody and see that their index finger is much shorter than their
ring finger and say, "Oh, they must've been exposed to a lot of
androgen." You have to actually measure it and you have to measure it
correctly. You have to measure it from the base of the finger where
there's that first crease, all the way to the tip past the. You can't
include the fingernails. If you're growing fingernails, it'd be
logical here folks. So you can't normally see it from the back of the
hand. Although, I don't know if this'll show up here but if you look
at the back of the hand sometimes you can see it. You know, in my case
for instance. Let me see if I can do this. So my D4 is a little bit
longer than my D2. In some people it's more pronounced and that's on
my right hand. On the other hand, the difference actually is far less
pronounced. Is it's a little bit. it's a little bit pronounced there,
but not so much okay? So that's sort of the typical ratio that you
would see. It turns out that in mice and in humans, the more androgen
that you were exposed to in utero, the smaller the D4 D2 ratio.
Meaning that the ring finger tends to be slightly longer than the
pointer finger. And in females because they're exposed to less
androgen in utero typically. Then those fingers tend to be more equal
in length. And these are subtle differences and these are averages. I
invite you to look up the paper. This was published in Nature in 2000
and it's been replicated six times. Now, here's where it gets even
more interesting. And potentially precarious, so we're going to step
cautiously here. If you look at the finger length ratios of men that
self-report as homosexual, they have either the typical male pattern
of D2 to D4 ratio or a hyper masculinized D4 to D2 ratio. Now this
can't be something that's established or modified by behavior. This
has to be something that was established in utero. And in fact, it's
present at birth okay? So it completely divorces the interactions
between hormones and behavior. And that's an important theme that
we've been talking about. And we're going to talk about even more.
Next episode is that hormones impact behavior but behavior also impact
hormones. But this is a case of hormones impacting what really should
be considered a primary sexual characteristic. Because it doesn't show
up in puberty, it shows up before puberty. It's actually established
in utero. And in people that self-reported lesbians. And I remember
going out there and collecting these data with, with the collaborators
on this work. Again, I wasn't the main driver on the work. But I
participated in some of the analysis. People that self-report as
lesbians also tend to have a smaller D2 to D4 ratio. So this is
consistent with the auto acoustic emission study that Dennis McFadden
had published. And it points to the fact that early exposure to
androgens may have an impact, not just on androgenization of the body
plan, but also separately on sexual preference. Now, this raises all
sorts of interesting questions about biological basis of sexual
preference. I'll tell you about another study. A guy named Simon LeVay
who was at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=5353"&gt;Brain Dimorphisms with Sexual Orientation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who trained under Hubel and Wiesel. If any of you remember early
episodes on "Plasticy," David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel my scientific
great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize for discovery of critical
periods for brain plasticity. They defined some of the most important
aspects of how we see and brain plasticity. Simon LeVay trained with
them. And then Simon went on to discover that in the brains of people
that self-report homosexual there is a brain difference. And the brain
difference is in an area called the Interstitial Nucleus of the
Anterior Hypothalamus. So it's the INAH. And so there are published
reports. That was published in Science. The other work I refer to as
published in Nature, and then replicated no fewer than six times. And
the McFadden results that point to strong biological correlates of
mate choice, of sexual preference. And these tie directly to things
like androgenization or estrogenization. Meaning we could call it
maleness or femaleness, but that's sort of tricky territory. Because
of the way that we described the huge range in which sex can be
defined earlier. So, if you want to measure your D2 D4 ratio you're
welcome to, but you also have to understand that it's not predictive
of anything, right? It's just a window into the possible androgen
exposure that you had early in life. There are plenty of men who
report themselves as heterosexual who are out there who have similar
or have D2 D4 ratios to females. And there are plenty of females whose
index fingers are shorter than their ring fingers. And they're
perfectly happy where they say they're perfectly happy. And we are
inclined to believe them being heterosexual. So there's variation. In
fact, Mark tells a really good joke. If you want to know whether or
not somebody is homosexual or heterosexual, simply look at their
hands, look at their D2 D4 ratio and guess heterosexual. And you'll be
right 96% of the time. Because 96% of the time people report
themselves as heterosexual on average. Those numbers might be
changing. So the joke really is a joke on science because, that falls
within the realm of statistical significance. And yet it really
illustrates the fact that none of this is causal. But it's nonetheless
very interesting because it means that hormones are organizing the
brain early in development in ways that can potentially impact same or
opposite sex partner choice later in life. Now of course, there are
other things that can impact opposite sex or same-sex partner choice
later in life. The study did not look at people who reported bisexual.
There hasn't been a lot of studies on that yet. One thing that's very
interesting, for which there are some good scientific data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=5520"&gt;“Older Brother Effects”: Male Fetuses Might Change Mothers &amp;amp; Subsequent Brothers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there's also some controversy is that, it appears that the
probability of a male human self-reporting as homosexual, increases
with the number of older brothers that he has. Now, that doesn't mean
if you have an older brother or even if you have 10 older brothers,
that you are sure to self-report as homosexual. But statistically it
becomes more likely that somebody will with each successive older
brother that they have. And the idea that starting to emerge, in the
developmental neuroendocrinology landscape is that there's a record
within the mother of how many male fetuses she's carried, because male
fetuses are secreting certain things, dihydrotestosterone, other
things, that can feed back on to the genome. So these could be
epigenomic effects or onto the placenta itself, so that there's a
higher probability in subsequent pregnancies that offspring will self-
report as homosexual. So it's a fascinating area of biology. And as
you've noticed today, none of this deals with the current
controversies around gender and how many genders and sex, et cetera
That's a separate conversation that is by definition grounded in the
kind of concepts we've been talking about today and needs to take
place, taking into consideration all of the aspects of sex and the
effects of hormones, both on the body, on the brain. We didn't talk a
lot about spinal cord, but we will in the next episode. But we can
just say on the brain and the periphery, early effects, late effects,
acute effects, meaning effects that are very fast of levels of
hormones going up or down. Something that absolutely happens during
and across the menstrual cycle. As well as long-term effects like the
effects of these hormones on gene expression. So today, as always, we
weren't able to cover all things related to sex and hormones and
sexual differentiation or development. There's no way we could. But we
have covered a lot of material. We talked about some effects of
environmental toxins. We talked about potential effects of cell phone
radiation. Something I never thought that I would be talking about,
especially not in a podcast. But for which there are interesting
emerging data. We talked about considerations about Evening Primrose
Oil and its estrogenic effects. About Creatine and its pro DHT
effects. About cannabis, alcohol. About plants exerting warfare on
animals by increasing aromatase. The conversion of testosterone to
estrogen. We talked about hyenas with giant clitoris's. And we talked
about moles that can revert from having ovaries to testicles. And
throughout this Costello has been snoring nonstop. He missed all of
it. Although he might be learning it in his sleep for all I know. And
I do understand it's a lot of information, a lot of detail as always.
I just want to remind you, you don't have to absorb all the
information at once. Next episode, we are going to be talking about
the science of sex, the verb, actual reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7SrAEacyf8&amp;amp;t=5706"&gt;The Path Forward &amp;amp; A Warning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also going to be talking about effects of hormones on various
aspects of behavior and ways to modulate hormones, through the use of
behavior, supplementation. Also we'll touch on diet and nutrition a
bit. And we're going to talk about interactions between those things
and behavior, as they relate to important themes like sex and
reproduction. Like workplace performance. Like motivation and drive
and even anxiety. There's a very interesting relationship between
hormones and anxiety and the desire to explore novelty. So just to
remember as we go forward that, hormones affect behavior and behavior
affects hormones. But that doesn't mean that cutting off your index
finger will increase your testosterone. Many of you have asked how you

partnered with Thorne. T-H-O-R-N-E. And we've partnered with Thorne
because, Thorne has the highest level of stringency with respect to
the ingredients that they put in their products. As well as the
precise amounts of those contents. You know, a lot of supplement
brands out there claim to have X amount of some supplement, but then
when people have measured the amount in capsules and tablets, it's
turned out to be very different. Thorne is very precise about this.
They partnered with important and stringent institutions like the Mayo
Clinic, all the major sports teams. So that's why we partnered with
Thorne. If you want to try any of Thorne's products, if you want to
see what I take you can go to Thorne that's thorne.com/u/huberman And

&lt;p&gt;[Andrew Huberman] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we
discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. My name is
Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my
teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my
desire and effort to bring zero-cost to consumer information about
science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping
with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized
nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help
you better understand your body and inform your health goals. I'm a
big believer in getting blood test taken, because it's simply the only
way to get in-depth data about your metabolic factors, hormones, all
the things that inform your immediate and long-term health. Nowadays,
there are also excellent DNA tests that can further inform you about
your immediate and long-term health. Now the problem with most blood
tests out there is that you get information back, you get a lot of
numbers, and they'll tell you whether or not your numbers are in
normal range or high or low, but they don't inform you what steps to
take as a consequence. In addition, they can often be very confusing,
what all the factors are and what they really mean. InsideTracker has
a dashboard and a platform that makes interpreting all that
information really easy. It also points you in the direction of
certain lifestyle factors, exercise, nutrition et cetera, that you
might want to change in order to bring the numbers into the ranges
that you want. So InsideTracker is something that I've been doing for
some time now, and it's really helped me inform the choices. For
instance, I've swapped out some of the foods that I was eating
regularly. I found out I was actually too high in certain vitamins and
minerals, I was too low in others. It's really helped me adjust my
diet and my exercise regimes. And it really gives me the confidence
that I'm on the path to long-term health. So if you want to try
InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off
any of InsideTracker's plans. Use the code Huberman at checkout,
that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of InsidTracker's

ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN is a virtual private network that keeps your
data safe and secure and private. It does that by routing your
internet activity through their servers and encrypting it so that no
one can see or sell your data. I started using ExpressVPN because my
bank account got hacked. I still don't know exactly how it happened,
but it was an absolute mess. I lost money, I lost a lot of time. I
wouldn't want to have it happen to anybody. When that happened, I
talked to my friends in the tech community and they told me that even
though you think your internet connection is secure oftentimes it's
not. So I tend to use internet connections on planes, in hotels, in
cafes, but also at home. And I was told that even at home, your data
may not be as secure as you think. And so with ExpressVPN, your data
is absolutely secure, so are your online activities. The great thing
is you don't even notice that it's operating, it's running in the
background. You just turn it on and it goes without you realizing that
your data is being protected, it doesn't interfere with any of your
online activities. So I use ExpressVPN when I travel, anytime I'm
outside the house, when I'm at work and when I'm at home. If you want
to try ExpressVPN, you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman. And if you
do that, you'll get an extra three months free on one of their one-
year packages. That's expressvpn.com/huberman to get three months free
on a one-year package. The final sponsor of today's podcast is Magic
Spoon. Magic Spoon is a zero-sugar, grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.
As I've mentioned before on the podcast, I'm neither ketogenic, nor am
I all-meat, nor am I vegan. The way I eat is that early in the day I
fast, and then sometime around noon I eat my first meal, and that meal
is always low carbohydrate, and then throughout the day, I maintain a
low carbohydrate diet. The fasting and low carbohydrate diet during
the daytime optimizes alertness and wakefulness, I want to be awake
and be able to work. And then at night is when I eat my carbohydrates,
'cause it facilitates the transition to sleep. So for me, Magic Spoon
is a terrific snack in the afternoon. I'll sometimes even have it with
lunch. And the reason I like it is because it tastes really delicious,
and it's compatible with the keto-friendly or keto-like meals that I
eat throughout the day. They come in a variety of flavors, cocoa,
fruity, peanut butter, frosted. I particularly like the frosted
because it tastes like donuts, in my opinion, and I love donuts. As a
consequence, I love Magic Spoon cereal. I can consume it. It tastes
like a pastry and it has zero grams of sugar, and it's compatible with
this nutritional regimen I mentioned earlier. If you want to try Magic
Spoon, you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman to grab a variety pack.

month, we're talking all about the science of emotions and tools
related to the science of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=310"&gt;Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've talked about the science of stress and resiliency, tools to
access more calm, tools raise your stress threshold, to become more
resilient. We've talked about motivation and the role of the dopamine
system. I'd like to make a couple of announcements about some new
resources. The first one is that we have now captioned all the
Huberman Lab episodes in English and in Spanish. We were able to do
that, thanks to your support of our sponsors and on Patreon. So now,
all of the podcasts have a captioning feature on YouTube, and those
were done by experts. So while there might be the occasional error,
for the most part, they're very precise. We've done that so that
people that prefer to consume the content in Spanish or that like to
read the content from the English subtitles can do so. And we're going
to continue to expand the number of languages that are captioned for
the Huberman Lab Podcast. So we want to thank you for that resource.
It's now available for all episodes. In addition, in previous episodes
I've talked about NSDR or non-sleep depressed. NSDRs come in in a
variety of different forms, there's self-hypnosis. I've pointed you to
some resources for that previously. There's yoga nidra. NSDR is really
about achieving calm quickly, and doing that in a self-directed way,
for many reasons, in order to access sleep more readily, in order to
de-stress very deeply, in order to replace sleep that you've lost. It
also seems to aid neuroplasticity. It can enhance the rearrangements
of connections in the brain that occur during learning, there's
scientific support for that. There's a link in today's episode caption
to a new site. This is a YouTube video that was brought free of cost
by the folks over at Madefor, a company that's been a sponsor of the
podcast previously. So this is an NSDR script that doesn't contain any
of the intentions or some of the more typical language of yoga nidra,
instead it's focused purely on the breathing protocols, as well as
includes a sort of body scan where you direct your attention to
different locations around your body. It has all the core elements of
non-sleep deep rest, but is distinct from yoga nidra. I just offer
this to you as a resource. If you'd like to use it, it's about 30
minutes long, and should be very effective in bringing you into deep
states of relaxation for all the reasons I mentioned before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=460"&gt;Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about emotions. Emotions are a fascinating and vital
aspect of our life experience. It's fair to say that emotions make up
most of what we think of as our experience of life, even the things we
do, our behaviors and the places we go, and the people we end up
encountering in our life, all of that really funnels into our
emotional perception of what those things mean, whether or not they
made us happy or sad or depressed or lonely, or were all inspiring.
Now one thing that is absolutely true is that everyone's perception of
emotion is slightly different. Meaning, your idea of happy is very
likely different than my idea of what a state of happiness is. And we
know this also for color vision, for instance, even though the cells
in your eye and my eye that perceive the color red are identical right
down to the genes that they express, we can be certain based on
experimental evidence, and what are called psychophysical studies,
that your idea of the most intense red is going to be very different
than my idea of the most intense red if we were given a selection of
10 different reds and asked which one is most intense, which one looks
most red, and that seems crazy, you would think that something as
simple as color would be universal, and yet it's not. And so we need
to agree at the outset that emotions are complicated and yet they are
tractable. They can be understood. And today we're going to talk about
a lot of tools to understand what emotions are for you to understand
what your emotional states mean and what they don't mean. And in doing
that, that will allow you to place value on whether or not you should
hold an emotional state as true or not true, whether or not it has
meaning or it doesn't, as well as whether or not the emotions of
others are important to you in a given context. We're going to talk a
lot about development. In fact, we're going to center a lot of our
discussion today around infancy and puberty. We're also going to talk
about tools for enhancing one's emotional range and for navigating
difficult emotional situations. I'm not a clinical psychologist, I'm
not a therapist, but I do have some background in psychology. And
today I'm going to be drawing from the psychology greats, not me, but
from the greats of psychology who studied emotion, who studied
emotional development, and linking that to the neuroscience of
emotion. Because nowadays we understand a lot about the chemicals and
the hormones and the neural circuits in the brain and body that
underlie emotion. So while there's no one single universally true
theory of emotion, at the intersection of many of the existing
theories, there are really some ground truth. So today we're going to
visit those ground truths. We're going to talk about the tools that
emerge from them. And we're going to talk about some absolutely wild
and wacky experiments that people are doing out there right now, that
I don't necessarily recommend you do, of inhaling different types of
hormones and trying to get attached more quickly. You're actually
going to do some experiential stuff today if you like. There's some
things that you can do in real time while listening to the podcast, in
order to tap into some of the mechanisms that I'll be referring to. So
today's going to be very interactive in a way that previous podcast
episodes have not. If we want to understand emotions,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=653"&gt;To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy &amp;amp; Puberty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have to look at where emotions first develop. In fact, this is a
critical central theme if you want to understand brain science and
psychology. There's a rule in neuroanatomy. Because if you look at 50
different brains of humans or you compare the brains of dogs and
humans, there are a lot of differences. Certain things are the same
but certain things are different. And the rule that every good
neuroanatomist knows is that if you want to understand what a part of
the brain does, you have to address two questions. First, you have to
know what connections does that brain area make? What is it connected
to? Where does it get inputs from and where does it send inputs? So
for instance, if there's an area of the brain that gets direct input
from the neurons in the nose, you can be pretty certain that it has
some role in analyzing smell in measuring something about odors or
analyzing something about odors. Now if it also gets input from the
eye, you can also conclude that it gets input from the visual system
that it cares about light and photons. This is sort of obvious. And
yet you need to know that connectivity, and you need to know what's
called the developmental origin of that structure. You need to know
where it was early in development, because things move around a lot as
the brain develops. The brain, of course is this more or less squishy
thing floating around in some liquid that stuffed inside your skull.
And as a consequence, things move around a lot. They are not always in
the same place in two different species or two individuals of the same
species. So you have to know where they started out, because where
they started out informs what they do as well. And when we're talking
about emotions, we cannot point to one area of the brain. We can't say
that's the area of the brain that's responsible for emotions. There is
this so-called limbic system that has been linked to emotions in
various ways. We're going to talk about that today. But the limbic
system is just one component of the inputs to create emotions. It's
not the place for emotions. You can't go in and lesion one location in
the brain and eliminate emotions entirely, just doesn't work that way.
So, first of all, we have to ask, what are the circuits for emotion?
What are the brain areas for emotion? And nowadays there's a lot of
debate about this. For years, it was thought that there might be
circuits, meaning connections in the brain that generate the feeling
of being happy or circuits that generate the feeling of being sad, et
cetera. That's been challenged. In fact, Lisa Feldman Barrett has been
the person who's really challenged this head-on, and has very good
evidence for the fact that such circuits probably don't exist. And yet
I think there's good evidence for circuits in the brain, such as
limbic circuits and other circuits that shift our overall states or
our overall level of alertness or calmness, or whether they're not,
they bias us toward viewing the outside world or paying more attention
to what's going on inside our bodies. If none of this makes sense
right now, I promise it will make sense soon. But the important thing
to understand is that emotions do arise in the brain and body. They
arise because there are specific connections between specific areas in
the brain and body. And if we want to understand how emotions work, we
have to look how emotions are built. And they are built during
infancy, adolescence, and puberty, and then it continues into
adulthood. But the groundwork is laid down early in development when
we are small children. So let's think about what happens to a baby
that comes into the world. A baby comes into the world. You were born
into this world without really any understanding of the things around
you. Now, there are two ways that you can interact with the world and
you're always doing them more or less to some degree at the same time.
Those are interoception, paying attention what's going on inside you,
what you feel internally, and exteroception, paying attention to
what's going on outside you. Hold that in mind, please. Because the
fact that you're both interocepting and exterocepting is true for your
entire life, and it sets the foundation for understanding emotions.
It's absolutely critical. As an infant, you didn't have any knowledge
of what you needed. You didn't understand hunger, you didn't
understand toys when you first came into the world, you didn't
understand cold or heat or any of that. When you needed something, you
experienced that as anxiety. You would feel an increase in alertness
if you had to use the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=921"&gt;Your First Feeling Was Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you would feel an increase in alertness if you were hungry, and you
would vocalize, you would cry out, you would act agitated. You might
cue, you might do a number of different things, but all you knew was
what you were feeling internally. And then your caregiver, whoever
that might've been would respond to that. So you would feel some
agitation, a caregiver would come and make a decision, Oh, you need
food, and give you milk, or change your diaper or wrap you in a
blanket if you were cold, but they didn't know if you were cold, they
could just assume that you were cold. So this is actually really
important to understand that a baby, when you were a baby, and when I
was a baby, we didn't have any sense of the outside world except that
it responded to our acts of anxiety essentially. Now this isn't
Freudian theory, There are components of it that are embedded in
Freudian theory, but all developmental psychologists agree that babies
lack the ability to make cognitive sense of the outside world, but in
this feeling of anxiety and registering one's own internal state, and
then crying out to the outside world, either through crying or subtle
vocalizations, or even just cuing, making some noise, we start to
develop a relationship with the outside world in which our internal
states, our shifts and anxiety start to drive requests, and people
come and respond to those requests, hopefully. And the reason I say
hopefully is that we've all heard presumably about these cases of
neglect. There are a lot of cases where if you neglect a baby, you
neglect an adolescent or a teenager, development doesn't go well, and
we'll touch on some of those. But those are really extreme cases.
They're sort of like the parallel to experiments that are often done
in the laboratory with animals, where you've probably heard of these
enriched environments where they'll give mice a bunch of toys, and
they'll give them some different foods every once in a while, and
they'll house them together with other mice. And then what you find is
that the animals, they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker and their
neurons have more branches to them and all that." But that's really
comparing deprivation with normalcy. What we want to center on today
instead is what happens when things go well, and why things might not
go well in certain circumstances is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=1056"&gt;What Are “Healthy Emotions”?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to me, not as interesting as what healthy emotional development
looks like. And if you haven't achieved healthy emotional development,
what can be done as an intervention at later times in order to rescue
that? So the baby, you as a baby, you're flopping around there in your
crib, you're getting care where you need it and when you need it,
presumably, and this gets to the basis of what emotions are about,
which are emotions are really about forming bonds and being able to
predict things in the world. That's really what emotions are about.
Whether or not the baby feels angry or happy or sad, we don't know, we
can guess, but we don't know. In fact, most of the time we don't even
know how we feel, let alone how other people feel, and that's true for
adults. So if I asked you how you feel right now, I don't know that
you could tell me in any kind of rich language that I would say, "Oh I
really understand." If you said you were very, very depressed or very,
very happy, I'd have some sense because of how extreme that is, but I
don't know that I would really know, and I don't think you know how I
feel right now either. I could be furious right now or I could be very
happy, you don't have any idea. And of course, we have these things
called expressions, our pupils dilate. There are various cues of how
people feel. We're going to talk about those cues, but you really
don't know. And at this point I actually just want to pause and
mention a really interesting tool that is trying to address this
question of what are emotions and what do they consist of, that you
can use if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=1143"&gt;Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an app, I didn't develop it, I don't have any relationship to
them, but the app was developed by people at Yale, by groups at Yale
who do research, and it's called Mood Meter. And it's actually quite
interesting. I think it's either free or it's 0.99. Again, no business
relationship to them. But what they're trying to do is put more
nuance, more subtlety on our words, and our language for emotions, and
be able to allow you to predict how you're going to feel in the
future. And it's actually quite interesting. I'm on the app right now,
and I know you can't see this, but it's called Mood Meter. And you can
find on Apple or Android. And you go into and it asks you, it says to
me, "Hi, Andrew, how are you right now? And I click the little tab
that says I feel. And I can either pick high energy and unpleasant,
high energy and pleasant, low energy unpleasant or low energy
pleasant. And I would say right now I feel high energy pleasant. So I
just revealed to you how I feel. So I click on that, and then it gives
you a gallery of colors, and you just move your finger to the location
where you think it matches most. And as you do that, little words pop
up. I know some people are listening to this on audio only. So it say
motivated, cheerful, inspired. I would say, I'm feeling right now,
cheerful. So you click that and then you just go to the next window,
and it just says, what are you doing? And this feels like play to me,
but I'm going to call it work. And then that's it. And then what it
does is it basically starts to collect data on you. You're giving it
information. And it starts to link that to other features that you
allowed access to if you like, and it starts helping you be able to
predict how you're going to feel different times a day. It's actually
quite accurate in certain ways, quite interesting. And it points to a
couple of really interesting features, which is that we don't really
have enough language to describe all the emotional states, and yet
there's some core truths to what makes up an emotion. And I want to
review that twice during today's podcast, because this can really help
people,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=1268"&gt;The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kids and adults understand better what they're feeling and why, and
when best to engage in certain activities, and thankfully, when best
to avoid certain activities too. So the way this works is the
following. You need to ask yourself at any point, you could do this
right now if you like, what's your level of autonomic arousal?
Autonomic arousal is just the continuum, the range of alert to calm.
So if you're in a panic right now, you are like 10 out of 10 on the
arousal scale. If you're asleep, you're probably not comprehending
what I'm saying, although maybe a little bit. But let's say you're
very drowsy, you might be at a one or a two. So you always have to
ask, where are you on the arousal scale? And then there's this other
axis, this other question, which is what we call valence. Now valence
is a value. Do you feel good or bad? I would say I feel pretty good
right now. On a scale of one to 10, I'm like, I dunno, I feel like a
seven. Got good night's sleep last night, had a good walk with
Costello this morning, I'm fed, I'm hydrated. I feel good, So I'm like
a seven. So I'm alert and I feel pretty good. And then there's a third
thing, which is how much we are interocepting and how much we are
exterocepting. So how much our attention is focused internally on what
we're feeling and how much it's focused externally. And this is always
going to be in a dynamic balance. So for instance, if you're really,
really stressed, oftentimes that puts you in a position to be really
in touch with what's going on in your body. If you start having a lot
of somatic, a lot of bodily sensations, like your heart is beating so
fast that you can't ignore it, then you're really strongly
interoceptive. But also sometimes you're really stressed because
someone's stressing you out or somebody sends you a text message or
makes a comment about a YouTube thing you posted or something, and
you're really triggered by it. That never happens to me. But if it
does happen to you, then you're exterocepting. So these three things,
how alert or sleepy you are, that's one, how good or bad you feel,
that's two, and then whether or not most of your attention is directed
outward, or whether or not it's directed inward. And much of what we
call emotions are made up by those three things. And so let's return
now to development, but tuck that away and just kind of think about
it, alert versus asleep, good versus bad, and focused internally or
focused externally. Because when I looked at all the theories of
emotion that were out there, there were a lot of different components
to them, but they all seem to center back to these same three features
in some way or to some degree or another. And it can be very powerful
to understand and look at your emotions through that lens. So let's
return to the infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=1440"&gt;You Are An Infant: Bonds &amp;amp; Predictions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's the baby in the crib. It's mostly interocepting. As caregivers
bring it what it needs, you hope, milk, diaper changes, et cetera, a
warm blanket if it's cold, pull off the blanket when the baby's
fussing and it's too warm, 'cause babies get too warm also, it starts
to exterocept. Excuse me, I misspoke, I want to be very clear, it
starts to exterocept. The baby starts to look into the outside world
and start making predictions. It starts wondering how much it needs to
cry or predicting, "Well, if I cry like a little bit, then mom comes
over and I get my milk. Or if I cry a lot, mom doesn't come over and
give me milk, so I need to really scream at the top of my head." So
babies are starting to evaluate and do all this, but they're not doing
it consciously. They're doing this strategically in order to relieve
anxiety. And I won't propose that that's what we do into adulthood.
But a lot of what we do in adulthood is when we feel something, we
start exterocepting. Some people are much better at just sitting as a
container and just interocepting and paying attention to what they're
feeling internally. But most people do a little bit of a balance of
both. We don't feel good, so we look for an item or food that might
make us feel better. We're feeling anxious heading into the dentist or
something like that, so we text somebody. We do this almost
reflexively, it's not always conscious. So infants do this, and we
continue to do this. We start to now balance our interoceptive and
exteroceptive focus, looking inward and looking outward. And as we do
that, we're starting to figure out what gets our needs met. Remember,
emotions are really there to form bonds and to make predictions. And
so our needs are going to be met to some degree or not. Sometimes
sadly there is neglect. Sometimes people don't show up for us the way
that we would like. And in general, our responses to that have to do
with whether or not we predict whether or not they would or not. When
we expect something and it doesn't happen, It's a big let down. That
was the discussion about dopamine last episode. So the many theories
of emotion, the triune brain theory, that you have a primitive and
involved brain, something that's a little bit on shaky ground these
days. The idea that Darwin proposed, that there are these universal
expressions of emotions. The work of Helen Fisher on love, that you
have circuits in the brain for lost circuits in the brain, for love
and circuits in the brain for long-term bonds, as well as the work of
Lisa Feldman Barrett, saying that emotions are contextual, that they
have a social component. And I'll be talking more about this, but the
work of Allan Schore, a clinical psychologist and researcher at UCLA,
about right brain, left brain, and its role in emotional development.
All of them have strong elements of this idea of paying attention to
what's going on inward and outward. As a young creature, an infant and
young toddler, you were mainly focused inward, and you started to
understand what was going on outward as a way of predicting what would
bring you relief, what would remove your anxiety. And that's where the
fundamental rules of your experience, your emotional experience were
laid down. And I realized that's a lot of information and it's
somewhat of an academic talk, but there were two tools in there that I
just want to highlight, one is the Mood Meter app. If you're
interested in, it can give you some insight into the different kinds
of nuance within emotions and allow you to actually predict emotional
states, if you want to try that and you might find that interesting.
The other one is this idea that there are three axes two emotion,
three continuum that interact, the level of alertness and calmness,
how good or bad you feel, and whether or not you're mainly focused
inward or outward, because those are going to form a useful tool kit
for the information going forward. So now let's talk about what kind
of baby you were,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=1677"&gt;Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because that actually informs your emotionality now. These are
classic. They're actually famous experiments done by Bowlby and
Ainsworth. Anyone that study psychology or has taken a psychology
class might have learned about this. This is this classic experiment
of what was called the strange situation task in which, and I'm
describing it very coarsely here, I realize. But a mother and child
come into the laboratory. Yes, this is now also been done with
fathers. The baby and the mother or father play together for a bit,
and then the mother leaves. The mother leaves for some period of time
and then comes back. And the research is devoted to understanding the
response of the child when the caretaker, the mother or the father
returns, most all children, not every child, but most children will
cry when their primary caretaker leaves. They don't like that. And
there are good reasons for that. They formed a bond and an attachment.
And we will talk about some of the deeper chemical reasons for those
bonds. However, the experiment is focused on the return of the
caregiver. Because Bowlby and Ainsworth, and many of their scientific
offspring and colleagues identified at least four patterns that babies
display when their caretaker returns, and they group these into group
a, b, c, d, so much so that the kids were referred to as a babies, b
babies, c babies or d babies. You may know which one you were. But the
categories are really interesting. The first babies are the a babies.
So these were kids that would get upset when their caretaker would
leave. But when their caretaker would return, the infant would respond
with happiness, with what looked like delight. They would go to the
caretaker. They seemed happy. If they had been fussy before or sad,
they felt relieved. These are referred to as secure attached kids. So
they have a healthy response to separation, and they have a healthy
response to re-engaging with the caretaker. The b babies as they're
called were less likely to seek comfort from their caregiver when the
caregiver would return. So they would sometimes continue to play with
their toys or if they had an adult in the room while the parent was
gone, they would stay with them. It was sometimes complicated and
nuanced, but these were referred to as avoidant babies. Don't run away
with any conclusions about the language here just yet. It's not clear
that avoidant babies become avoidant adults, but bear with me. The c
babies would respond to the return of the caregiver with acts of
annoyance. They seemed kind of angry. So it wasn't that they ignored
them, they seem kind of angry. And those were referred to as
ambivalent babies, not to be confused with a babies. These are the c
babies, were the ambivalent babies. So the infant's reaction to the
returning caregiver were inconsistent. It seemed like they wanted to
bond with them again but that they seem kind of annoyed. I think we've
all felt this way before with people that we care very much about,
especially people we care very much about. And then the third
category, the d babies, were the disorganized babies, that's what they
call them. They weren't disorganized and that they were messy, the
child avoided interactions with everyone and acted fearful when the
caregiver returned, and their behavior didn't really change whether or
not the caregiver was there or not. And that fourth category was
actually added rather late in the course of this research. I should
mention these experiments have been repeated with a huge variety of
different contexts. There was work done by Mary Main at UC Berkeley
and many others, looking at all sorts of variations on this theme. But
over time, it made it clear that certain babies are able to feel
secure upon re-engaging with their caregiver and others don't, or
they're confused about it. So we probably don't know whether or not
you were an a, b or c, d baby, unless you were in these experiments
and somehow you had that knowledge. But this work, this classic work
opened up a huge set of important questions that relate to what is the
reestablishment of the bond really about. I mean, what's actually
being figured out here is not whether or not there are four categories
of babies, that's interesting, but it presumably is more interesting
to focus on what is it that defines a really good bond, a secure
attachment, or an insecure attachment or an avoidant attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=1960"&gt;“Glue Points” Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (&amp;amp; Written)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the four things are gaze. literally eye contact, and doesn't have
to be direct beaming eye contact with no blinks like people have
accused me of before. It can just be gaze, people look at each other,
you see couples, they look at each other, they don't always stare each
other long periods of time, sometimes they do. Vocalizations, so what
we say and how we say it. Affect or emotion, so the way that we
express it, crying, smiling et cetera, and touch, those four things.
And you probably could add a fifth dimension once language and written
language develops, which is written word, exchange of letters,
exchange of texts, exchange of things of that sort, emails, are
another way in which people can bond. But gaze, vocalization, affect
and touch are really the core of this thing that we call social bonds
and emotionality. Now that's important. We know for instance that
there are brain areas like the fusiform face area which is deep in the
brain that is responsible for the processing of faces. Children's
recognition of their parents' faces and voices is extremely accurate
and strong. Likewise, parents recognition of their child's
vocalizations not just voices, but cries are remarkable. If you've
ever had the experience of being at a party with somebody who has
small children and you're talking to them, and all of a sudden they
hear something but you don't, it's as if they've got wolf hearing, and
all of a sudden, they go running into the other room. And indeed the
kid is like, I don't know, some kid is beating up their kid or their
kid's beating up some other kid, or the kid injure themselves or feels
emotionally injured. This perception of voices. There's very good
evidence to support the fact that we are tuned to the frequencies of
voices and vocalizations of people that we care about. It's not just
true in rodents and in birds and other mammals, it's definitely true
in humans as well. And babies are very tuned in to the sound of their
mother's voice, even, yes, while they're in the womb. There's this
whole world of what's called mother-ease, which is the particular
style of speech that mothers and other caretakers now we know use with
children. So those are the core elements. How you look at somebody and
how they look at you, what you say, what they say, what they seem to
be feeling, and how that makes you feel, smiles, frowns. If you know
someone really well, you can read inflections, like even little subtle
things like, mm, they don't really believe me, or, oh they're really
excited by this, or, oh, now I know what they're thinking. That kind
of processing, some people are better at it than others, but
everyone's better at doing that with people that we recognize and
know. In fact, couples come to know each other exceedingly well, so
much so that it can both benefit and injure their relationship to
constantly be making these perceptions. But there's a range. Some
people are more tuned into this than others. And that probably has
roots in the sorts of attachments that you form early on. So Bowlby
and colleagues develop these a, b, c, d thing. And it has a lot to do
with face processing and gaze and vocalizations and touch, all of
those happen on return with the mother, but they weren't parsing
those, they weren't looking at them individually. So this raises a
really interesting question, which is, what is it when we feel
something? Is it because of something that happened spontaneously in
us, it's a memory, or it's something that we realize, we saw on the
internet or we got news about somebody? Nowadays people get so much
information about the people they know, both the people they like and
dislike by way of viewing online activities. So they're exterocepting,
and then it's impacting your internal state. And it's clear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=2194"&gt;“Emotional Health”: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from most all of the theories of emotional health, that an ability to
recognize when your own internal state is being driven primarily by
external events, as important for being able to emotionally regulate.
People who are constantly being yanked around by the external
happenings in the world, you would say are emotionally labile, they
are not in control of their emotions, even if they're calm all the
time, if that calmness only arrives because they're in a placid
environment and then you put a cracker in that environment and they
freak out, well, then they're not really calm. Their calm in so far as
there isn't something disturbing in the environment. So how much the
outside environment disrupts your internal environment has everything
to do with this balance of interoception and an exteroception. And it
very likely has roots in whether or not you were secure attached or
insecure attached, disorganized or ambivalent as a baby. And of
course, you can't travel back in time and know, but there are some
hints as to what kind of emotionality each of us has by examining two
periods of development, one is adolescence and puberty and the other
is adulthood. So while we can't travel back in time, there is an
exercise that you can do to address at least in this moment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=2270"&gt;An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whether or not you have a bias for exteroception or a bias for
interoception, whether or not you are better at least in this moment,
at paying attention to what's going on internally or externally. And
of course, this will vary with circumstance. I think we all know
people that, maybe it's you, you go to a party and you get there, and
everyone seems to be talking and having a really good time, and you're
wondering whether or not you have any food in your teeth or whether or
not there's something on your face or whether or not your hair is
right or whether or not you said something the wrong way, whether or
not you're turning red. People also experience this a lot with public
speaking. It's not just about learning to clamp your level of stress,
it's also about how much you're exterocepting, how much you're out of
your head, they call it. But how much you're focused on the events
around you versus the events inside you. Actually, it's interesting
when you talk to people who are very effective athletes or they have
very high stress high consequence jobs, they talk about this notion of
getting out of your head. You only have so much attentional resource,
and it can be split between two things, you'll see that in a moment.
They can be anchored to one thing. It can be fully focused on what's
going on internally or it can be fully focused on what's going on
externally. And if you want to be effective in the world, effective
being in quotes, it is useful when in very dynamic environments,
especially social environments, to have a lot of your attention
focused outward as opposed to trying to pay attention to whether or
not you're saying things correctly or the tambour of your own voice,
that is more or less destructive for the ability to engage socially.
So here's the exercise. You can do this. Please don't do this if
you're driving. But let's just try and illustrate or allow you to
experience this interoceptive, exteroceptive balance, and the extent
to which you can move interoception and exteroception deliberately. If
you close your eyes right now and concentrate on the contact of any
portion of your body with say the chair or your car seat, although
please, again, don't do this while you're driving, anywhere that you
are, even if you're just standing up or you're in the kitchen, you're
laying on the couch, and trying to bring as much of your attention to
that point of contact as possible. And then from there, you're going
to move your attention even more deeply into say the sensation of
what's going on in your gut. Are you full? Are you empty? Are you
hungry? Are you not? Is your heart beating, at what rate? What's the
cadence of your breathing? Basically bringing your focus and attention
to everything at the surface of your skin and inward. So I'm going to
do a rare thing on the Huberman Lab Podcast. I'm going to introduce
about five to eight seconds of silence in order to allow you to do
that a little bit. Now this is an exercise that you can continue
afterward if you want to extend how long you do this. But now try and
do something that, for most people actually is a little bit harder,
which is to purely exterocept, put your eyes or your ears, or both on
anything in your immediate space, one thing. And I would restrict that
thing to something small enough that at least in your field of view it
would occupy 20% of your field of view. So it doesn't have to be a
pinpoint unless the pin is right in front of you and you're holding it
real close. I would say, look across the room, pick a panel on the
wall or a leg of a table or something, and try and bring as much of
your attention to that as possible. And again, I'll take about five
seconds of silence to allow you to exterocept. So what you probably
found is that you were able to do that, but that some degree of
interoception is maintained. It's hard to place 100% of your attention
on something externally, unless it's really exciting, really novel. If
you've ever watched a really great movie, presumably you're
exterocepting more than you're interoceptive until something exciting
happens and then you feel something. You're actually tethering your
emotional experience to something external. And now you can also do
this dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=2539"&gt;Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can decide to focus internally and externally. You can decide to
split it 50%, 50% or 70/30. You can develop a heightened ability to do
this. And the power of doing that is actually that when you are in
environments where you feel like you're focused too much internally
and you'd like to be focused more externally, you can actually do that
deliberately. But as you notice, it takes work, it involves taking
your attentional spotlight, and what we call the aperture of your
attention, and narrowing that aperture to either the self or something
externally or splitting the two. And yet there are practices that have
been developed that center on moving interoception and exteroception
from one being more heavily weighted than the other, more focused
outward or more focused inward. And it's dynamic. And the circuits in
the brain that underlie intero and exteroception aren't exactly known,
but they are anchored in the areas of the brain that are involved in
attention, like the frontal eye fields and areas that when you third-
person yourself, when you can see yourself doing something, like if
you put your hand out in your environment and you focus on your hand,
you know that that's your hand as opposed to some random object. There
are areas of the brain that are involved in that, in recognizing
location of self relative to the rest of your body. These exercises
are really what are at the core of these development of emotional
bonds. Because as we mentioned before, these four things, the gaze,
vocalization, touch and affect, those are happening very dynamically.
So if somebody winks at you, you're paying attention to their wink,
but then you also notice how you feel. Then they might say something,
then you might say something, this is very dynamic. So if it seems
overwhelming to try and interocept an exterocept and then shift the
balance, you do that all the time. Your brain and nervous system are
fantastic at doing this. Now, some people have a very hard time
breaking out of a very strongly interoceptive mode. Some people have a
harder time breaking out of their exteroceptive mode. It's very
interesting note the extent to which we have biases in how
interoceptive or exteroceptive we are. Remember those three axes that
we talked about earlier, you have valence, good or bad, you have
alertness, alert or calm, and you have interoceptive or exteroceptive
bias. And it's going to differ across the day, it's going to differ
across the lifetime. It's certainly going to differ according to
whatever it is that you're engaged in. But early in development, you
start off with this interoceptive bias. You are starting to develop
expectations, predictions about how the outside world is going to
work. And you are trying to figure out the reliability of outside
events in people. And where things are reliable, when people are
reliable, we are able to give up more of our interoception. There's
literally trust that our interoceptive needs our internal needs will
be met through bonds and actions of others. This starts to veer toward
the discussion about neglect and trauma. We are going to devote entire
episodes, probably an entire month to trauma and PTSD. But those have
roots in what we're talking about now. And it's important to
internalize and understand what we're talking about now in order to
get the most out of those future conversations. So if all of this
seems like a lot of information and very complicated, I just invite
you to pay attention from time to time how much you happen to be
interocepting or exterocepting, because emotions and the intensity of
those emotions will grow or shrink depending on how much we're
interocepting. If we are feeling extremely sad, and there is an
outside event that made us sad, chances are there's going to be a
balance, but that the extreme grief, the extreme sadness is going to
lead us to mostly interoceptive. Whereas when we're feeling extremely
happy, the same is true. Something great happens in the world, and
we're just going to feel it. Most of our perception, most of our
awareness is going to be on our internal state. So we are always
tethered to the outside world to some degree or another. That was true
when you were an infant, and it was true when you were an adolescent,
and it's true as an adult. So now I want to just pause, just shelve
the discussion about interoception, exteroception for a moment. And I
want to talk about what is arguably the second most, if not, equally
important aspect of your development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=2819"&gt;Puberty: Biology &amp;amp; Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it relates to emotionality and as it relates to this, what I call
trust, but this ability to predict whether or not things in the
outside world are reliable or not reliable in terms of their ability
to help you meet your interoceptive needs. And that period is puberty.
So up until now, we've been talking mainly about psychology, not a lot
of biology, not a lot of mechanism. And now we're going to transition
into talking about mechanism, hormones, receptors, et cetera. Puberty
is a absolute biological event. It has a beginning, and it has a
specific definition, which is the transition into reproductive
maturity. So there are a lot of hormonal changes. Yes, there are also
a lot of brain changes. And most people don't realize it, but the
brain changes occur first. The brain turns on the hormone systems that
allow puberty to occur. Puberty is occurring earlier nowadays than it
did in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=2878"&gt;Bodyfat &amp;amp; Puberty: The Leptin Connection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current numbers that I was able to find is that in females and
girls, the transition is starting around age 10, whereas in boys, it's
about age 12, that's going to differ by way of a number of different
factors. Those are averages. So it depends on where you are in the
world, depends on all sorts of things. One of the primary triggers for
puberty is actually body fat. This is interesting. The peptide
hormone, leptin, some people call it a peptide, some people call it a
hormone, but it meets both definitions depending on how you look at
it, is made by fat. So leptin had a lot of popularity in the '90s,
because it was discovered as being produced by fat, and it was seen in
animal studies that it could promote leanness. It actually
communicates to the brain that there's enough body fat in order to
allow the metabolic factors and processes to occur to liberate more
fat. This is why people have trouble losing that last five pounds.
It's because leptin levels are very low. This was actually the basis
for the whole cheat day, refeed thing, that the idea was if you eat a
lot for one day a week while dieting hard, that you can signal to the
brain that there's enough leptin. I don't know if that's the reason or
whether or not the cheat days just provided some psychological relief,
probably both. But in any case, leptin is made by body fat. And when
there's enough leptin, it signals the brain to trigger puberty. There
was a paper published in the mid '90s in the Journal Science,
excellent journal, showing that leptin could be injected into younger
females that would not have yet gone into puberty. And you could
accelerate the onset of puberty with leptin. So more body fat, the
earlier puberty, that's true. Leptin is also involved in various
growth effects in the body generally. And it's interesting, very obese
children don't necessarily undergo puberty earlier. Sometimes they do,
but they do tend to be larger boned. Their bones actually grow more
quickly, and they tend to have higher bone density because leptin is
also involved in bone density. The whole issue of onset of puberty
also has some really interesting social effects. And I want to really
highlight that most of these effects, also called pheromone effects.
Remember a hormone is a substance secreted from one area of the body,
travels, and impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body. A
pheromone is a chemical that's released by one member of a species
that goes and acts on and impacts other members of that species or
even other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=3034"&gt;Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for instance, rodents are very good at detecting the urine and the
scent markings of large carnivores that want to eat them. So that's a
pheromone interaction. Whether or not they're pheromonal effects in
humans is very debated. I did a post on this on Instagram a little
while ago about some pheromone effects that were reported in humans.
And I had a couple of people come at me saying, "Look, it's never
really been shown in humans that there's a pheromonal vomer," what's
called the vomeronasal organ. There's something called Jacobson's
organ. It's rudimentary. Some people have it, some people don't, very
controversial. So I want to point out that human pheromone effects are
controversial. Although I think there's, in my opinion, there's ample
evidence for them, synchronization of menstrual cycles. Many people
report, then people say there's some studies that show that it's not
true. Then there've been some data showing very impressive pheromonal
effects of female partners being able to detect the odor of their
significant others on t-shirts that were washed several times. So they
can't consciously perceive it, but they say this one smells like them,
this one smells like my partner. And indeed, the match was way above
chance. So there does seem to be weak pheromonal effects at least in
my opinion when I look at the data, but much more needs to be done. So
one of the more interesting pheromone effects that impacts puberty, at
least in animal models is the so-called Vandenbergh effect, which is,
if you take a pre-pubertal female, so a female that has not undergone
sexual maturation, and you introduce a novel male that is not the
father or a brother, not a sibling, she will undergo puberty almost
immediately. So this is really striking. For years, this was thought
not to occur in primate species, but there was a paper published last
year in Current Biology, Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
showing that mandrills, a particular type of primate, they exhibit
this Vandenbergh effect. There are also all sorts of other pheromone
effects. There's the most infamous one is called the Bruce effect,
where the introduction of a novel male to a pregnant female animal
causes spontaneous miscarriage. And that effect seems to be protected
against by the presence of the father. This interpretation of this,
and I want to really highlight that these are animal studies, but the
way this works is that if a pregnant female is in the company of the
male that impregnated her, then her young are protected by his scent
presence or his pheromone presence. But if he's gone and a novel male
shows up, there's a tendency for her to spontaneously miscarry, and
essentially for the fetus to be lost. Now, whether or not this occurs
in humans is still very controversial, but nonetheless, these
pheromone effects exist. And that one is called the Bruce effect,
named after Hilda Bruce, who is the scientist that discovered it. The
one that's relevant to the puberty discussion is the Vandenbergh
effect, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, which is a novel male
showing up, has to be a sexually competent male, so he has to have
already passed through puberty, and his presence triggers activation
of puberty in a female that otherwise would have remained pre-pubertal
for longer. Again, whether or not this happens in humans is unclear.
Well, what can we be sure about when we think about puberty? Puberty
is triggered by a number of different factors. There are changes in
GABA expression in the brain, an inhibitory transmitter. One of the
more interesting molecules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=3277"&gt;Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty &amp;amp; Performance Enhancing Agent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that triggers puberty in all individuals is something called
kisspeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin. Kisspeptin is made by the
brain. And it stimulates large amounts of all different hormone called
GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone to be released. Gonadotropin-
releasing hormone then causes the release of another hormone called
luteinizing hormone or LH, which travels in the bloodstream and
stimulates the ovaries of females to produce estrogen and the testes
of males to produce testosterone. Kisspeptin has other effects as
well. But those are some of the main ones as they relate to puberty.
This is interesting, because at this point, the testes in males start
churning out tons of testosterone in order to trigger the development
of secondary sexual characteristics, body hair and all the others,
deepening of voice, et cetera. And in females, estrogen is doing
various other things, breast development, et cetera. Normally, in an
adult, somebody who has passed puberty, a big increase in gonadotropin
releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone would eventually be shut
down, because the way that the brain works, the hypothalamus and the
pituitary are actually measuring how much hormone is in the blood. And
if testosterone or estrogen or any other hormone goes too high, they
shut down the release of things like luteinizing hormone. It's called
a negative feedback loop. Basically is like a thermostat in the house.
It's more complicated than that, but once levels get too high in the
blood stream, it shuts down. But kisspeptin is able to drive very high
levels of these hormones in an ongoing way so that puberty can
commence and can continue. And incidentally, kisspeptin has now become
yet another of the panoply of hormones and peptides and cocktails that
athletes take in order to try and stimulate natural hormone
production, essentially to create their own performance-enhancing
drugs endogenously. No judgment there, but that's a fact, there's a
lot of kisspeptin used. I truly not suggesting anyone do this, but
people are buying and injecting kisspeptin for the specific reason
that even past puberty can stimulate the large increases in things
like estrogen, large increases in testosterone and things of that
sort. Has a number of psychological effects too, seems to have big
effects on libido, et cetera. All these things of course are subject
to feedback loops, so they don't work indefinitely. And I'm going to
highlight, again, I'm not suggesting anyone do it, but I do like to
pay attention to what's out there. And kisspeptin, because it wasn't
discovered that long ago is one of the things that you don't often
hear about when people talk about performance-enhancing drugs or
therapeutic endocrinology. These things also have therapeutic uses in
the endocrine setting. So for instance, kids that don't undergo
puberty or kids that are hypogonadal or adults that are hypogonadal,
they're not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin
among other things. So that's how puberty happens at the biological
level, gets triggered by leptin and kisspeptin. And then this young
child is now a different creature to to some extent, not just because
they're reproductively competent, of course, but because there's a
shift in a number of the things that underlie these social bonds,
there's a market shift in a number of the things that allow children
and adults to engage in predictive behavior about each other. And the
whole nature of adolescence and puberty is to take a child that was a
generalist and to make them a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=3506"&gt;Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists &amp;amp; Testing Emotional Bonds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is very important as it relates to the conversation about
emotionality. But it's important in terms of aspects of brain function
and in terms of learning and in terms of who each and every one of us
will and has become. In adolescents and in childhood, sure, there are
some genetic biases, hair color, eye color, height, and things like
that. A lot of that's programmed into the genome. There are other
genetic biases too of course, that we inherit. But it's in adolescents
in puberty that we go from essentially being somewhat good at a bunch
of things or somewhat poor at a bunch of things, to be coming very
good at a few things and very poor at a lot of other things. And
that's because of the relationship to puberty and neuroplasticity,
this ability to change the brain in response to experience is starting
to taper off such that by our early 20s, it's harder to achieve. Now,
the transition from generalist to specialist is one aspect of
adolescence and puberty, but the other is the formation of social and
emotional bonds. And most of what consumes the minds and waking hours
of adolescents and children who have gone through puberty and going
through puberty is questions about how they relate to social
structures, who they can rely on, and how they can make reliable
predictions in the world, now that they have more urgency that they
are physically changed. In fact, you could argue that puberty is the
fastest rate of maturation that you'll go through at any point in your
life. It's the largest change that you'll go through at any point in
your life in terms of who you are, because your biology has
fundamentally changed at the level of your brain and your bodily
organs, all your organs from the skin inward. So I want to visit a
little bit of the research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=3625"&gt;Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about some of the core needs that occurred during puberty and
adolescence, not just for parents or for the people that might be in
puberty and adolescence, but also so that people can reflect on which
of the sort of boxes were checked off for them as they approached
emotional maturity. So there's a terrific review article that was
published in the journal Nature, which is, if not the premier, then
certainly among the top three premier journals in the field of science
about the biology of adolescence and puberty, as well as some of the
core needs and demands that have to be met for successful emotional
maturation during that time. We will provide a link to that, but I
just want to highlight a few of the things that they place in the
final table. I don't want to go through all the results right now,
because you could do that on your own if you like. They mainly
highlight a lot of the changes in neurons and neural circuits. For
instance, I'll just highlight one, there's a connection between the
dopamine centers in the brain and an area of the brain that's involved
in emotion and dispersal. Dispersal is very interesting. What you
observe in animals and humans is that around the end of adolescence
and during the transition to puberty, both because of changes in the
brain and changes in hormones there's an intense desire on the part of
the child to get further and further away from primary caregivers, not
permanently, they always return, similar to a child that walks off and
then looks back and sees if everything's safe and then continues on.
During adolescence and puberty, both in animals and in kids, it almost
seems like there's a bias for action, and the action is always in a
direction away from the primary caregiver. Now, as soon as I say that,
I can just imagine in my mind that somebody out there saying, "Well,
no, my kid as soon as they hit puberty, they just want to stay home
with us all the time." That's not typical. It happens, but it's not
typical. Mostly there's a desire to start spending more time with
friends, more time with peers and less time with adults. And I find it
extremely interesting to note that that's not just true in humans,
that's true in other primate species. That's true in rodents. That's
true in almost every other mammalian species. So there's something
about these hormones that don't just allow sexual reproduction. They
don't just change the brain and bodily organs and the shape of us,
they also bias us towards dispersal, getting further and further away
from primary caregivers in particular. So parents of teenagers or
future teenagers, it is not just normal, it is baked in to the biology
of humans to disperse around adolescents and in the teen years. So
again, I just want to highlight a few of these, what were listed as
intervention strategies to promote healthy adolescence and puberty.
It's very interesting because the entire article, I should mention who
wrote this article, apologies. One of them is a friend of mine. So the
first author is Ronald Dahl, not the children's book author, I'm
assuming, no, from the School of Public Health at University of
California, Berkeley and Nicholas Allen, Linda Wilbert and Anna
Balanoff Suliman, forgive me for the pronunciation of the last one. I
know Dr. Wilbert quite well. She's done the work on dispersal, is
quite well known for that work, and it's a very extensive review, but
I think you'll find it accessible. A lot of changes and thickness of
the brain at different stages, et cetera. But I think most people will
be interested in what that translates to in the real world. And what's
interesting is during puberty, there's increased connection,
connectivity as we call it between the prefrontal cortex, which is
involved in motivation and decision-making, being able to suppress
action for making long-term goals possible, as well as dopamine
centers and the amygdala. So there's this really broad integration and
testing. I think this is the key element here, testing of circuits for
emotions and reward as they relate to decisions. And I think that's
useful because when you look at the behavior of adolescents and teens,
they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical
interactions with the world. Oftentimes they're engaging in unsafe
behavior. I would never try and justify that with the underlying
neurology, but the neuroscience points to increased connectivity
between areas of the brain that are related to emotionality and to
threat detection like the amygdala, but also reward. So it's a time of
testing behaviorally how different behaviors lead to success or not.
It's how different behaviors lead to fear states or not. Now, of
course you could say that of any stage of development, but it seems
like puberty is a very, very heightened stage in which testing of
contingencies, good or bad is taking place. And of course it's
operating in a body that's now more capable than the infant. So an
infant can damage themselves through error, but it's harder for them
to damage themselves through deliberate planning. That's why it's
important of course, to lock up all the medications in the house, make
sure infants can't get to them, but it's not likely that the infant is
going to devise an extremely diabolical plan to get into the cabinet
to get a certain substance. Whereas a teenager might. So you can start
to map the neurology onto some of this emotional exploration. I do
realize that this episode is about emotions. Puberty is a time in
which the internal state of the person or the animal is being sampled
and tested against different exteroceptive events, only now they are
able to guide those events with more urgency. It's no longer just
about whether or not the caregiver is bringing you milk or bringing
you food. Now, of course, the parents will all say, "Yeah, but I'm
paying for everything that they're doing. I'm paying for the car and
I'm paying for the food." Ah, true. But the biology doesn't care about
the source, the child or the adolescent is now able, the teen really,
is able to now sample many, many more exteroceptive events through
behavior. So some of these recommendations are interesting. The theory
is that one of the motivations is to learn to mitigate the risk of
famine and malnutrition. As teenagers get older, they start
questioning whether or not their parents are everything they thought
they were, whether or not they're the greatest thing that ever was or
the worst thing that ever was, perhaps. Including whether or not they
will be able to provide them resources. So they test whether or not
they can actually feed themselves, whether or not they can support
themselves. Although rarely not, certainly it happens, but rarely are
they really taking care of themselves. Although some teens are forced
to take care of themselves of course, because parents and other
caretakers aren't available. The recommendations that map to the
biology include, there's been a big push for later start times in
schools to match their shifts in circadian rhythms and the need for
extended sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=4068"&gt;Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something we talked about during the sleep episodes. To insist on
sleep interventions for youth who are at increased risk for mental
health problems. Almost every mental health issue is supported by
getting regular quality sleep of sufficient duration. Sufficient
duration is going to vary from person to person. Leveraging different
kinds of social relationships that reinforce positive behavior. This
is starting to sound like kind of a boiler plate stuff. And yet,
really the goal is during puberty to encourage as many safe forms of
interaction that allow children, teens, really and adolescents, I keep
calling them children, but what I mean are children going through
puberty, that allow them to test this thing of autonomy so that they
can start to make good assessments about their exteroceptive events
that they are selecting and how those make them feel internally. So
they're essentially doing a buffet. The buffet has now broadened to
not just include the events and experiences that their parents and
other caretakers bring them, but they can now expand the buffet into
things that they can provide themselves. And so adolescence and
puberty is really seen as the period of development in which one self-
samples for these two elements that we talked about at the beginning,
which are, how do I form bonds and how do I make predictions about
what will make me feel good at a level of interoception. Some of that
might sound a little transactional, that all we're trying to do is
figure out how we can bond with people so we can get what we need so
we can feel how we need. I think that's true to some extent, of
course, there's a richer, more abstract aspect to relationships too,
which are, in relationships you can access things you couldn't do
before, you can cooperate. There's things like teamwork. You can do
all sorts of things. But in terms of the biology, it's clear that
there's this stage of development where more autonomy, more physical
capability is triggered by these hormone changes in the brain, and
these peptide changes in the brain and body. And that nonetheless
brings us back to the exact same model that we started with in
infancy, of alert or calm, feel good or feel bad, primarily
exterocepting, primarily interocepting. So I keep going back to this,
I'm sort of like a repeating record on that, because the same core
algorithm, the same core function is at play throughout the lifespan.
And that's a useful framework in my opinion, because it allows you to
sort through all the data and information that's out there about,
well, this area, the astria terminalis is active or the basal lateral
amygdala is active or gray matter thickening or this hormone or that
hormone, and return to a kind of kernel of certainly not exhaustive
truth, it doesn't cover all aspects of emotionality, but at least
establishes some groundwork from which you can start to evaluate how
different behaviors might or might not make sense, how certain
emotional responses might or might not make sense, regardless of the
age of the person or the organism. A discussion about emotions would
not be complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=4265"&gt;“Right-Brain Versus Left-Brain People”: Facts Versus Lies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without talking about the right brain, left brain stuff. And this is a
very interesting aspect of sociology, psychology and neuroscience.
There's a theory of emotional development that I find particularly
interesting, which is from Allan Schore at UCLA, that talks about how
most of our testing of bonds and relationships is this seesawing back
and forth between very dopaminergic, so driven by dopamine or
serotonergic, driven by serotonin states. And this starts with infant
and mother or infant and father. I talked a little bit about this in
the previous episode, but just to remind you, or for anyone that
didn't hear about it, that during development, healthy emotional
development clearly begins with an ability for the caretaker and child
to be in calm, peaceful, soothing, touch-oriented, eye gazing type of
behaviors. Those really drive serotonin, the endogenous opioid system,
oxytocin, things are very calming and are centered around pleasure
with the here and now, as well as excited states of what we're going
to do next. There's actually a characteristic sign of the dopaminergic
interaction, where both caretaker and child are wide-eyed, the pupils
dilate. That's a signature of arousal. They get really excited.
Oftentimes the baby will look away if it gets really excited those are
signatures of dopamine release in the body, and in adolescents, these
same things carry forward, where their good bonds are achieved through
hanging around, watching TV, playing video games or texting together
or talking, whatever it is that the soothing local activity happens to
be, as well as adventure and things that are exciting, so it could be
sports, it could be shopping, it could be a summer adventure. It could
be the next big thing. And so this kind of seesawing back and forth
between the different reward systems seems to be the basis from which
healthy emotional bonds are created. And I invite anyone who's
interested in this to look up some of Dr. Schore's work. I think I
misspoke on the last episode. He's not a psychiatrist, he's a clinical
psychologist and psychoanalyst, but has deep routings in neuroscience.
So I think a fascinating aspect. But the way it's framed in his book
and in some of the language around right brain, left brain. And we've
all heard this stuff before, that the right brain is thought to be the
emotional side. This is the characteristic thing that you hear out
there. That the right brain is holistic, that it's emotive, and that
the left brain is logical, sequential and analytic. And that's not
what Schore was proposing. There are some right brain, left brain
differences. But the idea that the right brain is synthetic, holistic
and emotive, and that the left brain is logical, sequential and
analytic is false. There is zero neuroscience evidence for that
whatsoever. We're going to address this in more detail during a month
talking about learning and memory and dementia, but let's talk about
some truths, some differences between the left brain and right brain,
because we can't have a discussion about emotion without doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=4458"&gt;Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left brain, at least for people who are right-handed is
linguistically dominant. Meaning, most of language is centered in the
left side of the brain for right-handed people. If you are a left-
hander and you were forced to become right-handed, chances are this is
still true, because of when language gets laid down in the brain. For
left-handers, people that naturally write with their left hand and
always did, language is still mostly in the left side of the brain,
but it's also found more often in the right side of the brain. So it's
not as lateralized as we say, it's kind of distributed between both.
So right-handers, most of your language is coming from the left side
of your brain. Left-handers, it's probably a little bit more evenly
distributed. And there are some variations, whether or not you're a
hook righty or a hook lefty, there's all sorts of nuance to this, but
that's the general aspect. So language tends to be centered in the
left side of the brain. And that includes lexicon, grammar, syntax,
all of it, except for one. And we'll talk about one aspect of language
that seems to be more right brain. That's very interesting. There does
seem to be some arithmetic advantage. So ability in math in the left
side of the brain. And I'm going to talk about how all this was
discovered in a minute. And the right brain, however, is
linguistically primitive. Most people don't realize this because the
right brain is always described as the emotive side, it's super
emotional and holistic, but it's actually linguistically primitive.
And there's a way that that's been teased out through experiment. It's
very good at manipulating spatial things and visual spatial tasks.
It's primarily handling that stuff, but it sort of non-language except
one aspect. And there isn't a ton of evidence for this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=4575"&gt;How To Recognize “Right Brain Activity” In Speech: Prosody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but the evidence is strong, which is prosody. Prosody is the LILting
and falling of language. So a good example would be Italian. I don't
speak Italian. I only know a little bit of Italian, but the most of
the Italian I know is when my Italian colleagues have said to me,
[speaks in foreign language], which means like what are you trying to
say, what are you saying? I think I'm getting that right. Basically
they're saying I don't speak Italian, which is true. Or because one of
them knows I loves Costello very much, they always say [speaks in
foreign language], which means big, lazy guy, which accurately
captures Costello. So even those few examples, [speaks in foreign
language], there's a lot of LILt and fall in Italian, other languages,
not so much. And it varies by language. One of the reasons I find
Italian so beautiful, not the Italian I speak, but the Italian that
other people speak so beautiful to listen to that that prosody and the
shifts in intonation are really quite remarkable. It's almost like a
singing song listening to them speak. And I used to like to go to
scientific meetings. And I always hang out with the Italians, 'cause I
had some good friends in Italian labs, but also 'cause they always
knew where the best food was, their standards for food are incredible.
They would rather starve than eat terrible pasta, and the pasta they
do find and that they're willing to eat is always fantastic. But in
addition to that, they always brought a guitar. They were a lot more
fun than a lot of my other colleagues to hang out with at meetings. So
in any event, the right brain is doing things that are more about
manipulating spatial information. And I'll talk about this more in a
future episode. This was discovered in split-brain patients, the
people that lack connection between the two sides of the brain, this
had to be teased out through very complicated experiments. People like
Roger Sperry who won a Nobel Prize for this, who was at Caltech, Mike
Gazzaniga and others figured out these lateralized differences. but
let's just try and demolish the myth that the right side is synthetic
and holistic and emotive, and that the left side is logical,
sequential, and analytic, that you're a left brain person or a right
brain person. Nothing could be further from the truth. There's no
scientific evidence to support that. And there's a few lesion studies
that can tease out effects that make you think that's what's
happening, but the really careful work points in a totally different
direction. We can't have a complete conversation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=4712"&gt;Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about emotions and bonds and social connection without talking about
oxytocin. Oxytocin has come to such prominence in the last decade or
so, and seems to be everywhere. Anytime you hear a discussion about
neuroscience in the brain or hormones in the brain, oxytocin is
released in response to lactation in females, it is released in
response to sexual interactions. It is released in response to non-
sexual touch. It's released in males and females, and indeed it's
involved in pair bonding and the establishment of social bonds in
general. How it does that seems to be by matching internal state. It
seems to both increase synchrony of internal state somehow, maybe it
sets a level of calmness or alertness. That seems like a reasonable
hypothesis, as well as raising people's awareness for the emotional
state of their partner. And again, this brings us back to this
alertness calmness axis and this interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. In
order to form good bonds, we can't just be thinking about how we feel,
we also need to be paying attention to how others feel, and we're
evaluating a match. We're trying to see whether or not there seems to
be some sort of synchrony between states. And oxytocin, both seems to
increase that synchrony and increase awareness for the emotional state
of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=4809"&gt;Mirror Neurons: Are Not For “Empathy”, Maybe For Predicting Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know many of you are probably screaming mirror neurons, mirror
neurons. Mirror, neurons, as some of you may know, and some of you
perhaps may not, are neurons that were discovered in animals and
humans for their ability to respond when people engage in certain
physical actions like lifting of a pen, but the same neurons would
respond when somebody watched someone else lift a pen. So they were
really mirrors of, were representing mirrors of behavior, both in self
and in others. Mirror neurons are very controversial. There are many
neuroscientists who I respect a lot, who don't think they exist,
because they look at the data, and the data, at least in their mind
were over interpreted in the realm of empathy and in assigning value
to the emotional states of others. And when I look at the literature,
my opinion is that indeed there are neurons in the brain that clearly
represent the actions of others, but it's not clear that they're wired
into the emotion and empathy system in any direct way. And I think the
growing consensus is that mirror neurons, while the name is terrific
and it's so catchy, and encompasses so much of what you would love for
it to encompass, but that the data don't really support that. But this
is controversial, and I'm perfectly happy to get experts on here that
could debate it better than I could. There are however neurons in the
brain that were discovered by my colleague, Keren Haroush at Stanford
when she was working in Noam Ziv's Lab, that clearly point to the fact
that primate species are making assumptions and are trying to predict
the behavior of other members of their species. It's an experiment, I
don't have time to go into in real detail, we should probably just get
Keren on here. For those of you that are familiar with the prisoner's
dilemma, which is really a model of cooperation, you can either
cooperate or one member of a given interaction can cooperate and the
other one won't, where you can both not cooperate. There are ways in
which you can solve this, so-called prisoner's dilemma, by looking at
previous behavior and making predictions about the likely next
behavior that the other individual will engage in. And there do seem
to be neurons that are doing these sorts of predictions or
computations. Again, I'll go into this in more detail in the future.
So rather than thinking about mirror neurons, like neurons for
empathy, I think it's more correct to think about neurons that are
trying to predict the behavior of others. And that's, as we said, one
of the core features of emotions, which are to establish bonds, and
through those bonds, to be able to predict behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=4980"&gt;Promoting Trust &amp;amp; Monogamy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So oxytocin is one component of this ability to predict others'
behavior and to guide our own behavior. So here's some experiments
that involve the administration of intranasal oxytocin. Now I think
you need a prescription, although in some places you don't. There are
people who are taking intranasal oxytocin in order to try and increase
the depth of bonding. And I don't recommend you do that. I've never
tried that. Whatever oxytocin I've released, I've made without an
intranasal exogenous application. But what's been reported is
increased positive communication among couples. So people have taken
intranasal oxytocin in studies. So that study, for those of you like,
was published in Biological Psychiatry, which my psychiatry colleagues
tell me is a fine journal. And the title is intranasal oxytocin
increases positive communication and reduces the stress hormone
cortisol levels during couple conflict, they have them fight, or they
have them fight with and without oxytocin. So interesting. Very much
in line with the idea that oxytocin is the "trust hormone." That's
sort of in keeping with that. That was a 2009 paper. There's other
evidence, for instance, that men report a greater sense of connection
and intimacy with their partners during sex after taking intranasal
oxytocin. There are studies in autistic children. Giving them
intranasal oxytocin as a way to try and help them establish better
social connection and "empathy" or theory of mind. I've talked about
theory of mind before, were understanding of what other children and
adults are experiencing. Oxytocin does seem to create these general
effects, and how nuanced they are in one situation or another, I don't
know. I'm aware and I was told, and I'm definitely not recommending
this, that there's a marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray. Now I
have no idea. Maybe someone can put in the comments why you'd want to
combine oxytocin and ketamine. I can't imagine why. Ketamine is a
dissociative anesthetic that's used for the treatment of PTSD. It used
to be used as a recreational drug. It's very similar to PCP, seems
quite dangerous in fact. I don't know why those two things would be
combined, why one would want to combine them. But there are products
out there that seem to combine those two things. And I'm not certain
why one would do that, but it's interesting to note that it's
happening. A particularly interesting study about oxytocin is that,
that was published in the journal, Neuroscience, which is a good
journal, that oxytocin modulates social distance between males and
females. So that's interesting. What they did is they gave oxytocin to
people that were in monogamous relationships, and then they evaluated
the extent to which the, in this case, the males in those
relationships would pay attention to visual attention to attractive
other potential partners. And it seemed like that the general takeaway
from this study is that oxytocin administration seemed to promote
monogamous behavior. So behavior that wasn't in line with monogamy of
the relationship that they were in as opposed to a foraging for
potentially new mates. Now of course, these are somewhat artificial
experiments or very artificial experiments, depending on how you
interpret them. But the general theme is that oxytocin is promoting
monogamy, it's promoting pair bonding, it's promoting a understanding
of the internal state of others, which requires enhanced exteroception
for those particular others. So not just generally having them look
everywhere and see what's going on in the world, but particularly
paying attention to the emotional states of others. I'm sure several
of you will be asking,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=5220"&gt;Ways To Increase Oxytocin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, what can I do to increase oxytocin," if that's your goal.
There's some evidence. And I invite you again to go to examine.com or
another such site like PubMed if you want to forage PubMed, that
vitamin D is required for proper production, and in some cases can
increase levels of oxytocin when supplemented, which is interesting.
And that believe it or not, melatonin, or old friend melatonin, which
I have pushed back against as a supplement for sleep, because of what
I view as untoward side effects of melatonin in most cases, but it
seems like melatonin in some cases can prime the system for slightly
increased oxytocin release. There's even one report, although it
didn't look that strong to me that low doses of caffeine could
increase oxytocin release. But that to me falls under the category of
what was once described as a drug when injected into a person or
animal is always effective at producing a scientific paper. Meaning
that you can get a result, but the result isn't always so robust. So
you always want to read past the titles and the abstracts and get into
the meat of the paper. And when I did that, the effects were pretty
negligible with caffeine on oxytocin. But it's interesting that
vitamin D and melatonin may have some positive effects on oxytocin
release. But like I said, many people are just taking oxytocin
directly through these intranasal sprays. I'm pretty sure it's
prescription in most places, but check. And again, I'm not
recommending anybody do that. I've never tried it. I don't know that I
will. I think I'm going to stick with the oxytocin that I've got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=5314"&gt;Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other molecule that we make that's extremely important for social
bonds and emotionality is one that we're going to talk about more in
the month on hormones, that's vasopressin. Vasopressin suppresses
urination. It's made by the body, but it was developed as a treatment
for something called diabetes insipidus, where people urinate
excessively, and they actually risk dehydration and they can lose a
lot of electrolytes, et cetera. So it causes water retention. Alcohol
consumption inhibits vasopressin. So large amounts of alcohol, many
people excrete, a lot of fluid and so forth. Vasopressin has effects
on the brain directly. It actually creates feelings of giddy love. It
also increases memory in very potent ways. There's a whole biohacking
community that has been dabbling with vasopressin for some time. I
have never tried it. I certainly don't recommend it. It is
prescription. It is a pretty serious compound to start messing with,
because it has so many different effects in the body. It's interesting
because it creates the sense of giddy love. It's also used somewhat as
an aphrodisiac, so it's similar to oxytocin. It also has very
interesting effects on monogamous or non-monogamous behavior. This,
again, we will revisit in the future. But there's a beautiful set of
experiments that have been done in a little rodent species called a
prairie vole. It turns out there are two different populations of
prairie voles, some are monogamous, they always meet with the same
other prairie vole, and some are very robustly non-monogamous, they
mate with as many other prairie voles as they can. And turns out that
levels of vasopressin and/or vasopressin receptor dictate whether or
not they're monogamous or not. And there's actually some interesting
evidence in humans. When people report their behavior, assuming
they're reporting accurately, that vasopressin and vasopressin levels
can relate to monogamy or non-monogamy in humans as well. We're going
to talk about this in the month on hormones. If we're talking about
the neuroscience of emotions, we have to talk about the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=5443"&gt;Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I described what the vagus nerve is in a previous episode, that it's
these connections between the body and the viscera, including the gut,
the heart, the lungs and the immune system and the brain, and that the
brain is also controlling these organs. So it's a two-way street.
There's this big myth out there that I mentioned before, that
stimulating the vagus in various ways leads to calmness. That it's
always going to calm you down. And that is false. I just want to
repeat that is completely false. In fact, it was just paper, yet
another paper published the other day, which is fantastic, which is
from David McCormick Lab up at the University of Oregon. It's
published in Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, I'm just
reading the title, vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread
cortical, the neocortex and behavioral activation. I've read the
paper, it's fantastic. It illustrates yet again, stimulation of the
vagus increases dopamine release, increases activation of the brain
alertness. It is a stimulant of alertness, it is not calming people
down. Now this is interesting in light of emotionality because of work
that's been done by many groups, but in particular, I'm going to focus
on the work of a colleague of mine, Karl Deisseroth at Stanford, who's
a psychiatrist, but has also developed a lot of tools to adjust the
activity of neurons in real time using light and electrical
stimulation and so forth. I'll refer you to an article in the New
Yorker that was published about this a few years ago I'm going to read
a brief excerpt. I'll put the link in the caption as well. He's
talking to an extremely suicidal depressed patient who has a small
device implanted that allows her to adjust her vagus nerve activity.
Now vagus stimulation was originally developed for the treatment of
epilepsy. It's now being used for various other purposes. Vagus
stimulation can even increase plasticity, it seems. So again,
increasing activity of the vagus increases alertness, and it's just
incredible to see what happens in real time to emotionality when the
vagus is stimulated, again, not calming, but activating alertness.
They're in his office and they're talking, and he asks her how she's
doing, and she describes how she's been doing previously as "going
pancake," which for her just means totally laid out flat, not much
going on. She talks about how she doesn't want to pursue a job. She's
really depressed. And he says in typical good psychiatrist fashion,
"Well, that's a lot to think about," that's actually the quote. And
they talk about her blood pressure, et cetera. And then she says,
mood's been down, just spiraling down, talks about insomnia, bad
dreams, low appetite. So this is severe depression. This is what we
call major depression. And then she requests, "Can we please go up to
1.5 on vagus stimulation?" She'd been receiving 1.2 milli amps of
stimulation every five minutes to 30 seconds but was no longer able to
feel the effects. So he says, "Okay, I think we can go up a little,
you're tolerating things well." They start the stimulation and, "In
the course of the next few minutes," her name was Sally, "underwent a
remarkable change, her frown disappeared. She became cheerful,
describing the pleasure she'd had during the Christmas holiday and
recounting how she'd recently watched some YouTube videos of
Deisseroth. She was still smiling and talking when the session ended,
and they walked out to the reception area." So this is just by
stimulating and activating the vagus. Now why am I bringing this up?
Well, for several reasons, one is the vagus is fascinating in terms of
the brain body connection, two, I'd like to, trying to dispel the myth
that vagus stimulation is all about being calm, it's really about
being alert. I don't know how that originally got going backwards, but
it's about being alert. And once again, level of alertness or level of
calmness is impacting emotion, that this axis of alertness and
calmness is one primary axis in emotion. It's not the only one,
because there's also this valence component of good or bad. Those two
aren't the only ones, because there's also this component of
interoceptive, exteroceptive that we talked about earlier. And there
will be others too. Again, it's not exhaustive. But I find it
fascinating, and it really brings us back to where we started, which
is what are the core elements of emotion, and what can you do about
them? And before we close up today, I just want to make sure that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=5718"&gt;A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range &amp;amp; Depth of Emotional Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even though I've mentioned some tools, I talked about the Mood Meter
app, I talked about oxytocin and some of the things that impact
oxytocin, I talked about some of the ways that you can conceptualize
emotions. This business of how you conceptualize emotions is really
the most powerful tool you can ever have in terms of understanding and
regulating your emotional state. If you're willing to try and wrap
your head around it, I realize it's not the simplest thing to do. But
rather than think of emotions as just these labels, happy, sad, or
depressed, thinking about emotions, excuse me, as elements of the
brain and body that encompass levels of alertness that include a
dynamic with the outside world and your perception of your internal
state. And starting to really think about emotions in a structured way
cannot only allow you to understand some of the pathology of when you
might feel depressed or anxious or others are depressed and anxious,
but also to develop a richer emotional experience to anything. Now of
course, I don't expect that as you're out there interacting with
friends and you're watching TV and experiencing life, that you should
be parsing every bit of your experience in some sort of reductionist
and mechanistic way. That's not the goal here. But for those of you
that are practitioners, teachers of any kind, for those of you that
are kids, for those of you that are trying to understand what your
emotional life and your consciousness, dare I say the word, really
consists of, I do believe that these are fundamental elements that are
well-supported by the science across a variety of researchers doing
things from a variety of different perspectives and some of whom agree
with one another and some of whom don't. So I offer it to you as a
source of knowledge from which you can start to think about your
emotional life differently, I hope, as well as others in a way that
builds more richness into that experience, not that detracts from it.
One last point as it relates to that, many of you have asked me about
psychedelic therapies that are now emerging, things like psilocybin
and MDMA, we are of course going to dive into that topic deeply. We
have an expert guest coming on to discuss that topic. Those compounds
clearly affect the aspects of emotionality that we were talking about
today, calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad, interoceptive,
exteroceptive positioning. And so rather than just do a kind of
cursory exploration of those compounds and what the therapeutic and
scientific community is thinking about them and how they function, I
think it's more important to embed that framework in our thinking so
that when we address psychedelics and we address other sorts of
therapies, cognitive behavioral therapy, different types of emotive
therapies that relate to individuals and couples et cetera, that we
are able to think about them with some sort of structure and rigor
rather than just talk about them as a bunch of chemicals that produce
these amazing experiences that people need to tell you about. Because
if there's one truth, it seems that psychedelic seem to promote
activity of storytelling about psychedelic experience. But that itself
is not really what the therapeutic community and the academic
communities are interested in, they're interested in trying to
understand the universal truths, the universal biological shifts and
psychological shifts that occur in the clinical use of those
compounds. And so we're going to hold off for now, but we will get to
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&amp;amp;t=5934"&gt;Roundup, Various Forms of Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, we've covered an enormous amount of material today. It's
really the equivalent of two if not three university lectures in one
podcast episode. I want to thank those of you that have supported the
podcast and point to ways in which all of you can support the podcast.
Many of these are cost-free. The first is to please subscribe on
YouTube and as well to hit the notifications button so that when we
release new videos, which typically is every Monday for the full
length episodes, but we also know how short clips, that you'll be
notified. As well if you could subscribe on Apple and Spotify, and
leave us a review on Apple. You have the opportunity to leave us a
five-star review if you think we deserve a five-star review. Please
tell your friends and family and co-workers about the podcast if you
think the material would be of interest and informative for them, and
if you want to send them links, that's terrific too. We also have a
Patreon account. It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman. And there you can
support us at any level that you like. In addition, if you could check
out our sponsors, we always provide links to those sponsors in the
captions. That's the best way to support the podcast. And several of
you have asked about supplements. I talk about supplements in various
episodes. We've partnered with Thorne because we think Thorne has the
very highest levels of stringency in terms of the purity of the
contents and the amounts of the contents. They really put in the
bottle what's listed on the bottle, which is not true for a lot of
supplement companies. If you want to see the supplements that I take,
as well as get a discount on those or any of the other supplements
that Thorne makes, you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman, and you can
get 20% off any of those supplements or any of the other supplements
that Thorne makes. So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E dotcom slash the
letter U slash Huberman to get 20% off any supplements that Thorne
makes. And last but certainly not least, I want to thank you for your
time and attention. And thank you for your interest in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles
at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring you
zero cost to consumer information about science and science related
tools, along those lines I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's
podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012 and so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of the
podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens is because I
found it rather dizzying to know which vitamins and minerals to take
and Athletic Greens covers all my bases for vitamins and minerals. It
also includes probiotics and there are now a lot of data supporting
the fact that probiotics are important for the gut brain access, for
immunity for metabolic health, endocrine health, many, many things. So
I take Athletic Greens once, sometimes twice a day I mix it with water
and a little bit of lemon juice and to me it tastes delicious. If
you'd like to try Athletic Greens you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that they'll also give you a
year supply of vitamin D3 K2. There are a lot of data now showing that
vitamin D3 is important for immune function and a number of other
important biological processes. In addition, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman you'll get five free travel packs, travel
packs make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens when you're in the car,
on the plane or generally on the road. So that's Athletic Greens.com
to get Athletic Greens. The year supply of vitamin D3 and K2 and the
five free travel packs. Our second sponsor of today's podcast is
Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.
I've been meditating on and off since I was 16 years old. I'm 45 now.
So that's about 30 years of on and off meditation and I confess most
of that time it was off, meaning I find it really hard to stick to a
meditation practice. A few years ago I discovered Headspace while
flying on JetBlue flights 'cause at that time they were offering
Headspace as something you could watch instead of TV or movies. And it
made me feel great. I'd find that I arrived where I was going, more
rested, more relaxed and I got the Headspace app and I started using
it daily and I've continued to use it daily. Headspace has a large
number of meditations all supported by science. There's also now just
a tremendous amount of science supporting a meditation practice for
all sorts of things like improved sleep, reduced impulsivity, improved
cognition. There are just a myriad of positive effects of meditation.
The hardest thing is doing it and Headspace makes that easy. If you
wanna try the Headspace app and all the meditations they have, you can
go to headspace.com/special offer, and you'll get one month completely
free of all the meditations they have that's headspace.com/special
offer to get one month free of Headspace. The third sponsor of today's
podcast is magic spoon. Magic spoon is a low carb, grain-free keto
friendly cereal. As I've mentioned a few times before on this podcast
the way I eat throughout the day has everything to do with when I
wanna be alert and when I wanna be sleepy. So in the first part of the
day I fast because that enhances alertness. Then I eat keto. So my
lunch and my afternoon meals are ketogenic and then in the evening I
eat starches and vegetables because those aid the transition to sleep.
So for me, magic spoon as a keto cereal is a great snack. It's really
tasty. I don't actually mix mine with milk. I just eat it directly.
They have a bunch of different flavors. I like the frosted flavor also
because it tastes like donuts. And I have a pastry affliction and I
love pastries. So magic spoon allows me to remain on keto during the
day it's healthy. It tastes great. I really enjoy it. So if you wanna
try magic spoon you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman for a variety
pack of different flavors. And if you put Huberman at checkout you'll
get 5 dollars off the variety pack. That's magicspoon.com/huberman to
try a variety pack of different flavors of magic spoon keto grain-free
low carb cereal put "Huberman" at checkout you get 5 dollars off. A
quick note before we begin today's discussion about the neuroscience
of motivation. I'm pleased to announce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=262"&gt;Announcement: Spanish Subtitles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that we have now captioned episodes one and two in Spanish and soon,
all the episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast will be captioned on
YouTube in Spanish. We've used some of the revenue from the podcast to
hire expert captioners. So it should be accurate. You might catch a
mistake here or there a dialect difference from time to time but by
our read and by our experts reads, it's all accurate. So we're very
pleased that people who speak Spanish and digest information best in
Spanish can now digest the information here on the podcast. Thanks to
everyone for supporting the podcast which allows us to broaden our
reach in these ways and we do hope to expand to other languages in the
very near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=306"&gt;Emotions, Addiction &amp;amp; Mindset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, we're talking all about the neuroscience of emotions and
today we're going to talk about an extremely important topic that
central to our daily life and that's motivation. We're going to talk
about pleasure and reward. What underlies our sense of pleasure or
reward. We're going to talk about addictions. You can't have a
discussion about pleasure and reward without having a discussion about
addictions and the addictive properties of certain substances as well
as how to break free of addiction. As well we're going to talk about
the neurochemistry of drive and mindset. So all these themes are woven
together in the context of emotions. Each one of them of course could
also be its own entire month of the podcast and in fact, we are going
to have an entire month devoted to addiction and I have a very special
guest that's going to be joining us to talk about the science and
clinical practices that we know are important for understanding and
treating addiction. But for now, let's just talk about the
neuroscience of motivation and reward of pleasure and pain because
those are central to what we think of as emotions whether or not we
feel good, whether or not we feel we're on track in life whether or
not we feel we're falling behind. So motivation is fundamental to our
daily life. It's what allows us to get out of bed in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=382"&gt;Motivation &amp;amp; Movement: The Dopamine Connection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's what allows us to pursue long-term goals or short-term goals,
motivation and the chemistry of motivation is tightly wound in with
the neurochemistry of movement. In fact, the same single molecule
,dopamine is responsible for our sense of motivation and for movement,
even though nerves controlling muscles. So again, these are nerves in
the spinal cord or brain that move our limbs, the effector chemical
they're the one that actually causes the muscles to twitch to
contract, is a CDOT Colleen in the brain. Acetylcholine is responsible
for focus. However, whether or not we move, whether or not we want to
move whether or not we have the desire to overcome barriers of they
could be social barriers or financial barriers or time constraints.
That depends on this molecule. We call dopamine, it's a fascinating
molecule and it lies at the center of so many great things in life and
it lies at the center of so many terrible aspects of life namely
addiction and certain forms of mental disease. So if ever there was a
double-edged blade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=449"&gt;A Double-Edged Dopamine Blade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the world of neuroscience it's dopamine. So let's talk about what
dopamine is and as always we are going to talk about actionable tools
today. We're definitely gonna talk about some things related to
supplementation. Although you might be surprised to learn that it's
not all just about increasing dopamine and in particular, in some
cases that's the wrong thing to do. Sometimes it's appropriate
sometimes it's not. More so we're going to talk about tools related to
what's called dopamine scheduling, how the way that you're leading
your life and the way that you're conceptualizing your goals can
actually predict whether or not you're going to continue to pursue
those goals. And therefore whether or not you will succeed in
achieving those goals As well as whether or not you will quit. There's
a fundamental relationship between dopamine released in your brain and
your desire to exert effort. And you can actually control the schedule
of dopamine release but it requires the appropriate knowledge. This is
one of those cases where understanding the way the dopamine system
works will allow you to leverage it to your benefit. And if you don't
understand the way that dopamine works there's a good chance that it's
going to pull you out into the current of life. Meaning the rest of
the world is going to control your dopamine schedules. So I'm excited
to tell you about today's information. You're gonna learn some basic
science. You're gonna learn a lot of tools and these tools I believe
are applicable whether or not you're five years old eight years old,
80 years older, anything in between. So let's talk about dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=536"&gt;Dopamine Fundamentals: Precursor to Adrenalin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get a few basic facts on the table. Dopamine was discovered in
the late 1950s and it was discovered as the precursor, meaning the
thing from which epinephrin or adrenaline is made. Now that's
fundamentally important because this molecule we call dopamine
nowadays, we think of as the molecule of reward and pleasure, but
actually it is the substrate from which adrenaline is made and in the
brain it's the substrate from which epinephrin is made epinephrin is
the same thing as adrenaline except in the brain we call it
epinephrin. Epinephrin as you may recall from previous podcasts, or if
you haven't no problem epinephrin allows us to get into action. It
stimulates changes in the blood vessels, in the heart in the organs
and tissues of the body that bias us for movement. And if you'd like
to learn more about epinephrin you can check out our episode on
mastering stress. We talk a lot about it there. Dopamine was initially
thought to be just the building block for epinephrin. And it is indeed
the chemical building block from which epinephrin is made. However,
dopamine does a lot of things on its own. It's not always converted to
epinephrin. Dopamine is released from several sites in the brain and
body, but perhaps the most important one for today's discussion about
motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=615"&gt;The Reward Pathway: An Accelerator &amp;amp; A Brake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and reward is something that sometimes just called the reward pathway
for the it's sometimes called the mesolimbic reward pathway but it's
fundamentally important to your desire to engage in action and it's
fundamentally important for people getting addicted to substances or
behaviors. So how does this work? Well, you've got a structure in the
deep part of your brain called the VTA. It stands for ventral
tegmental area. As always you don't have to remember these names, but
if you want to I offer them to you for food further googling,
research, reading, et cetera, the VTA or ventral tegmental area
contains neurons that send what we call axons little wires that spit
out dopamine at a different structure called the nucleus accumbens and
those two structures VTA and nucleus accumbens form really the core
machinery of the reward pathway and the pathway that controls your
motivation for anything you can think of them like an accelerator they
bias you for action. However, within the reward pathway, there's also
a break the break or restriction on that dopamine which controls when
it's released and how much it's released is the prefrontal cortex. The
prefrontal cortex is the neural real estate right behind your
forehead. It's discussed for so many aspects of neuroscience. You hear
about it for decision-making , executive function ,for planning, et
cetera. And indeed it's responsible for a lot of those. It's this
really unique real estate that we were all endowed with as humans,
other animals don't have much of it. We have a lot of it and that
prefrontal cortex acts as a brake on the dopamine system without that
break you would be purely a pleasure seeking animal. You would be
purely pleasure seeking. You would have no basis for regulating your
behavior in terms of trying to get things that make you feel good. And
that brings us to the important feature of motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=730"&gt;Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is that motivation is a two-part process which is about
balancing pleasure and pain. Okay. Most people think about motivation
and reward and dopamine is just trying to achieve pleasure. And indeed
dopamine is released in the brain from the VTA at the* nucleus
accumbens. When we experience things that we like. So here's the way
to conceptualize this and if you can internalize this in your mind it
will really help you as you move through your day trying to understand
why you might be motivated or not motivated for certain things. So
when you're just sitting around, not doing much of anything, maybe you
wake up in bed in the morning. You're thinking about getting up or
not. This reward pathway is releasing dopamine at a rate of about
three or four times per second. It's kind of firing in a low level.
When I say firing me an electrical activity in the neurons. So when
you're just around, you feel okay, not depressed not highly motivated,
not excited maybe three or four times a second. If suddenly you get
excited about something you anticipate something, not receive an award
but you get excited in an anticipatory way. Then the rate of firing
the rate of activity in this reward pathway suddenly increases to like
30 or 40 times and it has the effect of creating a sense of action or
desire to move in the direction of the thing that you're craving. In
fact, it's fair to say that dopamine is responsible for wanting and
for craving, and that's distinctly different from the way that you
hear it talked about normally which is that it's involved in pleasure.
So yes, dopamine is released in response to sex. It's released in
response to food. It's released in response to a lot of things but
it's mostly released in anticipation and craving for a particular
thing. It has the effect of narrowing our focus for the thing that we
crave and that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee. It could
be as important as a big board meeting. It could be a big, final exam.
It could be a, the person that we're excited to meet or see dopamine
doesn't care about what you're craving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=854"&gt;The Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just releases at a particular rate. In fact, if we just take a step
back and we look at the scientific data on how much the dopamine
firing increases in response to different things, you get a pretty
interesting window into how your brain works and why you might be
motivated or not motivated. Let's say you're hungry, or you're looking
forward to a cup of coffee, or you're going to see your partner. Well,
your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate until you start
thinking about the thing that you want or the thing that you're
looking forward to let's say you're craving chocolate or a good meal,
a steak if you like steak or a nice plate of pasta if you like pasta,
when you eat that food the amount of dopamine that's released in this
reward pathway goes up about 50% above baseline. The neurons there go
from firing, three or four times per second to, six or 10 times per
second. It really depends and these aren't exact numbers. But if we
were to measure the amount of dopamine that's released, it goes up
about 50 points, all right. Sex, which is fundamental to our species,
continuation and reproduction. Although it doesn't have to be for
conceiving children. Sex does release dopamine and it increases
dopamine levels about a hundred percent. So basically doubles them.
Nicotine of the sort that's in cigarettes or some people are taking
nicotine in supplemental form increases the amount of dopamine about
150% above baseline. It also does some other things that we're gonna
talk about, but nicotine does that and it's kind of interesting that
nicotine would increase the amount of dopamine in your brain very
quick, within seconds that's 150 times over baseline as opposed to sex
which is a 100 percent above or food which is 50%. Cocaine and
amphetamine increase the amount of dopamine that's released a thousand
fold within about 10 seconds of consuming the drug. However, just
thinking about food,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=975"&gt;Subjective Control of Dopamine Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about sex, about nicotine if you like nicotine or cocaine or
amphetamine can increase the amount of dopamine that's released to the
same degree as actually consuming the drug. Now it depends in some
cases, for instance the cocaine user, the addict that wants cocaine
can't just think about cocaine and increase the amount of that's
released about a thousand fold is actually much lower but it's just
enough to put them on the motivation track for it to crave that
particular thing. Now, there are reasons why you would have brain
circuitry like this. I mean, brain circuitry like this didn't evolve
to get you addicted brain circuitry like this evolved in order to
motivate behaviors toward particular goals, water when you're thirsty
, sex in order to reproduce and we're gonna talk about the
relationship between estrogen and testosterone and the dopamine system
because those hormones actually bias dopamine to be released. These
things and these brain areas in neurons were part of the evolutionary
history that led to the continuation of our species. Things like
cocaine and amphetamine are disastrous for most people because they
really so much dopamine and they create these closed loops where
people then only crave the particular thing, cocaine, amphetamine that
leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release. Most things don't
release that level of dopamine. Now, nowadays there's a ton of
interest in social media and in video games&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1060"&gt;Social Media and Video Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and there have been some measurements of the amount of dopamine
released video games especially video games have a very high update
speed where there's novel territory all the time not novelty is a big
stimulus of dopamine. Those can release dopamine somewhere between
nicotine and cocaine. So very high levels of dopamine release. Social
media is an interesting one because the amount of dopamine that's
released in response to logging onto social media initially could be
quite high but it seems like likely that there's a taper in the amount
of dopamine and yet people still get addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1095"&gt;Addiction &amp;amp; Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why, why is it that we can get addicted to things that fail to get
to elicit the same massive amount of pleasure that they initially did.
Being addicted to something isn't just about the fact that it feels so
good that you wanna do it over and over again and that's because of
this pleasure pain balance that underlies motivation. So let's look a
little bit closer at the pleasure pain balance because there in lies
the tools for you to be able to control motivation toward healthy
things and avoid motivated behaviors towards things that are
destructive for you. There are a lot of reasons why&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1128"&gt;Novelty, Sensation-Seeking &amp;amp; Anticipation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people try novel behaviors whether or not those are drugs or whether
or not those are adventure, thrill-seeking things or they seek out new
partners they take a new class as you'll notice. I'm not placing any
judgment or value on these different behaviors. Although I think it's
fair to point out that for most people addictive drugs like cocaine
and amphetamine are very destructive. Actually we know that about 15
to 20% of people have a genetic bias towards addiction , you sometimes
hear that the first time that you use a drug you can become addicted
to it. That's actually not been shown to be true for most things in
most people, but for some people that actually is true. And we'll talk
a little bit later about why certain people are heavily biased toward
becoming addicts on the first use of a particular drug. It's actually
very interesting, it has everything to do with whether or not they
were formerly addicted to something else but in any case, the way that
addiction works and the way that motivation works generally in the
non-addictive setting is that when you anticipate something a little
bit of dopamine is released, and then when you reach that thing,
you're engaged in that thing the amount of dopamine goes up even
further but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior and you repeatedly
engage with a particular thing let's say you love running or you love
chocolate as you eat a piece of chocolate believe it or not, it tastes
good and then there's a shift away from activation of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1215"&gt;Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure &amp;amp; Pain Always Prevails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are other chemicals that are released that trigger a low
level sense of pain. Now you might not feel it as physical pain but
the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine and one part, the
mirror image of dopamine which is the pain or the craving for yet
another piece of chocolate. And this is a very important and subtle
feature of the dopamine system. That's not often discussed. People
always talk about just as pleasure. You love social media. So it gives
you dopamine. And so you engage in that. You like chocolate, it
releases dopamine. So you do that. But for every bit of dopamine
that's released there's another circuit in the brain that creates you
can think of it as kind of like a downward deflection in pleasure. So
you engage in something you really want and there's an increase in
pleasure. And then without you doing anything there's a mirror image
of that which is a downward deflection in pleasure which we're calling
pain. So for every bit of pleasure there is a mirror image experience
of pain and they overlap in time very closely. So it's sometimes hard
to sense this but try it the next time you eat something really
delicious. You'll take a bite, it tastes delicious and part of the
experience is to want more of that thing. This is true for any
pleasureful experience. Now, the diabolical part about dopamine is
that because it didn't evolve in order to get you to indulge in more
and more and more of something, what happens is that initially you
experience an increase in pleasure and you also experience this
increase in pain shortly after or woven in with the pleasure that
makes you want more of that thing. But with each subsequent time that
you encounter that thing that you pursue, the chocolate that you
pursue the lover each time, the experience of dopamine release and
pleasure is diminished a little bit. And the diabolical thing is that
the pain response is increased a little bit and this is best observed
in the context of drug seeking behavior. The first time someone
decides to take cocaine or amphetamine, they may do it out of boredom.
They may do it out of peer pressure. They may do it to relieve some
internal sense. Maybe they're bored, or they're just excited. Maybe
they're high in novel novelty seeking. There are a lot of reasons why
people might try a drug far too many for us to get into our parks
here. Maybe they don't even wanna do it but someone encourages them.
They will experience a huge dopamine release and they will feel likely
very good. However, the next time they take it it won't feel quite as
good. And it won't feel even as good the third time or the next time,
but the amount of pain the amount of craving that they experience for
the drug will increase over time. So much of our pursuit of pleasure
is simply to reduce the pain of craving. So the next time you
experienced something, you really like I don't wanna take you out of
that experience but it's really important that you notice this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1391"&gt;Desire Scales With Pain: The Yearning Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that if there's something you really enjoy part of that enjoyment is
about the anticipation and wanting of more of that thing and that's
the pain system in action. And so we can distinguish between dopamine
which is really about pleasure and dopamine which is really about
motivation to pursue more in order to relieve or exclude future pain.
Let me repeat that. Dopamine isn't as much about pleasure, as much as
it is about motivation and desire to pursue more in order to reduce
the amount of pain and we are now talking about pain as a
psychological pain and a craving although people that miss a lover
very badly or that really crave a food very badly, or that are
addicted to a drug and can't access, it will experience that as a
physical craving and a mental craving the body and brain are linked in
this way. It's almost, they'll describe it as painful. They yearn for
it. And I think the word yearning is one that's very valuable in this
context, because yearning seems to include a whole body experience
more than just wanting which could just be up in the mind. So your
desire for something is proportional to how pleasureful it is to
indulge in that thing but also how much pain you experience when you
don't have it. And you can now start to let your mind wander into all
sorts of examples of addictions or things that you happen to like,
I'll use the example that I sometimes use on here which is my love of
croissants. Although several of you pointed out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1483"&gt;The Croissant Craving Circuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these are called croissant but then it sounds like I'm trying to speak
French and I always tried to do that when I was a kid and I went to a
bilingual school and it failed then it's gonna fail now. So I'm gonna
call them croissants. They're delicious. I love them a really good one
makes me wanna eat six. It's true. I have pretty good impulse control,
I think but it makes me wanna eat six. I taste it and it tastes so
delicious and unless I really force myself to experience the taste of
it in my mouth and how flaky I'm getting hungry for it right now and
delicious the croissant is mostly the tastes of that croissant makes
me want to eat more croissants. Now, eventually blood sugar goes up
satiety is reached, et cetera. What happens then? What is satisfaction
and satiety about? Well, that's a separate neuromodulator. That's
about the neuromodulator serotonin. It's about oxytocin. It's about a
hormone system that involves something called prolactin. So we're
gonna talk about all of those in the book "the Molecule of More"
wonderful book those were described as the here and now molecules the
ones that allow you to experience your sensations and pleasure in the
present and for which the brain stops projecting into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1545"&gt;“Here and Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss &amp;amp; Raphe Nucleus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now let's talk about craving and these so-called here and now
molecules and how those engage in a kind of push pull balance that
will allow you to not just feel more motivated, but also to enjoy the
things in life that you are pursuing to a much greater degree. We have
neurons in an area of our brain called the raphe R-A-P-H-E The raphe
releases serotonin at different places in the brain. Serotonin is the
molecule of bliss and contentment for what you already have. I've
talked before about exteroception, exteroception is a focus on the
outside world, everything beyond the confines of your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1586"&gt;In Your Skin Or Out In the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also talked about interoception of focus on things that are
happening internally within the confines of your skin. Dopamine and
serotonin can be thought of as related to extra reception. Dopamine
makes us focused on things outside us that are beyond what we call our
personal space where we actually have to move and take action in order
to achieve things and serotonin in general has to do with the things
that are in our immediate here and now, hence the description of these
as the here and now molecules. So it's interesting to point out that
the body and the brain can direct its attention towards things outside
us or inside us or split our attention between those. I talked about
this in a previous podcast but if you didn't see it, no problem. Just
understand that dopamine biases us toward thinking about what we don't
have, whereas serotonin and some of the related molecules like the
endocannabinoids if you picked up on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1645"&gt;Cannabinoids Lethargy &amp;amp; Forgetfulness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the word cannabinoid, yes it's like cannabis because cannabis attaches
to endocannabinoids receptors and the endocannabinoids are receptors
that and chemicals that the cannabinoids that you naturally make that
are involved in things like forgetting. It's not a coincidence that
pot smokers don't have the most terrific memory. You may know a few
that have great memories but chances are, they would have even better
memories if they weren't pot smokers but you make these molecules that
bind to these receptors that make you feel kinda blissed out and
content in the present. Those are receptors that exist in us not for
sake of consuming THC or marijuana, but for sake of binding of our
natural endogenous cannabinoids. So you've got these two systems
they're kind of like a push pull and if you were to say in the book or
wherever you go there you are Jon Kabat-Zinn talks about this
meditation practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1695"&gt;The Almond Meditation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's different than most meditation practices where you eat one
almond and you focus all of your attention on the almond the taste of
the almond, the texture of the almond. That's really a mindfulness
practice that's geared towards trying to take a behavior which is
normally about pursuit, normally feeding as we were going to engage in
feeding because of dopamine we pursue more of a food because of that
pleasure pain relationship I talked about before the focus on the one
almond or becoming very present in any behavior that normally would be
a kind of extra susceptive pursuit behavior and bring it into the here
and now that's a mental trick or a mental task that the mindfulness
community has really embraced in order to try and create increased
pleasure for what you already have. It's really trying to accomplish a
shift from dopamine being released to serotonin in the cannabinoid
system, being involved in that behavior. So if you're interested in
mindfulness which is something I've talked about before in this
podcast and I sort of made some off the cuff jokes about the opposite
of mindfulness being mindlessness. Mindfulness is a vast space that is
a mindful practice that a lot of people have engaged in. And indeed it
can give you deeper appreciation for things that you already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1770"&gt;Drugs That Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has the quality of making people kind of rabidly in pursuit
of things. Look at people who are high on cocaine or amphetamine, and
they are almost entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, the
opioids anything that really hits the serotonin system hard tend to
make people rather lethargic and content to stay exactly where they
are. They don't wanna pursue much at all. Occasionally when people
smoke marijuana or consume THC their appetite goes way up and they
really wanna consume food. That's because of its effects on insulin
and its effects on blood sugar, which is a slightly separate matter.
But since some of you, probably your minds might've gone to those
either experiences or reports of what pot does, that's why it does
that. So you've got these molecules like dopamine that make you
focused on the things you want and the things you crave. And then
you've got the molecules that make you content with what you have. So
the most important thing, perhaps in creating a healthy emotional
landscape is to have a balance between these two neuromodulator
systems people that are always in anticipation and desire and seeking
that's wonderful for pursuing goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1836"&gt;Emotional Balance, Active &amp;amp; Passive Manipulation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's terrible for enjoying life and actually those people are
actually quite difficult to be around. There's a certain, almost
sociopathic element to people who are what they call hyper
dopaminergic. People who are always on the dopaminergic scale to the
point where they are always pursuing goals. In fact, those people are
known to be at least in the psychological spectrum. They can be very
manipulative dopamine and the pursuit of something doesn't necessarily
have to be high energy and intense from the outside. When you observe
it from the outside. In fact, there are people who will manipulate in
order to get what they want. This has been shown who have high levels
of dopamine release in their brain, but they've learned that a kind of
passive manipulation is the best way to maneuver through a particular
environment. I don't wanna focus too much on sociopathy because those
are kind of extreme examples but it just goes to show that people who
identify a goal and realize the series of steps that they need to take
in order to achieve that goal can either do it through ethical means
or non ethical means they can do it through active pursuit, being the
kind of type a person that's always declaring their goals and going
after it, posting it on Instagram telling everybody about it, try and
recruit others. There's that phenotype there's that kind of signature
of dopamine and then there are the people that wanna get what they
want, and they're doing it by always serving other people by always
taking care of everybody else's needs by always trying to accomplish
their goals but through a mode that at least from the outside seems
more passive or more about supporting others. Neither of these are
good or bad. And that's because dopamine is a molecule. It doesn't
care how you reach your goals. It only cares that you reach your goals
because the internal sensation is one again of mild pleasure a little
bit of pain, although more pain over time. If you're not reaching
those goals and it takes you away from the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=1956"&gt;Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine, Prescription Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at about this point in the podcast I'm guessing that some you are
thinking, okay, great. I want more dopamine. I want to be more
motivated. I don't wanna procrastinate as much and I want to be able
to experience life. I want these here and now molecules to be released
as well. Well, there is a way to do that, but you have to understand
the source of procrastination is not one thing. There are basically
two kinds of procrastinators or so says the research. The first kind
are people that actually really enjoy the stress of the impending
deadline. It's the only way they can get into action. These are people
that really like the feeling of something being due in an hour and how
activated and sharp and focused that makes them feel. Those people are
people that are tapping into the epinephrin system, the stress system
and for which the stress really tightens their ability to see it
creates that soda straw view of the world. It creates an action
element in the body that makes them feel like they wanna move. It
really eliminates all the distractions for them. So they're actually
leveraging stress internal stress in order to achieve a state that
they can't seem to otherwise achieve. I won't tell you what to do in
order to overcome all kinds of procrastination but from a logical
perspective, it makes sense therefore, for those kinds of people to
think about other ways that they can get their system into activation,
I've talked about this in previous podcasts but a couple of those
tools might be the what we called super oxygenation breathing which I
admit is not always super oxygenating. So this would be if didn't want
it to consume anything. This could be 25 or 30 cycles of in deep
inhales and exhales. It's likely to create some anxiety and a low
level stress. If you're someone who's prone to panic attacks I
wouldn't recommend this, but it's pretty straight forward. It will
deploy adrenaline into your system. And you will find that your visual
field is focused and you will be able to work and focus better than if
you just kinda waited around for some wave of motivation to wash over
you. Normally you're waiting for that deadline to come into sight and
then that's what the stimulus is. But you can self-direct adrenaline
release without ingesting anything. You can also ingest coffee,
caffeine or Mate or something like that, which is what I prefer very
often to coffee, which has caffeine. Caffeine does release dopamine at
low levels how much it releases dopamine it isn't clear. It seems to
increase firing in these neurons in the nucleus accumbens by about 30%
which is a pretty low level, but it can create agitation so for
caffeine sensitive people, that could be a problem. I've talked before
about things like L tyrosine the precursor to dopamine or Mucuna
Purina. I talked about that in the last episode but if you didn't see
that, just to remind you L tyrosine is present in red meats, it's in
certain nuts and L tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine. You can
supplement L tyrosine. If you like, you will get a big inflection in
dopamine but there is a crash associated with it. However, it will
increase motivation in the short term not suggesting anyone do this. I
wanna be very clear to say what I always say. I'm not a doctor. I
don't prescribe anything. I'm a professor. I profess things. You have
to know whether or not these things are appropriate for your mental
and physical health or not. So you need to consult a doctor. For
instance, people who suffer from schizotypal or schizophrenia or mania
should probably not be taking supplements that increase their dopamine
levels. Now, if you can't increase your level of focus and your level
of alertness and your level of motivation using breathing well then
there might be something else at play. There are other procrastinators
for which they simply are not releasing enough dopamine. They're not
making enough dopamine. And for those people there are a variety of
things that can increase dopamine. I do suggest you talk to a
psychiatrist or doctor I've talked about Mucuna Purina, which is
99.9%. L-DOPA the precursor to dopamine. So there are people that do
much better when they take things that increase their dopamine levels.
There are antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior own which increase
is the other name for it which increased dopamine and epinephrin, it
can increase risk of epileptic attacks if you're epileptic. So again,
you have to talk to your doctor but they will increase dopamine and
motivation and focus. However, if you think back to our earlier
discussion about dopamine, dopamine if it's very high, creates a sense
of pleasure and the desire for more, so you can also become a person
for which enough is never enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=2224"&gt;When Enough Is Never Enough; How Dopamine Undermines Itself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that dopamine really wants is more of the thing that
releases dopamine and so big inflections in dopamine, whether or not
they come from cocaine or whether or not they come from a
supplementation, caffeine exercise study regime will just make you
want more of something and we've all heard before of growth mindset
this incredible discovery of my colleague, Carol Dweck where some of
these positive mindsets that the psychology community has put forth as
really good for pursuit of goals and pursuit of things that require
long bouts of effort. Well, it's wonderful if you can learn to attach
dopamine to that process psychologically, but if you're starting to
augment the amount of dopamine increase the amount of dopamine through
things like supplementation and prescription drugs what's gonna happen
is you're not only gonna need to pursue more and more of the sorts of
things that are associated with the dopamine. So more doing more
studying, more sport more pursuit, higher mountains, more money, more
whatever but we know that over time, the mirror image of that the pain
of lack of accomplishment will also increase. This is the pleasure
pain relationship that we talked about earlier. So in a few moments,
I'm gonna talk about how to think about healthy dopamine schedules but
I just wanna take a step back for a second and talk a little bit about
the flip side of Dolby and what happens after this so-called dopamine
crash what mechanisms are installed in us, because believe it or not,
there are mechanisms that are installed in all of us that really put
the complete and total break on dopamine, why they're there and what
they do because you've experienced these before and there are actually
ways that you can navigate them. These dopamine crashes are these
intentional dopamine suppression mechanisms in order to leverage
healthier dopamine schedules and to feel more motivated. Perhaps one
of the most fundamental mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=2338"&gt;Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction &amp;amp; Refractory Periods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in all humans is the neuro circuitry designed for seeking out mates
and for reproduction and that's because the continuation of any one
species is the primary driver for any species. That's just the
reality. Now I'm removing all context here. So whatever I say, of
course, it's on a backdrop of consensual age appropriate species,
appropriate context, appropriate all of that. This is not about the
sociology of reproduction and sex. This is about the biology, the
biology of sex in males and females doesn't matter if it's XX
chromosome X Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter. The reality
is that dopamine is released on anticipation and consummation of sex
and reproduction. And after orgasm, regardless of chromosomal
background there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine and an increase in
a hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin is associated with milk
let-down in lactating mothers. It's also present in males and in
general prolactin creates a sense of lethargy of stillness and lack of
desire to move and lack of desire to pursue more of whatever released
the dopamine. Prolactin in fact, sets the refractory period on a
male's ability to mate again now this is gonna vary tremendously from
individual to individual. It also can, there are data showing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=2430"&gt;The Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression of Prolactin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that it can vary tremendously from mate pairing to mate pairing the
number one thing that releases dopamine is novelty and it is true that
the refractory period is shortened by the introduction of novel mates.
This was first shown in a kind of classic experiment in of all things
in chickens. This is called the Coolidge effect and the story is the
story goes and I believe it's a true story, it's actually in all the
neuroendocrinology textbooks. So I believe it's true is that president
Calvin Coolidge was visiting a chicken farm. They were is being taken
around and the person who was hosting the visit showed them a rooster
that was Coolidge and his wife were on the visit and said "this
rooster copulates thousands of times per day." And Mrs. Coolidge
apparently kind of elbowed president Coolidge and said, "ah, you hear
that" kind of like pointing out the prowess of this rooster and
Coolidge said," yeah but let me ask you a question, same hen or
different hens." It turns out it was different hens. And the reason is
the introduction of a novel mate increases dopamine levels. And what's
interesting about this is that after copulation prolactin goes through
the roof and prevents further copulation dopamine crashes but the
introduction of some sort of novelty shortens this. Now this is not a
ploy for people to change mates often what this is a story about the
dopamine and prolactin system that also exists in humans. Now, there
are actually things that people in certain communities take in order
to bypass these refractory periods. There's actually drugs that
increase dopamine suppress prolactin and vice versa. There's actually
another way to suppress prolactin. Vitamin B6 is a fairly potent
prolactin inhibitor as a zinc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=2542"&gt;Vitamin B6, Zinc As Mild Prolactin Inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you look out there in the literature and for those either in
the wellness and cost sports performance community a lot of the so-
called quote unquote testosterone boosters are actually combinations
of vitamin B6 and zinc which inhibit prolactin and by way of
inhibiting prolactin increase dopamine. So they do have some
functional effect in that regard. They're not really increasing
testosterone directly they're suppressing prolactin levels. And there
are clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia which leads to massive
decreases in libido, et cetera. And there are prescription drugs to
treat hyperprolactinemia, which of course you should always talk to an
endocrinologist about those sorts of prescription drugs. So it's
interesting that this very basic mechanism of dopamine and prolactin,
this sort of motivation, no more motivation is a system that evolved
for reproduction first, but that actually takes place. And you can see
in elsewhere in the world, for instance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=2605"&gt;Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity and Side Effects of Anti-Dopaminergic Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;schizophrenia disease that has many different types and facets, but
schizophrenia is a case of an often of hyperactivation of the dopamine
system so much so that it can make people feel kind of high, they
hallucinate, I mean, we're talking very very high or dysregulated
dopamine circuits in the brain. One of the treatments for
schizophrenia are drugs that block dopamine receptors. And if you have
the it's unfortunate, there are so many people that are out on the
street these days who have schizophrenia, some of whom are taking
their meds, some of who, whom aren't if you ever see somebody on the
street that's doing what's it's like a lip smacking and writhing it's
actually called tardive dyskinesia. This is a movement disorder that's
created by taking these anti dopaminergic drugs. So you can imagine
these anti-doping synergic drugs while being very effective in
suppressing hallucinations they create these movement problems because
of dopamines importance for the movement circuitry so-called pyramidal
circuitry for the aficionados. In addition, you sometimes see in males
that take these drugs, drugs like haloperidol and the other dopamine
blockers that they actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. So the
development of male breast tissue is because of the elevated levels of
prolactin because they're suppressing their dopamine so much. Now
that's a really extreme case, but maybe perhaps if you see somebody
engaging these very strange kind of face riding and body riding
behaviors that's actually not a consequence of their mental illness.
That's a consequence most often of the drugs that they're taking to
treat the mental illness. Those are side effects of those drugs. Now
prolactin is increased any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=2708"&gt;Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” &amp;amp; Extending the Arc of Dopamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have some really heightened, intense experience. It's not just
released after sex and reproduction. Prolactin is released after some
major event, it's actually responsible thought for some of postpartum
depression for different types of kind of the, the let down the low. I
can distinctly remember that after finals or after publishing a big
paper, I would be very, very happy but then I'd find that, Oh, you
know like what next or things might seem a little bit dimmed or dulled
out for the next day or so, or the following week. The timescales on
these are gonna vary because some people release a lot of dopamine for
a very long time in response to something great and other people have
a quick inflection of dopamine and then they're back to feeling not so
great. It really varies from person to person. In fact, long ago, I
started as I learned about dopamine reward circuitry and the
relationship would be between dopamine and prolactin. I started to
leverage this, believe it or not. After some major event I would take
a couple 100 milligrams of vitamin B6. I think for people who have
diabetic neuropathy you need to be careful with vitamin B6 check with
your doctor. I was told, although I haven't found the literature on
this that it can, in some cases exacerbate peripheral neuropathy, but
for most people it's thought to be reasonably safe but again, always
check with your physician but I would take some B6 to kind of offset
some of that low. And I actually, I don't know if it was subjective or
not but it seemed to have somewhat of a positive effect. I also
started just internalizing the fact that dopamine is so subjective.
There are objective aspects to dopamine and how much is released but
there's also some subjective effects to dopamine. And so one of the
things that you can do in order to generally just be a happier person
especially if you're a person in pursuit of long-term goals of any
kind is the longer that you can extend that positive phase of the
dopamine release. And the more that you can blunt the pain response to
that the better, and you can actually do this cognitively. I used to
joke with my lab that when we'd publish a paper I would get really
excited, but I wouldn't allow myself to get too excited what I wanted
to do instead and what I've still tried to do is try and extend the
arc of that positive experience as long as I possibly can simply by
thinking back like, Oh, that was really cool. I really enjoy doing
that work. I really enjoyed the discovery. I really enjoy doing that
with the people that I was working with at the time, what a pleasure
that was. I can get this very easily from pictures of people, in
things like Costello that I really enjoy trips that I've taken. So you
can extend pleasure without having to engage in the behavior over and
over. That's extending the arc of that dopamine release as well. It
offset some of the pain of not having that experience occur over and
over and over again. Now for the high performers out there you're
probably familiar with this many people who have a big achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=2880"&gt;The Chemistry of “I Won, But Now What?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their first thoughts are will now, what what am I gonna do next? How
am I ever gonna exceed that? And indeed many people who are very high
on this kind of dopamine sensation and novelty seeking scale are prone
to addiction. They're prone to the rabid pursuit of external goals of
external perception to the neglect of these internal mechanisms that
allow them to feel calm and happy. So for people that are very driven,
very motivated adopting a practice of being able to engage in the here
and now the sort of almond type practices we talked about earlier of
learning how to achieve a really good night's sleep on a regular basis
through tools and mechanisms I talked about in previous podcasts gives
us sort of balance to the pleasure seeking for an offsetting of pain
and the pleasure in the here and now. So pleasure is really two
things. It's a joy in pursuit but it's also the joy in what you have.
And there's a beautiful model of emotional development that was
developed by Alan shore professor at UCLA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=2940"&gt;Healthy Emotional Development: Child and Parent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and psychiatrist that talks about some of the basics of good infant
parent attachment where good parenting that leads to healthy adult
relationships and emotion regulation tends to include both sides of
this dopamine serotonin spectrum. We talk about the relationship
between child and parent typically was the mother, but also father
where you can get the child really excited by kind of squealing and
ramping them up or talking about something or ice cream or play. And
the kid gets very excited. That's the dopaminergic system the
anticipation of something that's coming, but as well engaging with
children in a way that's really about everything that you have right
in the here and now, the reading of the book the kids always seem to
ask one more time. One more. They seem to want more of the things that
they enjoy but really engaging with them in a way that increases their
sense of pleasure for what's right there, as well as giving them a lot
of things to be excited about and positive anticipation. Now, having
worked years ago with at-risk kids and also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=3003"&gt;Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with young kids at summer camps and things like that one of the things
that you learn is you never say maybe to a kid about a reward. If you
say, we might have ice cream later you are essentially saying we are
having ice cream. They don't hear the maybe part and it turns out
adults don't either. It's really interesting. There's something called
reward prediction error. I've talked about this before but I haven't
really talked about it deeply in the context of the dopamine system,
dopamine, as I've said, is involved in anticipation of wanting, not of
having it's involved in motivation toward the thing that you want. And
it biases us towards action. Reward prediction, error equals the
actual amount of dopamine that's released in response to something
versus minus the amount that's expected. Okay. So if you tell a kid,
we might have ice cream they hear we're gonna have ice cream and they
expect it. And if you later say, well we're not gonna have ice cream
and I said, maybe that's actually gonna lead to a much bigger crash in
dopamine. It's going to lead to a negative signal, a punishment
signal. It's literally going to feel like pain. So kids, you can
leverage this. If your parents say maybe they're effectively telling
your dopamine system absolutely. Now adults are like this too. If we
think something might happen and it doesn't happen there's a big crash
in our aspect, in our emotionality and that's because that dopamine
system goes from firing about three to four times per second to about
10 or 15 times per second in the possibility that something might
happen possibility is deeply woven into our biology of the dopamine
and motivation system, as a way for us presumably in ancient times to
explore novel territories and get a sense that maybe there's water
there. Maybe there are mates there. Maybe there's better food there
maybe there's resources there. The maybe is important thing that in
language terms maybe means maybe, but in neuro-biological terms maybe
means perhaps there's going to be the surprise of an even bigger
dopamine reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=3122"&gt;Surprise!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the one thing dopamine loves more than anything else is surprise.
When we get something positive, we go to the mailbox we're expecting
some bills and you open it up and you get a letter from somebody you
haven't thought about in a long time. And you adore that person.
That's a huge dopamine release. It actually triggers neuroplasticity.
You probably never forget that because of the way that dopamine Gates'
plasticity. When we get an, a surprise of something that we didn't
want, also it creates plasticity. So the surprise, novelty,
motivation, and reward they're all woven into this package that we
call dopamine. And the cool thing is you can actually regulate this
whole system in a way that will steer you or lean you towards more
positive anticipation of things in life and less disappointment. It's
simply a matter of adjusting what we call the dopamine schedule. Okay.
A couple things before we continue,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=3179"&gt;Are You Suppressing Your Drive and Motivation By Working Too Late?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we're gonna talk about attention deficit in a few minutes. But before
that, I wanna talk about something that I've mentioned before in
previous podcasts, but that you may not be aware of and if you're
aware of you may still be doing, which is severely injuring your
ability to release dopamine it's creating a sense of disappointment in
ways that are most likely hurting you mentally and physically. And
that's the blunting of dopamine by viewing light in the middle of the
night I realized this is not a discussion about sleep and circadian
rhythms, but the data now are so strong showing that viewing bright
light from about 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM too often triggers activation of
this circuit called the habenula So this is eye to It goes from your
retina to a structure called the habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A Then from
the habenula to some of this reward circuitry and it suppresses the
activation of the reward. Circuitry, not just in that moment, but to
things that you normally positively anticipate and pursue. And the
reason I'm bring this up now is because I haven't really gone into
depth on the dopamine system before now, you understand that you have
this very precious reward system. That's kind of a double-edged sword.
It needs to be taken care of and treated well. You wanna use it, but
not overuse it, et cetera but getting bright light exposure in the
middle of the night is reducing your capacity to release dopamine. So
it's not just about the sleep that you're not getting in that time.
It's also that you're not getting the dopamine that would otherwise be
available to you. So you're actually taking, think of light in the
middle of the night as a kind of antagonist is kind of a blocker of
dopamine. Maybe that'll help you. If you're somebody who has to work
in the middle of the night and you wanna bypass this dopamine
suppression please see the episode about jet lag and shift work
because there are a lot of tips there that will allow you to do that
in order to understand how to control the dopamine system how to
leverage it for a better life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=3290"&gt;Disambiguating Pleasure and Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to understand the results of a very important experiment.
This experiment was able to separate pleasure from motivation. It's a
very simple, but like many simple experiments a very elegant
experiment, what they did and this has now been done in animals. and
in humans, they offered rats food. It was a food that they
particularly liked and the animals would lever press for a pellet of
food kind of classic experiment that eat the food and they presumably
liked the food because they were motivated, press the lever and eat
it. Great. They took other rats. They eliminated the dopamine neurons.
You can do this by injection of a neurotoxin that destroys these
neurons. So they actually had no dopamine in their brain. They have no
ability to release dopamine and they gave them a lever that rats would
sit there and they'd hit the lever and they'd eat the food. They're
still enjoyed the food. So you say, well, okay so dopamine is involved
in motivation. It is involved in pleasure. No, it absolutely is. They
could still enjoy the food, but if they moved the rat literally one
body length away from the lever. What they found was the animals that
had dopamine would move over to the lever, press it and eat. And the
ones, the rats that did not have dopamine available to them, wouldn't
even move one body lane, one rat length to the lever in order to press
it and get the food. Dopamine, therefore is not about the ability to
experience pleasure, it is about motivation for pleasure. This has
been repeated in humans in a variety of different scenarios. You can't
really do the lever press thing quite as easily but we know that
people have low levels of dopamine are simply less motivated even
though they can achieve pleasure. And this has serious ramifications
for the fact that now, quote unquote pleasure or ways to induce things
that we believe give us pleasure are everywhere. And they're within
reach. We don't have to forage for our food. There's lot of highly
processed, high sugar high fat foods. There's also foods that are
healthy, that tastes good but they're hopefully they're pretty easy to
get all that different people have different access to things, of
course, but dopamine isn't about the ability to experience pleasure.
It's about how motivated you are to reach those pleasures. And so many
of you are probably thinking, wow I'm not a very motivated person.
Like you talked about the one kind of procrastination earlier. What
about when I just feel kind of met about life now for some of you,
there may be a real clinical depression and you should talk to a
professional. There are very good prescription drugs that can really
help people. There's also great non drug treatments of psychotherapy
and other treatments that are being developed in addition to
psychotherapy in the various kinds of psychoanalysis, et cetera, that
one can use. I think the data really points to the fact that a
combination of pharmacology and talk therapies are generally best. And
there are a huge range of these things. I know many of you are in
these professions. We're not gonna talk about that right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=3480"&gt;Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), &amp;amp; Acetyl L-Carnitine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a compound. That's kind of interesting in the supplement space
that isn't MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA it's not L tyrosine that isn't
promoting massive releases of dopamine or even dopamine alone but a
combination of dopamine and serotonin. And it's an intriguing molecule
it's sold over the counter. Again, you have to check with your
healthcare provider before you would take anything or remove anything.
That's very important, which is, but it's, fenal ethyl fenal Ethel
aiming, or P-E-A pea or beta fenal Ethel aiming releases dopamine at
low levels but also serotonin and low level. So it's kind of a
cocktail of the motivation molecules as well as the quote unquote here
and now molecules. And people's response to this varies widely but
many people report feeling heightened sense of mental acuity
wellbeing, et cetera. It is a bit of a stimulant like anything that
triggers activation of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway but is
an interesting supplement. I actually haven't tried it before. So I
can't report on my own experiences. I will point you however, to
examine.com. It wouldn't be a Huberman Lab Podcast episode. If I
didn't point you to examine.com this incredible free resource where
you can put in any supplement. And it will tell you the quote unquote
human effect matrix it'll point you to the various studies. We always
provide a link to this in the caption. It's an amazing resource. So
you can go there to explore more but I haven't talked about beta Fino,
L Ethel, Amy and before in previous podcasts and I wanted to add it to
the list of things that tap into the dopamine system that are in this.
I guess we call it now the supplementation space. I personally am
fascinated by these supplements and the things that exist out there
that are non-prescription that seem to, at least in some people have
positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=3600"&gt;Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity &amp;amp; Obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, last episode we talked about CDOT L-carnitine, which
there are several papers that report antidepressant effects as well as
positive effects on other things, sperm health, ovarian health, et
cetera. I learned from a colleague that acetyl L-carnitine in Europe
is actually a prescription drug in the US it's sold over the counter.
So I guess, depending on where you're listening to this the
availability might vary. And as always, I put the caveat, you have to
check with your healthcare provider, if it's right for you but I'm
fascinated by the fact that these things exist and that they lie
somewhere between prescription drugs and doing nothing. And that makes
them interesting compounds. And I think that P-E-A beta fennel
ethylamine is yet another one of the, of such compounds. I going to
talk a lot about attention deficit and attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder in a future episode, but I do wanna mention it today in the
context of dopamine and impulsivity. So ADHD or ADD so attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADD our clinical diagnoses. I think a
lot of people nowadays walk around and say I have ADD or you have ADD
and indeed one can create a sort of ADD by attention switching all the
time. I'm a big fan of Cal Newport. He wrote the book" deep work." I
believe he was the one who said context switching is terrible for the
brain. It's like the worst thing for the brain because then the brain
learns to context, switch and real deep work productivity, learning of
all kinds good relationships of all kinds really come from depth of
experience not from breadth of experience within the moment. And so I
think it's important to know that there's clinical ADHD and ADD and
then there's the kind that people are kind of inducing and through
distraction and social media and phones, et cetera. And those can
sometimes lead to clinical ADHD and ADD But I wanna talk about ADHD
and ADD in kids just briefly the drugs that are normally given to
treat those conditions ADHD and ADD are things like Adderall things
that have very amphetamine, light qualities and structures, and you
might ask, why would they do that? Well, it turns out that in kids
these activate that for brain circuitry the break that exists on the
deeper mesolimbic circuitry. So as you recall, there's the VTA and
nucleus accumbens as the kind of accelerators on dopamine. And then
there's the prefrontal cortex which acts as a break and can limit
impulsivity. And those drugs tend to increase the activity of neurons
in that pathway, the prefrontal cortex and it reduces impulsivity. In
fact, there's a experiment described in the book "the molecule of
more," which is really interesting where they looked at impulsivity in
obese children and it turns out they did this experiment in a safe way
that they looked at kids both obese kids and non obese kids and their
willingness to cross a very busy highway. And it turns out that the
obese kids got hit by cars more often than non obese children. It
turns out this was a virtual reality experiment and it had nothing to
do with the fact that they were obese or limitations on movement or
speed of movement. It was that the obese children were more impulsive
in a variety of contexts not just in this virtual crossing the street
thing. And it turns out the data point to the fact that impulsivity at
age 10 is actually predictive of overeating disorders at a later stage
in life. So some of these drugs that are designed to create heightened
activity in the braking system the decelerator of the reward pathway
are designed to reduce impulsivity because they suppress the release
of dopamine and they allow, hopefully they allow children and it and
when they become adults to better control the schedule of dopamine
release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=3835"&gt;Leveraging Dopamine Schedules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now let's talk about what is a dopamine schedule and how you can
leverage this in order to have heightened levels of motivation but not
get so much dopamine that you're experiencing or a crash afterwards.
And also, so that you can experience heightened pleasure from the
various pursuits that you are engaged in life. I know many of you are
interested in tools that will allow you to be more motivated to focus
longer, sleep better. That's really what the Huberman Lab Podcast is
all about but always framed in the context of neuro-biological
principles and objective mechanisms. There are some tools that we can
apply to the dopamine system and motivation that can really improve
our ability to stay in pursuit of things, as well as enjoy things
after we've achieved our goals, or even an route, our goals. And
here's the key principle. Dopamine is very subjective. Meaning you can
either allow yourself to experience the pleasure of reaching a
milestone of achieving or some craving or not. Now that won't work in
the extreme cases of drugs like cocaine and amphetamine, but it's
actually pretty powerful what one can do with the subjective system.
In fact, I'm gonna describe to you an experiment that highlights just
how powerful the subjective readout or the subjective interpretation
of a given experience really can be. Even at the level of
pharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=3922"&gt;Subjective Control of Dopamine and Drug Effects: The “Adderall” Experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love examples of subjective effects over things that would otherwise
seem hardwired because they really illustrate the interplay between
our cognition, our belief system and what would otherwise be these,
just plug and chug kind of mechanisms of, you eat X amount of
chocolate or you drink X amount of water after being water deprived
for a certain amount of time. And you get X amount of dopamine. Here's
the experiment. The experiment was just published on March 18, 2021.
So very recently, and the title of the experiment is expectation for
stimulant type modifies caffeine is effects on mood and cognition and
this was done in college students. And it's a fascinating study. What
they did is they gave college students either placebo essentially
nothing or 200 milligrams of caffeine. 200 milligrams of caffeine is
about what's in a well, a typical coffee like a medium coffee that you
buy a drip coffee or a coffee that you'd make at home. It's a fair
amount of caffeine. If you were to take in pill form it would
definitely make you feel more alert unless you were one of those
mutants literally mutants that is insensitive to caffeine. And those
mutants are pretty rare. So they took 65 undergraduate students in
college. They randomized them to either placebo or caffeine and they
told them that they were either getting caffeine or Adderall. Now,
Adderall cognitively carries a very different expectation. College
students know Adderall to be a much stronger stimulant than caffeine.
They know it to create a sort of high. This is the way the students
described it and they thought that it would increase their level of
focus and their ability to perform work. So it was really interesting
is there was definitely an effect of placebo versus caffeine. That's
not surprising, however, right, you take a placebo you may or may not
feel more alert but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine very likely
you're gonna feel very alert but there was also an effect of whether
or not the students thought they were getting caffeine or Adderall.
The subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling more stimulated,
anxious, and motivated than the subjects that received the placebo.
Okay. But the ones that expected Adderall reported stronger
amphetamine effects. So they felt much more high. They performed
better on a working memory test. And in general, they had all the
increased cognitive effects that would have been seen with Adderall
but they were only ingesting caffeine. And so this shows an
interaction between the drug caffeine and the expectation that it was
Adderall. So it led to heightened performance simply because the
students thought they were getting Adderall. And I don't know whether
or not they told them at the end that it wasn't Adderall. I doubt that
they did this. If you wanna look it up the study was published in the
journal of experimental clinical psychopharmacology. The paper is
Looby L-O-O-B-Y at all. And again, it was just published March 18th,
2021 speaks to the fact that yes, there are so-called placebo effects
but this is different than placebo. This is a belief effect about what
the specific reactions to a given stimulant ought to be. And I think
this is very important because I think that it points to the fact that
the top down the kind of higher level cognitive processes are
impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects of the say dopamine
release or our mountain adrenaline release or epinephrin release in
ways that can positively impact performance. In this case, it was a
positive improvement in working memory and focus. As long as we were
talking about caffeine I'd like to point out a study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=4143"&gt;Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills Them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's really interesting. This was published in journal of
neuroscience which is the society for neurosciences kind of flagship
journal. It's their journal. It's a good journal and what they showed
was that caffeine can increase dopamine release in the brain by about
30%. That wasn't surprising. I even said that earlier, but what they
also showed is that it has a protective effect on dopamine neurons. So
caffeine in some cases may not just increase dopamine release but it
might actually have a protective effect on dopamine neurons. Now
that's distinctly different from some claims that drugs like MDMA
ecstasy have been it's been argued can, are neurotoxic for things like
dopamine and serotonin neurons. The study that was published about
that in the journal science, which is an extremely prestigious
excellent journal later, it was shown that it wasn't MDMA ecstasy that
was given in that case. It was actually amphetamine, which is known to
destroy dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons. So what does this mean?
This means that low levels of caffeine may at least in a few studies
be protective for dopamine neurons over time that MDMA ecstasy
something that's in clinical trials right now for the treatment of
trauma PTSD of various kinds and depression but still illegal at this
point in time may although it doesn't appear yet from any published
studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps origin, urgent neuron.
So there's a real asterix and a question mark there but amphetamine
and in particular methamphetamine is very destructive for dopaminergic
neurons. So I don't think any of us needed any additional reasons to
avoid methamphetamine. This drug that creates huge increases in
dopamine and then huge crashes from that dopamine, very destructive
drug. But in addition to that seems to destroy dopaminergic neurons
from time to time, I've talked about nicotine on here, not smoking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=4257"&gt;Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because obviously smoking is bad lung cancer's bad for health, et
cetera, but nicotine in supplemental form I've mentioned that a very
famous neuroscientists Nobel prize winning scientists choose a lot of
Nicorette. I know other people that you Nicorette they believe in its
neuroprotective effects for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and indeed
nicotine can stimulate dopamine release. We talked about that earlier
whether or not it has a protective effect isn't clear the protective
effects might be through the noradrenergic and acetylcholine systems.
Those findings are still unclear but it is interesting to note that
nicotine can increase prolactin. Somewhat. There are a couple of
studies I'd be happy to link to them in the caption that shows that
nicotine taken too much over too long periods of time can also
increase prolactin which again is the opposite side of dopamine. So
today we've talked a lot about the dopamine system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=4313"&gt;Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, &amp;amp; Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad and Good)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and those kinds of schedules that will allow craving or addiction, but
what's the schedule of dopamine. That's going to allow you to maximize
on your pursuit of pleasure and your elimination of pain. And we get
the answer to that from our good friend gambling, the reason gambling
works the reason why people will throw their lives away. The reason
why people go back again and again and again to places like Las Vegas
and Atlantic city is because of the hope and anticipation it's as
those are cities in places built on dopamine, they are leveraging your
dopamine system. And I realized that there are experienced gamblers.
There are people that enjoy gambling. I'll actually just say, I like
sitting at the roulette table. I was take a designated amount of
money. It's not much, I enjoy playing a little bit of roulette. I
certainly enjoy when I win. I certainly don't like it when I lose but
I do it cheerly for the pleasure of playing. And I do it very seldom.
I don't have a gambling problem. And if I did, I'd probably tell you
but I don't have a gambling problem. Yet people throw away the entire
lives on gambling. And as a friend of mine who's a certified addiction
treatment specialist tells me that gambling addiction is a
particularly sinister because the next time really could be the thing
that changes everything. Unlike other addictions the next time really
could change everything. And that's embedded in the mind of the
gambling addict and rarely does it work out in favor of the wellbeing
of the gambling addict and their family. However, the intermittent
reinforcement schedule was discovered long ago by scientific
researchers. So this is the slot machine that every once in a while
gives you a wind to keep you playing. This is the, the probability of
winning on the craps table or the roulette table, or at blackjack just
often enough that you're willing to buy tickets, head out there play
again, go downstairs again from your room even though you swore you
were done for the night intermittent reinforcement is the most
powerful form of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something
so we can export that. We can use it for good. If there's something
that you're pursuing in life whether or not it's an academic goal or a
financial goal, a relationship goal. One of the things that you can do
to ensure that you will remain on the path to that goal for a very
long time, and that you will continue to exceed your previous
performance as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=4454"&gt;Intermittent Halting of Celebration; Enjoy Your Wins, But Not All of Them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as continue to enjoy the dopamine release that occurs when you hit the
milestones that you want to achieve is to occasionally remove reward
subjectively, let's say you set out a goal of making I'm gonna make
this quantitative with respect to finances 'cause it just is an easy
description but this could also be in sport. This could be in school.
This could be in music could be in anything creative endeavors but
let's say you set out a certain financial goal or let's say you wanna
get a certain number of followers on whatever social media platform as
you reach each one of those goals. You should know now that the amount
of dopamine is not going to peak. It's actually going to diminish and
make you crave more the key to avoiding that crash but to still keep
it in healthy levels that will allow you to continue. Your pursuit is
as you are, stair casing toward your goal. Maybe that's dollars, maybe
that's followers maybe that's grades maybe that's some other metric
it's metals or trophies. You actually want to blunt the reward
response for some of those intermediate goals. Now I'm not telling you
should celebrate your wins but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of
them. Whereas a good friend of mine who recently fortunately for him
had a great financial success. He asked me and somebody else a good
friend of mine. Who's very tuned into dopamine reward schedules
understands how they work at a really deep level. And he said," I
don't know what to do next." And we said," Oh, well, that's simple,
You should just give most of it away." And this wasn't a ploy to
receive any of the money ourselves. This was really about reducing the
impact of that reward. Now hopefully giving them money away. If you
already have enough of it would be something that was rewarding in and
of itself. But if you're a student who's pursuing goals in university
or you're an athlete, who's pursuing goals it actually makes sense
from a rational perspective. Once you understand these mechanisms to
hit a new high point of performance, or to get that A-plus or a for
you if it's an A-minus, et cetera and to tell yourself, okay, that was
good. But to actually actively blunt the reward to not go and
celebrate too intensely, because in doing that you keep your dopamine
system in check and you ensure that you're gonna stay on the path of
continued pursuit not just for that thing, but for all things big
increases in dopamine leads to big crashes in dopamine and big
increases in dopamine up the ante. They increase the extent to which
you are willing to invest time and energy in order to achieve goals
and rewards that may be out of your reach. You never really know if
you're going to succeed. So to make this crystal clear, celebrate your
wins but don't celebrate every win. That's one way that you can ensure
that you're going to continue down the path of progress. And I think
most of the learning tools that are in schools are about reward for
genuine performance. They are about encouraging us. We do have to
believe that we can perform well. One of the hallmarks of growth
mindset is the internalization that we're not getting it right yet.
The word yet is very important. And also the sense that we reward our
good behavior, our good performance, but not every time. One way to do
this is to actually take the reward and reinforcement out of your own
hands and your own mind. And you tell somebody that they are in
control of whether or not you're allowed to feel good about your wins.
Now, I realize it's very unnatural for most people but if you're
somebody who simply going to be in pursuit and you're going to really
register your wins, and you think that that's gonna actually make you
a better performer it will in the short term, but not in the longterm.
So you can lift the what Las Vegas and Atlantic city and other
gambling mechanisms and places have known for a long time. They lifted
it from the scientists. You can now take it back and you can start to
leverage that. And you just make it intermittent. You reward yourself,
not on a predictable schedule so not every other time or every third
time or every 10th time, but sometimes it's three in a row then not at
all for 10 days. So reward is important. Self reward is critically
important but make sure that you're not doing it on such a predictable
schedule that you burn out these dopamine circuits or that you
undercut your own ability to strive and achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=4718"&gt;A Story Example of Intermittent Reward to Maintain Long-Term Drive and Motivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually have a story from graduate school which I was forced into an
intermittent reinforcement schedule that I do believe has served me
very well in my scientific career and other aspects of life. My
graduate advisor was an amazing scientist. Unfortunately, she passed
away but amazing scientists and amazing human being with a very dry
and somewhat cruel sense of humor. Her name was Barbara Chapman, and
we published a paper in the journal, science and science nature and
cell are considered the big three the most competitive journals to
publish in. And I had a first author paper in science. It was really
exciting to me. I was a graduate student. I was very excited about the
discovery. I was excited that it was in science. I was just thrilled.
And I remember when the paper finally got accepted because it had
involved a ton of revisions and a lot of very hard work. And she came
in and she said," paper got accepted." I was super excited and she
just kind of sat there and nodded, and I said "are we gonna celebrate,
are we gonna have a party?" Or what, like, what are we gonna do it?
And I'll never forget her answer. She said," I think we should skip
this one." And I thought she was joking. And I said," what do you mean
skip this one?" We're gonna publish the paper. He said, yeah, we're
gonna publish the paper. But she said, " maybe when you get like four
more maybe three, maybe two too." And I thought she was messing with
me and she wasn't messing with me. And she was right. We never had a
party. We had a celebration for that paper. I think she was really
trying to instill two ideas in me. One is that the work itself was
what was supposed to be most rewarding. That practice of
experimentation a writing the paper, the experience of achieving
something they worked very hard at and that did indeed feel amazing. I
actually can still feel it in my body. Now, the excitement. So there's
a, still a dopamine release or that arc is going very long. This would
be almost 20 years ago now that this happened. So that's remarkable.
The other one is that she's right. We never went out and celebrated
and we did celebrate other wins other papers in the future and things
of that sort. But she was either consciously or subconsciously putting
me on an intermittent reward schedule. And to this day when something
really good happens I actually hesitate as to whether or not I wanna
internalize that and celebrate whether I wanna tell anybody which is
its own form of celebration because then you're getting positive
feedback. And so I'm very cautious with how I deploy dopamine release
in response to wins. It's certainly not the only way that I've
navigated my career. There are a number of other principles I
incorporate but intermittent reward for wins for achievements is a
very powerful way to ensure that you will stay on the path of pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=4885"&gt;Corrections &amp;amp; Notes About Spanish Captions &amp;amp; Other Languages Soon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in the podcast I'd like to take a moment to address some
corrections. I made some errors in previous episodes. They weren't
major errors but a couple of you pointed them out and it's important
to me that we strive for accuracy. So the first one was I talked in a
previous episode about the potential benefits for some people, not all
of ashwagandha and its role in blunting cortisol and a way of
offsetting medium term, and some long-term stress. It's a supplement
that I've benefited from. It works through the GABA system and some
other systems, someone pointed out a study that admittedly was done in
rats. I point I was focusing mainly on studies in humans during the
episode, but they point out a study that was done in rats that showed
that long-term administration of ashwagandha could actually create
some negative effects mainly on the fibroid and perhaps even the
cortisol system maybe the melatonin system. I just wanna acknowledge
that study. I'll reference it in the caption again that was a rat
study. I was focused on human studies. Please go to examine.com. Put
in ashwagandha will tell you the various effects on different aspects
of brain and body. It will also link to the pub med articles that are
relevant there it is called the human effect matrix 'cause that's only
focused on humans. That's one of the reasons I like examined.com as
it's focused on human studies, again a wonderful free resource, but I
do appreciate that you pointed out that study because I do want people
to be aware of the range of effects that these various compounds can
have as well. A couple of times in previous episodes I said five HTP
and not five HT five HT is serotonin five HTP is a precursor to a
serotonin. I was talking about supplements and compounds that can
stimulate the release of serotonin. In the previous episode, I was
actually referring to it in a context for which I don't personally
like to take five HTP. That's just my own bias for reasons I described
in that episode. But if you heard me say five HTP when I meant to say
five HT, I apologize. And then last, I just wanna point out again
something that I mentioned at the beginning which is that the Huberman
Lab Podcast is now subtitled in Spanish episodes one and two as well
as our welcome video are in Spanish. The other ones will be subtitled
soon. You can expect that within the next couple of weeks. So if you
know Spanish speaking people who prefer to digest the information in
Spanish or that's, you can look forward to the Spanish subtitles. You
need to activate those in the caption feature on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&amp;amp;t=5040"&gt;Synthesis &amp;amp; Framework, Zero-Cost Support &amp;amp; A Note About Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we don't have Spanish dubbing over on the audio
platforms. I realized once again, we've covered a lot of material.
Hopefully you now know far more about the dopamine system reward and
motivation than you did at the beginning of this podcast. Hopefully
you also understand the other side of dopamine and reward, which is
pain and the balance of this pleasure pain system, as well as the
molecules that we call or that were described in the molecule of more
book, I should say as the here and now molecules things like serotonin
and the endocannabinoids. We talked about a variety of supplement
based tools, things like vitamin B6 and zinc as they relate to
prolactin P-E-A Very interesting compound again I've never tried it
very interesting definitely in use out there L-DOPA MuCuna appearings
talked about caffeine, talked about nicotine. Talk about how some of
the effects of Adderall can be created purely cognitively without
actually ingesting Adderall, simply by telling people they're
ingesting Adderall giving them caffeine. Very interesting study that I
referenced a little bit earlier, and we talked about scheduling
dopamine adopting the intermittent reward schedule for yourself in
order to ensure long-term engagement with pursuits that I hope are
healthy pursuits and ones that serve you well this was by no means an
exhaustive coverage of all things, dopamine and motivation. It was by
no means. The only time that we're gonna talk about dopamine and
motivation, next episode we're gonna continue to talk about emotions
from yet another perspective but hopefully you have enough now to
think about in the meantime, and that you can consider adopting in
your own life and practices as always. I really wanna thank you for
your time and attention. If you learned something useful today, please
pass it along. One of the things that we teach in science that I think
is really wonderful to adopt in general in life is this idea of watch
one, do one, teach one. This is what we tell graduate students and med
students and post-docs watch somebody do something, learn it then do
it, apply it, see if it works for you and then teach it. So it's
usually not watch one, do one, teach one. It's usually watch one do 20
teach as many people as you possibly want. I'm not looking for
attribution. These are tools that are grounded in neuroscience for
which I can't claim attribution. I'm just passing them along so that
you can adopt them if you like and pass them along. If you think
people can benefit from them, many of you have continued to ask how

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] My name is
Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my
teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my
desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about
science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping
with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our
first sponsor today is Theragun. Theragun is a handheld percussive
therapy device that releases deep muscle tension. I was first
introduced to Theragun in 2017 while on a laboratory expedition. We
were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean filming great white sharks for
my laboratory studies on fear using virtual reality we were working
very hard around the clock and I and other people on the trip were
picking up a lot of aches and pains and just kind of chronic soreness.
Couple of people had injuries that were flaring up because of all the
hard work and lack of sleep. Someone had a Theragun and pretty soon it
was getting passed around. It became the most coveted device on board.
Everyone was using it to work on these different sites of soreness.
And I really fell in love with the thing so much so that when I got
back, I immediately purchased one and I've used it almost daily ever
since, I use it on muscles that are sore, I use it on areas that I'm
really working on to release tension and improve tissue quality and so
forth. The great thing about Theragun is it's really quiet so you can
use it while you're in a conversation or while you're watching a movie
and it doesn't disrupt those activities at all. If you want to try
Theragun you can try Theragun by going to theragun.com/huberman to get
your gen four Theragun, they start at $199. But if you think about it,
a massage, which is an hour long or 90 minutes long is typically in
that range of costs. And this is something you can use every day
whenever you want, and even while enjoying other activities. So that's
theragun.com/huberman. The second sponsor of today's podcast is
InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that
analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand
your body and help you reach your health goals. The great thing about
InsideTracker is that it gives you data that you can make sense of.
I've long been a believer in getting blood samples taken and more
recently I've become a believer in getting DNA samples taken in order
to understand what's going on at the level of hormones, metabolic
factors and other things that profoundly influence our immediate and
long-term health. The problem always has been getting those samples
taken and making sense of those samples. InsideTracker makes all of
that really easy. They'll even come to your home to take the samples.
Then you get the information back. And while typically after getting
information back there's these long lists of numbers and nobody knows
what to do with them, InsideTracker makes it really easy to interpret
what those numbers mean. And it points to things in terms of
lifestyle, exercise, nutrition, and so forth that can help you adjust
some of the numbers that you might need to bring down or up to put
into the appropriate normal range. So I find this whole process to be
immensely valuable for guiding my health choices and also just for
giving me peace of mind about how my body and the rest of my health
are doing internally. Something you just can't know without a blood
and DNA test. If you want to try InsideTracker, you can go to
insidetracker.com/huberman, and you'll get 25% off any of their
programs, you want to put Huberman at checkout. So that's
insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans
and put Huberman at checkout. The third sponsor of today's podcast is
Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
probiotic drink. I started using Athletic Greens in 2012. So I'm
delighted that they're a sponsor of the podcast. The reason I started
using Athletic Greens and the reason I still take it once or twice per
day, is that I find it very hard to know what vitamins and minerals I
need to take. And by drinking Athletic Greens, I get it all in one
easy to consume great tasting formula. I really do like the way it
tastes. I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.
And to me it's delicious. The other thing about Athletic Greens that I
really like are the probiotics there are so much data out there now
telling us, and I certainly believe based on the data that I've seen
that probiotics are really important for support of the gut
microbiome, the gut brain axis, the immune system and many other
aspects of our biology. So with Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins
the minerals and the probiotics that I need. If you want to try
Athletic Greens you can go to athletigreens.com/huberman. And if you
do that, they'll also give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Vitamin
D3 we also know is really important for things like immune system and
metabolic support. So that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get
Athletic Greens and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2. And they'll give
you five free travel packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=300"&gt;Emotions: Aligning Mind &amp;amp; Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we're talking all about emotions, and emotions are central to
our entire experience of life. Whether or not we're happy or sad or
depressed or angry is our life experience. And yet I think with all
the importance we've placed on emotions. Very few people actually
understand how emotions arise in our brain and body. And I mentioned
brain and body because as you'll see today emotions really capture the
brain body relationship. We cannot say that emotions arise just from
what happens in our head. It also involves events, biological events
chemical events within our body. The other thing about emotions is
that there's no real agreement as to what's a good emotion or a bad
emotion. Today we're gonna talk about the biology of the chemicals and
pathways that give rise to emotions. And I'm going to equip you with
several, if not many tools that will allow you to regulate and change
and steer your emotions should you want, but not using the typical
advice. You know, everyone's probably heard of this thing. Oh if
you're feeling depressed, just smile, you know, it's impossible to be
depressed while smiling. Look, if that were true we wouldn't have any
depressed people because depressed people don't want to be depressed.
And it is not the case that simply smiling will reverse depression or
sadness. And it's simply not the case that smiling can inhibit
sadness. It just doesn't work that way. However, it is the case that
certain things that are happening in our body influence how our brain
functions and the chemicals that are released. And today we're gonna
talk a lot about how the brain and body interact to create these
things called emotions in the context of food and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=401"&gt;Nutrients, Neurochemicals and Mood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the reason we're doing that is not because I am beating the drum
about particular diet regimens or anything. In fact, I'm not gonna do
any of that. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna review some of the most
important scientific data that point to how ingesting certain
nutrients, both macro nutrients like proteins, fats, and
carbohydrates, as well as micronutrients can impact the chemicals in
our brain that give rise to the feelings of being happy or sad or
sleepy or alert when you want to be sleepy or sleepy when you want to
be alert. So this is sure to be a broad discussion and yet we're gonna
get very specific about what emotions are, how they arise in the body,
tools that one can use in order to better control their emotions,
tools that people can use to believe it or not feel happier or feel
calmer. And that's because in the last 20 years or so there's been an
explosion of scientific studies exploring how the brain and body
interact to support certain neurochemicals that give us these feelings
of being alert and happy or depressed or certain that our life is
gonna be terrible or certain that our life is going to be great. So as
mysterious as all that might sound and confusing as all that might
sound we're gonna make it very clear today. And you're gonna come away
from this conversation with a lot of tools that you can act on
immediately. And those tools are grounded in scientific data. We are
gonna provide links to several of the studies, and I'm gonna mention
several of those studies as we go along. But overall, the goal today
is for you to understand how moods and emotions arise and the
different pathways in your brain and body that allow them to happen
and how you can use those pathways to change those emotions and the
tools that you can rely on in very specific ways to shift from being,
say, slightly depressed, to feeling happier. There actually are ways
to do that, or from feeling too alert and anxious to feeling calmer.
And these are tools that are distinct from the tools I've talked about
in previous episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=519"&gt;Primitive Expressions and Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion around emotions has a long and rich history going back
to Darwin. And even long before Darwin, this is a conversation that
philosophers and scientists have been having for hundreds if not
thousands of years. The idea that Darwin put forth and that was really
attractive for about the last hundred years was that emotions are
universal and that some of the facial expressions around emotion are
universal and other people have capitalized on that idea. And to some
extent it's true. I mean, I think that the two most robust examples of
that would be when we see something or we smell something or we taste
something that we like, there does tend to be a postural leaning in.
We tend to inhale air at that time, we tend to bring in more of
whatever chemical substances there is. We tend to these mm's and kind
of lean in closer to things that are attractive to us. And when we see
and experience things that we don't like sometimes it's a mild
aversion. We just kind of lean back or look away. Other times it's an
intensive version of disgust and we tend to cringe our face. We tend
to avoid inhaling any of the chemicals. This probably has roots in
ancient biological mechanisms that are to prevent us from ingesting
things that are bad for us, chemical compounds and tastes that might
be poisonous. So much of the foundation of any discussion about
emotion has to center around this kind of push pull of attraction to
things or aversion from things. Now that's a very basic way of
thinking about emotions but if you think about it, it works for a lot
of different circumstances and in the brain everywhere from the deep
circuits of the brain to the more kind of what we call higher order
evolved centers of the brain. We have this push pull thing where
either a previous episode, I talked about go, the circuits that allow
you to emphasize action and then no go circuits, the circuits and the
basal ganglia that allow you to de-emphasize action and prevent
action. We talked about how that's a push pull. So aversion and
attraction is a push pull too. Delight or happiness or excitement are
attractions to certain things and ideas, songs, people, places, foods
aversion is a leaning out. It's a disgust, it's an avoidance. And so
we can break down the discussion about emotions into these simpler
versions of themselves, but at the core of that of attraction or
aversion is an important theme that you might realize already. But
most people tend to overlook which is that there's an action there
you're either moving forward or you're moving away from something. And
any time you're talking about action in the nervous system, you're
talking about motor behaviors. You're talking about literally the
contraction of muscles to move you toward or away from things. And any
time you're talking about nerve to muscle and action, you're talking
about the brain and the body, because the brain can't move itself that
the brain has a body so that the organism can move. And the body has a
brain so that the organism, you, can move toward or away from things
that you deem to be good or bad for you. Now, some of these things
that we're attracted to and some of them that we avoid are what we
call innate or hardwired. You know, when we taste bitter compounds,
I'm not saying about bitter like a little bit of a bitters in your
drink or something like that, but really bitter compounds. We tend to
avoid those because they're associated with poisons. When we taste
things that are sweet or that are savory we tend to pursue more of
those. We tend to lean toward those so to speak and we tend to not
avoid them. So there are circuits in the brain for aversion and for
attraction toward things. And the body is governing a lot of that. And
so immediately in this conversation I want to raise an important point&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=750"&gt;The Vagus Nerve: Truth, Fiction, Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is about a nerve pathway that many, many people have heard of
that gets discussed all the time. And that is one of the most kind of
oversold for the wrong reasons and undersold, unfortunately, for its
real power, which is the vagus nerve. So the vagus nerve is one, not
the only, but one way in which our brain and body are connected and
regulates our emotional states. Now, many of you have probably heard
about polyvagal theory. I'm gonna talk about this today. Polyvagal
theory was popularized by Stephen Porges and it's an interesting
theory, certain aspects of it, frankly, hold up to the science, some
of it doesn't. And I'm gonna discuss all of that today. A lot of the
vagus and the excitement about the vagus, V-A-G-U-S, is because it's
somehow got into the mind of the public that the vagus is involved in
calming us down. So what is the vagus nerve? Okay, we're gonna make
this really simple, in particular for those that are just listening,
you can just imagine this, for those are watching I'll point to the
various areas, but basically vagus is the 10th cranial nerve which
basically means that the neurons, the control center of each of those
neurons in the vagus lives just kind of near the neck, right? And a
branch of the vagus goes into the brain. They send a little wire into
the brain. The other branch goes into the periphery but not just the
gut. It goes into the stomach, the intestines the heart, the lungs,
and the immune system. So this vagus nerve is incredible because it's
taking information from the body and it has two directions. The first
is what we call sensory. So it's sensing things that are happening in
the gut in the lungs, everything, for example, in the lungs when our
lungs are distended, the vagus nerve senses that and sends that
information up into the brain. It also consents things in the gut like
how distended or empty your stomach happens to be, it can sense heart
rate. It can sense your immune system, whether or not you have
bacteria or things invading you in your body. So it sends that
information up to the brain. So it's a two-way street and sensory
information is going up to the brain. That's all vagus. So it's like a
super highway sensory information going one way and in the other
direction is motor control. So the vagus is not just for sensing
things. It's actually for controlling things. It's got a sensory
pathway and a motor pathway. So that's the first thing I think
everyone should know about the vagus. In fact, it's so important that
I feel like this is as important as people knowing that walking
involves flexors and extensors. And if you don't think that's
important, it's as important as walking, frankly, because the vagus is
the way in which you can govern the brain body connection. And in
which you can steer various aspects of your mood and wellbeing, but
most people just don't understand how to use it. So first you got to
understand what it is. So you've got sensory information coming from
all these different organs of the body up to the brain. You've got
motor information going from the brain back to the body. And so you've
got this super highway within you. Now what actually regulates the
vagus. Oftentimes you'll hear things like, oh this particular behavior
rubbing your face at a particular location or breathing in a
particular way, or a warm bath or something stimulates the vagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=945"&gt;“Vagus Stimulation”: A Terrible Concept&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, right now, I want everyone to know that, quote unquote,
stimulating the vagus broadly speaking is a terrible way to think
about the vagus because do you know what, if you have a contaminant
inside your body the vagus senses that and projects that information
to your brain, and you start to generate a fever you start to try and
kill that contaminant in your body. So I don't know that you want to
stimulate the vagus just as a general theme today, we're going to get
specific about how you can activate particular circuits, certain
pathways from certain organs to the brain in order to feel better or
relieve certain conditions. But you certainly don't want to just
stimulate the vagus. Now excitement about the vagus in part is because
of what quite honestly, was a fairly pioneering theory about the vagus
which is his polyvagal theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=995"&gt;Polyvagal Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So polyvagal, the word poly means many, is cool because it
acknowledges that the vagus has a lot of different branches. It's not
just one thing. And so I really liked that. I liked the naming
polyvagal. The idea that Porges has put forward was that there's a
dorsal vagus, which is kind of runs in the back of the spinal cord,
which is involved in alertness and activation and kind of fight or
flight type stuff. And that there's a ventral pathway and that that's
involved in more kind of empathic behaviors. That is not quite in
agreement with the modern anatomy, but he was doing the best with what
he had at the time. So, okay. The problem I have with the polyvagal
theory is the way that it's discussed people often say, oh if your
dorsal vagus is too active then you tend to be someone who's a little
too keyed up and people who are kind of in a state of freeze or kind
of flacid and kind of like just not really active and they're just
lethargic. Well, then that pathway is hypoactive. It should be more
active. So there are a lot of theories about how psychology maps onto
the vagus. That as far as I know, don't map to any real physiology.
Now, the other problem with this kind of the way that the polyvagal
theory is discussed probably not by the real experts, but by a lot of
people is that people start to diagnose different psychological and
physical manifestations through the vagus. They would say things like,
Oh this person is hyper flexible at the joints and therefore their
dorsal vagus isn't active enough or something like that. And it's
really kind of gone way outside the lane lines. So today we're gonna
clean up a lot of that. Let's make it really simple about how the
vagus actually works. At least as we understand it today in 2021.
First of all, as I mentioned, you have sensory information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=1107"&gt;Vagus Senses Many Things, &amp;amp; Moves Our Organs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the same way that you detect light with your eyes or you hear sounds
with your ears, you have sensors in your gut that sense how full or
empty your gut is. It can also sense how acidic your gut is. It can
sense various things within your gut. Your heart is doing the same.
It's informing the brain how fast your heart is beating, how full your
lungs are has been communicated and then the status of your immune
system. So the way to think about the vagus is the same way I would
think about the eyes. The eyes are looking at colors, they're looking
at motion they're looking how bright it is. And each one of those
things, those features is telling the brain something different. So
the brain can decide when to be awake or asleep whether or not it's
looking at somebody's attractive or unattractive. The vagus nerve is
also analyzing many features within the body and informing the brain
of how to feel about that and what to do. So a really good example
that I think is an exciting one is as it relates to sugar. So we all
know that sweet things generally tastes good. I'm not particularly a
fan of very sweet things. You know, I'd much rather have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=1175"&gt;Sugar Sensing Without Perception of Sweetness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak. I like savory fatty foods, but
I do like sweet foods. And most people find sweet foods to be
attractive. They want them, they might or they might not be able to
regulate their behavior around them, but they want them. And what's
really interesting is that for hundreds of years people have thought
that that's because of the way that sweet foods taste. So that makes
sense, right? You eat something that tastes sweet. You want more of
it. Well, it turns out that it's much more interesting than that. When
you eat something sweet within your stomach, you have cells, neurons,
that sense the presence of sugary foods independent of their taste and
signal to the brain. So those sensors, those neurons send information
up the vagus to your brain goes through a series of stations. And then
you release dopamine. This molecule that makes you want more of
whatever it is that you just ingested. In fact, this pathway is so
powerful that they've done experiments where they completely numb all
the taste and feeling in somebody's mouth they're blindfolded. So they
don't know what they're eating and they're eating a food. That's
either sugary or not sugary. And what they find is that even though
people can't taste the sugary food they crave more of the food that
contains sugar because of the sensors in the gut, that sense sugar. So
to put this differently, you actually have sensors within your body
that make you crave sugar independent of the sweet taste of those
things. Now that's incredible. And what it does, and what it tells us
is that we have circuits in our body that are driving us towards
certain behaviors and making us feel good even though we can't
perceive them. Now, for those of you that are really interested in gut
intuition and kind of gut feelings this is a gut feeling except this
is a chemical gut feeling. This is a particular set of neurons
detecting that something in your body has a particular feature, in
this case the presence of sugars, and sending information to the brain
essentially to control your behavior. And I find this remarkable,
because what it means is that what we call attractive isn't always
coming from our thoughts about that or our feelings, or even our
perception. We are drawn to particular foods and we're drawn to
perhaps also to particular people, places and other things because of
information that's coming from our body. And we're gonna talk about
what one can do with this information. I know many people are
thoughtful or concerned about sugars these days thinking we all ingest
too much sugar. There's sugar snuck into all the things we eat. And
indeed, that's true. I mean, this should completely reframe the way
that we think about the sort of so-called hidden sugars in foods. What
this means is that even if a food is very savory like a piece of pizza
or a piece of bread or even like a salad dressing if there's sugar
snuck into that and you can't taste it you will still crave more of
that thing without knowing that you crave it because it has sugar. In
other words, you might find yourself wanting certain foods and not
knowing why you want those foods. So I find this to be a fascinating
aspect of our biology and yes, it relates to mood and emotion. And
we'll talk about how that is in a moment. So let's just back up a bit
and ask the question why do we eat certain things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=1380"&gt;Eating-Induced Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why do certain foods make us feel good? And other foods actually
make us feel anxious. I think some people may be familiar with this.
Other people might not, but most people don't realize that as you
approach eating there's an anxiety associated with that. It's an
alertness. Remember in the previous discussions, or even if you don't
and you haven't seen those, all of your moods and feelings of
wellbeing are anchored on this continuum of alertness versus calmness.
And we hear so often about rest and digest. You know that, oh, after
we eat, we feel really nice and full, hopefully comfortably full and
not too full. And we're relaxing. And we feel satiated, it's
associated with serotonin this molecule of satiation. That's all true.
But what most people don't know is that there's an area of the
hypothalamus. So deepen the brain kind of in the middle deep portion
of the brain called the lateral hypothalamus. And the lateral
hypothalamus is really interesting because it controls feeding, but it
inhibits feeding. It stops us from feeding. And there's another area
in the brain. If you want names, I'll give them to you. If you don't
want names, just ignore them, delete them from your memory and
awareness, called the locus coeruleus, now the locus coeruleus sits
back further in the brainstem and it releases norepinephrine which is
essentially adrenaline. It makes us feel alert. Now, locus coeruleus
has a lot of different functions in the brain, but when we are going
to eat let's say we walk into a restaurant, we sit down or we're
preparing a meal, locus coeruleus is known to release noradrenaline in
the brain. It's creating a kind of alertness. This has ancient
utility, but it's creating this alertness. And for many people, they
experience that as they approach food as stress as anxiety. But what's
interesting is that as we approach food locus coeruleus is releasing
all these molecules that make us feel more anxious and alert sometimes
it's felt as excitement. And that asks probably to do with how we feel
about food generally, are we happy with our relationship with food?
Are we trying to restrict our relationship to food, are people coming
over for dinner, all that will play in of course, but there's a
certain stress and anxiety upon approach to food. And as we approach
food and we feel that anxiety locus coeruleus activates the lateral
hypothalamus in a way that inhibits feeding that makes us not want to
eat. So a lot of people who have kind of pre-meal anxiety or anxiety
around food and they can't seem to just calm down and have a good meal
to access that later rest and digest. A lot of that is because of this
heightened stress upon approach to food and a lot of the tools that
are out there, both for eating disorders and for just kind of the
general public who isn't suffering from eating disorders, things like
mindfulness around meals. You know, they always tell you you should
never eat when stressed. I'm sorry, but my life is not organized in a
way that I can do that. I would never eat. Right because I eat when
I'm awake and I don't know if I'm stressed, but I don't think I am but
I tend to run around a lot during the day. I don't generally take time
to do two or three deep breaths before I eat. I generally will just
eat. That can be healthy or unhealthy depending on the quality of your
digestion. I think using digestion as a guide is good, but a lot of
people aren't aware that this interaction between locus coeruleus and
lateral hypothalamus is a basic mechanism where we are supposed to get
a little bit alert and anxious around mealtime. And then as we eat,
the mechanisms for calming and satiation are supposed to kick in and
those mechanisms involve as I mentioned earlier, two things. One is
how things taste, digestion starts in the mouth. Of course, we taste
our food. Everyone tells us we should chew our food more. Yes, that
can improve digestion. We're not supposed to drink too many fluids as
we eat. That's true too, but a lot of how we feel while we eat and
after we eat is because of this vagus sensing of what's in our gut.
It's sending information all the time. Is there sugar? Are there fats?
Are there contaminants? There are a lot of information. These so-
called parallel pathways that are going up into our brain that
regulate whether or not we want to eat more of something or not. And
there are accelerators, things that make us want to eat more, like
sugar and fats because those are nutrient dense. And they helps
generally, at least in the short term support the survival of animals,
but also amino acids. And this is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=1650"&gt;We Eat Until Our Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of data, but much of what comes from the data on what
people eat and how much they eat is from a subconscious detection of
how many amino acids and what the array, meaning the constellation of
amino acids is in a given food. And it's fair to say that the sum
total of these studies pointing in a direction where people will
basically eat, not until their stomach is full but until the brain
perceives that they have adequate intake of amino acids. Now, this is
a conversation that comes up in the context of you know, the meat,
only the keto, the kind of zone diet, the Mediterranean diet, the
vegan diet. I'm largely going to ignore the kind of strict camps
today. I will talk a little bit about it, because I think each one of
them actually taps into something important about this brain body
relationship that the other ones don't. But I don't want to get into a
discussion about the ethics of different foods of animal based or non
animal based. 'Cause that's not the topic today. It's really about
nutrient sensing and amino acid sensing. So we generally will eat
until our gut tells our brain that we have adequate amounts of these
amino acids. Amino acids of course are important because they are the
building blocks of sure, muscle, and the other things in our body that
need repair. But what most people don't realize is that amino acids
are what the neurochemicals in the brain are made from. Now, this is
vitally important. Okay, so we've heard dopamine is this molecule that
makes you feel good. Actually dopamine is a molecule that makes you
feel good. It's released within the brain. And it does feel very good
when you have dopamine release, dopamine releases caused by surprise,
excitement, events that you're looking forward to and they turnout
well, it is inhibited by events you're looking forward to that don't
work out when someone says they're going to call that you're really
really excited to talk to, and then they don't, or you thought a movie
was gonna be really great and it's not, or you expect a meal to be
really delicious. And it's kind of, eh, and we actually there's a name
for that. It's called reward prediction error. And you can actually
use this in the context&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=1785"&gt;Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown and Wanting More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of meals and plans in a way that's very useful with yourself and
people you know, essentially if you expect something to be really
terrific it really does place a higher expectation at the chemical
level. So if you don't get as much dopamine as you're expecting from
something, so you you hear about a really great restaurant or a place
that has a really, in my case, I have, I wouldn't call it an
addiction. I would call it more of an affliction for croissants. The
best vegetable of course, is the croissant. And I get really excited
about the fact that someone will tell me, oh there's this place and
they have incredible croissants. You gotta go there. So I get really
excited, and I'll go. And just them telling me that it's gonna be
really terrific raises an expectation, a dopamine expectation. And
unless those croissants are amazing chances are I'm going to
experience them as less good, less satisfying. I will truly release
less dopamine than I would had they just said, oh yeah, I think that
there are croissants down the street. Or if I just tried one at
random, and that's because of this reward prediction error your
expectation of something releases dopamine and the actual event
releases dopamine. And if the event related dopamine does not exceed
the expectation or at least match it, there's a much higher tendency
that you won't pursue that thing again. So dopamine is really powerful
and it's not just the molecule of reward. It is the molecule of
desire. It's the molecule of wanting not just the molecule of having.
And a book, since people often ask for book recommendations. I don't
know the author personally, but I love the book. It's called "The
Molecule Of More". It's a terrific book. I wish I had written it,
frankly, but if you want to learn more about dopamine reward
prediction error and how dopamine regulates various aspects of your
emotional and motivational life, it's a terrific read. Dopamine is
what's going to lead us to want to eat more of something or to not
want more of something, because dopamine really is about craving. It's
about motivation and it's about desire. And as I mentioned, these
amino acid sensors in our gut are detecting how many amino acids but
they're also detecting which amino acids. And there's a particular
amino acid called L-tyrosine which comes from food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=1921"&gt;L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, &amp;amp; Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look up online, which foods contain L-tyrosine. It is in
meats. It is in nuts. It is also in some plant-based foods. L-tyrosine
is the precursor to a couple other molecules like L-DOPA, et cetera,
that make dopamine. And so there's a misconception out there that most
of the serotonin is in our gut. And most of the dopamine is in our
gut. And therefore our mood is in our gut. That's not quite the way it
works. Okay. we'll talk about serotonin in a moment but dopamine is
synthesized from the amino acids that you eat. However, the dopamine
neurons that give rise to these feelings of good or wanting more or
desire and motivation, those reside in the brain. So we don't want to
get too confused. We want to respect and honor the power of the gut
and this vagal pathway, but it's really neurons within your brain that
drive the pursuit and decision-making, so what does this mean? Well,
some people make too little dopamine. Some people make so little
dopamine that they need prescription dopamine. They need L-DOPA,
people with Parkinson's take L-DOPA and other compounds to increase
dopamine because Parkinson's is associated with deficits in movement,
starts as a tremor, actually starts with some other things that are
interesting. We'll talk about in a moment, but Parkinson's is a
depression. It's a blunting of motivation and mood and effect, and
it's a tremor. And then eventually in severe conditions it's
challenges in speaking and walking so that some famous examples would
be Muhammad Ali, Michael J. Fox, the great boxing trainer, Freddie
Roach, like these people have Parkinson's and they at least later in
their life had challenges speaking. Now it's not just fighters that
develop Parkinson's as far as I know, Michael J. Fox wasn't a fighter.
People can develop Parkinson's and Parkinson's is a depletion of
dopamine neurons in the brain. And it's not just movement challenges.
It's challenges with mood. Now, hopefully most of you all of you don't
have Parkinson's,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=2044"&gt;Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs of Abuse, Wellbutrin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it's clear that dietary L-tyrosine supports the healthy production
of things like dopamine and as well as other factors within the brain.
Now, some people immediately ask, well should I supplement L-tyrosine?
So let's just talk about that because that's gonna come up. Full
disclosure, I sometimes take L-tyrosine. I'm not taking it right now,
but I take it only occasionally, you can buy this in capsule form. It
does increase kind of a mood and elevation and alertness. It is over
the counter. You have to check with your doctor. I'm not responsible
for your healthcare and I'm not a doctor, whether or not it's safe for
you, people with preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions like mania
should probably not take L-tyrosine. The other thing about taking
L-tyrosine is there is a crash, okay? It's not a massive crash if you
take it at appropriate doses and it's right for you but it can produce
a crash and a lethargy and a kind of brain fog after the next day or
so. And so L-tyrosine however can be ingested through foods or through
supplementation to increase dopamine levels. That's well-known, taken
chronically however, it can disrupt those dopamine pathways. Now there
are other drugs that will increase L-tyrosine and dopamine as well.
But those are severe enough that they generally tend to have addictive
properties. So things like methamphetamine, things like cocaine are
terrible because they really ramp up the dopamine system so much that
people really can't achieve dopamine release through any other
mechanisms. But food and the ingestion of L-tyrosine has a profound
effect on our levels of dopamine. It takes a little while but that
really will impact level of mood. Certain antidepressants fall into
the category of dopaminergic antidepressants. One of the most famous
ones of course is Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin with developed because a lot
of the other antidepressants tend to make people feel kind of
lethargic or they had side effect profiles that people didn't like. So
they developed this thing that, the generic name is different, but
it's generally called Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin activates dopamine and
epinephrin, which is a substrate of dopamine. And both of those are
involved in motivation and alertness and effort. So you might say,
wow, this sounds like a great drug. However, this drug, the side
effect profile tends to be the things that are associated with
elevated mood and alertness. So this isn't like taking some
L-tyrosine. This isn't like eating some tyrosine rich foods. This is
really a much greater release of dopamine and epinephrin, and it
increases things like anxiety, sweating, the pupils dilate. It has
certain effects on, in particular people with epilepsy, it's been used
somewhat successfully for smoking cessation, but again, it's not for
everybody and I'm not here to encourage the use of these things. I'm
just describing the biology and the rationale for why these drugs were
developed. So let's back up a second. Let's just kind of take stock of
where we're at. We have a brain body connection. There are many of
them, but one of the main ones is the vagus nerve. The vagus collects
information about a lot of things, breathing, heart rate stuff that's
happening in the gut, et cetera, and gut by the way, includes the
stomach and the intestines, sends that information up to the brain.
The brain is using that information to decide one of two things, move
toward something or move away. It can also pause, but essentially
pausing is not moving toward. So that's the dopamine pathway and foods
rich in L-tyrosine generally give us an elevated mood and make us want
to do more of whatever it is that we happen to be doing as well as
other things, motivation, generalizes to other things it's not unique
to just ingesting foods but foods that give us a big pulse of dopamine
will make us crave more of that food. It will make us crave more of
the activity that led to the ingestion of that food. And as I
mentioned earlier, a lot of that is happening at a subconscious level
that you're not even aware of. And this is why I think the concern
about hidden sugars and over ingestion of sugars is serious because
it's not just that the sugars are impacting our blood glucose in
negative ways. Although often it is, it's not just the obesity crisis
that's happening. It's also the fact that it's disrupting our dopamine
systems. Now that doesn't mean all sugar is bad. Some people have a
quite healthy relationship to sugar but I think most people are just
not aware that sugar isn't just operating at the level of taste it's
operating at the level of neurochemicals and it's doing it
subconsciously. So I'd like to talk about some of the other pathways
between brain and body that regulate our moods and emotions but also
are actionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=2309"&gt;Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety and Prozac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the other neuromodulator that's really interesting in the context
of the vagus is serotonin. Serotonin, just to remind you is a
neuromodulator therefore it creates a bias in which neural circuits
which neurons in the brain and body are going to be active and it
makes it less likely the other ones are going to be active. I think
it's fair to say without ever having measured it that my bulldog
Costello, just his brain and body must be swimming in serotonin,
because he's very calm and he eats a lot but he generally feels pretty
sated. He's kind of an animal that's obsessed with comforts. He's a
bit of a hedonist, and serotonin when it's elevated tends to make us
feel really comfortable and kind of blissed out wherever we are. And
that contrast with dopamine and epinephrin which mainly put us in
pursuit of things. Motivation is pursuit. Serotonin is more about
feeling really comfy where we are. The conversation around the brain
body relationship and mood and serotonin for many years was, well, you
eat a big meal. The gut is distended. You've got all the nutrients you
need you rest and digest and serotonin is released. That's sorta true,
but there's a lot more going on and a lot more that's interesting and
actionable that's going on. First of all, some of you, but perhaps not
all have heard that more than 90% of the serotonin that we make is in
our gut. And indeed we have a lot of serotonin in our gut. We have
neurons in our gut that makes serotonin. We have neurons in our brain
that make serotonin, but here's the deal. Most of the serotonin that
impacts our mood and our mental state is not in our gut. Most of it is
in the neurons of the brain in an area called the raphae nucleus of
the brain, there are a few other locations too, and those are the
neurons that control whether or not we feel satiated or not. Whether
or not we feel happy and calm. You can't have a discussion about
serotonin without having discussion about antidepressants. Because
during the late eighties and early nineties there was this explosion
in the number of prescription drugs that were released. Things like
first one and most famous one is Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil, a number of
other ones that are so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitors. That's a long acronym, but basically those drugs work by
preventing the gobbling up of serotonin or re-uptake of serotonin into
neurons after it's been released which leads to more serotonin overall
which means to elevate serotonin. And indeed those drugs were and can
be very useful for certain people to feel better in cases of
depression and some other clinical disorders as well. So I really
don't want to dismiss them as useless or dangerous for everybody. They
can be quite useful for many people. Not everyone responds well to
them as I'm sure you've all heard. And their side effect profile has
affects like blunting affect. It can make people feel kind of flat,
kinda meh, it can reduce appetite for food. It can reduce appetite for
sex. It can do all sorts of things, or it can work really well.
Sometimes it's a dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin is
fascinating however, because how well those neurons in the raphe work
is impacted by some events within the gut. Although you might be
surprised to find out what those events are. So let's go a little bit
deeper into the gut. And again, the gut includes the stomach and then
the small intestine in the large intestine and ask like, what is going
on with serotonin in the gut? How is it impacting serotonin in the
brain? And let's think about this in the context of how some of us
might want to increase or decrease our serotonin levels. So as far as
I know, there aren't any really good at home blood tests for things
like serotonin and dopamine. There's some commercial products out
there. But to me, just to me, I'm not particularly impressed. You
know, it's not the same as getting your hormones levels measured or
your metabolic factors measured, that's can be daunting. It can be
done rigorously. There are tests out there. There are even some,
believe it or not. There's some questionnaires that, and I think
actually last year it made some of the bigger newspapers, are you more
of a dopamine or a serotonin? Are you a this or that? I find that
stuff to be a little silly although I do appreciate, and like the fact
that people are thinking about and talking about neuromodulators there
aren't really great ways to measure these things outside the clinic.
There's some great clinical tools that you can get inside of a
hospital or from a proper endocrinologist or neurologist, but no great
at-home tool. So maybe that's a call to arms for some of you
entrepreneurial folks out there to create these tests, accurate tests
please, that could be done at home. But some people feel like they're
too anxious or they're always in a motivated state and they're trying
to adjust their serotonin. Many people adjust their serotonin by just
eating more food and carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin.
I've talked about this on a previous podcast but I personally am a big
fan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=2618"&gt;Eating to Promote Dopamine (Daytime) &amp;amp; Serotonin (Night Time)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at least for me is I usually fast and exercise in the early part of
the day I eat a relatively high protein and moderate fat zero carb or
low carb meal at lunch in the afternoon to stay alert because those
foods tend to favor dopamine production acetylcholine production,
epinephrin production and alertness. My mood is generally pretty good
most of the time. And then as evening comes around and I'm concerned
about sleep and a good night's sleep, not concerned in an anxious way,
but I want to get a good night's sleep. I will ingest foods that
promote serotonin release because they contain a lot of tryptophan. So
if I do eat meat, it would be like a white meat, turkey meat. I don't
tend to, I've never liked turkey. I don't mind the animal but I don't
like ingesting the meat, but starchy carbohydrates will increase
serotonin. Some people also will take serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=2670"&gt;Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, &amp;amp; Caution About Sleep Disruptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now buy 5-HTP supplements. This is a little bit tricky. 5-HTP
supplements can of course increase 5-HTP. It is 5-HTP or serotonin but
that sometimes can create problems in endogenous or self-made
production of serotonin. So I'm never a fan of taking things very
close to the chemical you're trying to increase for very long periods
of time. Maybe for occasional use. I have the problem that if I take
serotonin supplements, 5-HTP, I fall asleep. The sleep I have is very
intense and I wake up three or four hours later. And we know based on
sleep studies with good measurements in the lab that serotonin release
tends to be in the later part of the night. And so by taking it early
in the night it really can disrupt the pattern of sleep in the depth
of sleep. Nonetheless, some people are interested in taking serotonin
to get some of the more blissed out effects. You can achieve that with
foods. As I mentioned, that are carbohydrate rich. So as you're seeing
this isn't really a discussion about nutrition per se. This is
discussion about food which contains amino acids, amino acids being
the precursors to neuromodulators and neuromodulators having a
profound effect on your overall state of alertness or calmness,
happiness, sadness, and wellbeing. So there are a number of things
that one can take. As I mentioned, one of them being 5-HTP itself. Now
I'm not recommending people take anything, but if you're interested in
what this does and you want to explore this of course you'd want
permission from your doctor. You can go to this free website. I love
this resource. They don't pay me to say that, but I just love this
resource. I've followed it for a long time called examine.com. Thank
you folks at examine.com for putting this free resource out on the web
that has links through what they call the human effect matrix. So it's
links to all the PubMed studies for particular effects of particular
compounds that one combined and just incredible as well as important
health warnings. So I'm not gonna read through everything but if you
were to go to examine.com as I have now and you put in 5-HTP they're
only looking at things that have strong evidence. PubMed articles,
articles that are in the PubMed archive. So for instance, I didn't
know this, but 5-HTP produces a notable decrease in appetite, three
studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=2800"&gt;Examine.com An Amazing Cost-Free Resource with Links to Science Papers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this appetite suppression makes sense, of course, because we
ingest foods to get serotonin. And if we have enough serotonin then
there's no reason to ingest more foods. It tends to have a blunting of
appetite. It probably does that also through other mechanisms. So I'm
not saying you should do this but if someone's trying to blunt their
appetite could be a interesting route, although I don't recommend
chronic use, not surprisingly there's a decrease in body weight as a
consequence, an increase in cortisol. So that's kind of important to
note that when you typically in biology, if you pull on one string
really hard and other one moves it's a little bit like a puppet in
there. It's more than one string on the puppet. So it does seem to
increase cortisol though they report as a minor effect. Again, links
to all those are there which is why I'm not listing them out in our
caption notes. You can go and get them at examine.com, put in
serotonin and you'll find that. So I find it fascinating that nowadays
there are things that are somewhere between doing nothing, getting
serotonin from tryptophan and foods and prescription drugs. There's
this other category of supplements that are really interesting for
modulating these chemicals in the body. And I should mention before I
move on, because I mentioned L-tyrosine I neglected to mention earlier
in our discussion about dopamine, if you're interested in the dopamine
pathway, go to examine.com, put in Mucuna pruriens, it's M-U-C-U-N-A,
separate word, P-R-U-R-I-E-N S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=2885"&gt;Mucuna Pruriens: The Dopamine Bean with a Serotonin Outer Shell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a velvet bean that grows from vines and is very itchy to touch
due to serotonin on its surface. Amazing, this bean has serotonin on
its surface and indeed serotonin at if you were to put it on your skin
would cause some irritation of the skin, amazing. Inside the bean is
L-DOPA, Mucuna pruriens is not just something that promotes dopamine
release because of some weird mystical ancient thing or whatever, or
sorcery. It is chemically L-DOPA the precursor to dopamine. It
contains some other molecules as well and low levels of other
psychoactives. This stuff is available over the counter. Incredible. I
personally find it incredible. Its effects are really interesting. I'm
not gonna read them all off but I mentioned these effects not because
I'm encouraging you to take it but because you get a window into what
dopamine, acute dopamine increase does in the non-Parkinsonian
context. And you can start to think about foods that are rich in
L-tyrosine as biasing certain effects or not others. So when you hear
food is medicine, food isn't really medicine. Food is food, but food
has these chemical effects as well. So first one listed is three
studies with very high rigor that overall have a minor effect on of
all things, sperm quality. So it appears that sperm motility itself,
I'm assuming when they say sperm quality I don't know what features of
sperm of quality they looked at with sperm, that's not discussion I
want to have, but I'm assuming it's motility because I know enough
about reproductive biology to know that sperm ability to swim depends
on some proteins that are present in the front of the sperm, et cetera
things like contractions and sperm motility is generally associated
with sperm quality. Sperm that don't move are generally not very
useful sperm. Symptoms of Parkinson disease are are notably degraded
with Mucuna pruriens. So fascinating. That's not surprising. And there
are a lot of other effects here. Feelings of subjective wellbeing,
testosterone, reductions in prolactin, not surprising. Prolactin is a
hormone that's involved in milk letdown, it's in lactating mothers.
It's involved in feelings of peace and generally is antagonistic to
sexual desire in both men and female. So it's really interesting that
things like Mucuna pruriens which are L-DOPA reduce prolactin,
increased sperm motility, increased testosterone, subjective
wellbeing. So you're starting to see a theme, right? Dopamine really
makes us motivated. Feel in pursuit, makes us feel good. Serotonin
makes us feel more relaxed and calm. Now this whole month is about
emotion. So you might be thinking, well, wait where are we going with
all this as it relates to emotions. But in the last episode I said
something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=3060"&gt;Emotional Context and Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Are Made”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm gonna repeat it now briefly, which is that much of what we talk
about is good emotions or bad emotions. There's a context to that.
There's a social context. We can't really say an emotion is good or
bad. Grieving at a funeral is healthy. Being happy at a funeral,
assuming you loved the person that died is most people probably
wouldn't think that was healthy. So we can't really say that certain
emotions like sadness or happiness are healthy. It's context is
important. Cultural context is important. Many of you have asked for
book recommendations. This is an opportunity to raise a mention of
another book. Again, I don't have any financial affiliation or
anything but if you want to read more about emotions and how the
context and cultural things impact our emotions I'm a huge fan of Lisa
Feldman Barrett. I learned about her from the Lex Fridman Podcast.
I've had discussions with her on my Instagram Live, she's at
Northeastern University, a world expert in emotions. Her first book is
"How Emotions Are Made" This is not a book she sent me. I paid for
this with my own money years ago, bought it, read it, loved it long
before I met Lisa, I'm just delighted that we've got to known each
other a little bit. It's a really interesting read into the psychology
of emotions and some of the subjectivity of emotions. So, whereas I'm
talking about mainly the biology of emotions this gets a little bit
more into the psychology and the biology as well. And Lisa's just
terrific. She's also putting a lot of information out into the world
about emotion. So if you want to learn more about that check out her
work, again, it's Lisa Feldman Barrett. And that book is "How Emotions
Are Made" Hopefully she'll continue to write many more books. So now
you understand the relationship I hope between foods and dopamine,
foods and serotonin and that they're both being communicated to the
brain via the vagus, right? We ingest these foods, these supplements
are things people take, they don't put them directly into the brain.
They put them in our gut. So yes, there's a gut brain connection but
it's not about the serotonin in the gut that makes you feel calm and
placid. It's not about the dopamine in the gut. It's just been
oversold that way because I think there's something really attractive.
And I understand about the idea that because certain things about our
experience of life and our emotions is happening in our body. That
maybe we have a little more control, right? Because this thing is a
hard container. We can't just stuff some dopamine in there. I could
probably take a Mucuna pruriens bean and stuff it in my ear, please
don't do that. It'd make my ear itchy because of the serotonin on the
outside. But you can't get stuff in there. What you have to do is
ingest things that are metabolized in certain ways that communicate to
the brain or so maybe they pass into the brain themselves across
what's called the blood brain barrier. I'll talk about the blood brain
barrier in a minute. It's actually called the BBB. So it ends up
sounding like baby, BBB. I guess that's like BB, anyway, BBB, but
they're also nerves in the gut that are sensing the nutrient contents
of food and then saying, oh, you should feel better and want more. Oh,
that's got a lot of bitterness and acid taste to it. You should want
less of that. So as I transitioned out of the discussion about
dopamine and serotonin in the gut hopefully you've got some actionable
items there under your belt, pun intended, where you can understand
how certain foods and certain nutrients and you can look these up,
might impact your mood. If you're somebody who's really anxious and
really wired. Well, then the dopamine adrenaline pathway epinephrine
pathway is probably not one that you want to lean on any harder. If
you tend to be someone who's pretty passive and you're having trouble
with motivation. Well then think about ramping up the dopamine pathway
through, I always think behaviors and proper food choices is the best
way to start. And behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.
But one of the problems with the discussion around mood and exercise
or mood and meditation is that it's so subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=3295"&gt;Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, But Lacks Specificity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like, I love certain forms of exercise and not others. Certain
ones are aversive to me. Certain ones are attractive to me, and it's
never really clear. No one's ever told me. Okay, you have to do 10
minutes on the bike at X number of RPM at so-and-so or on the skier in
order to get your dopamine up. But we can actually say, if you ingest
more L-tyrosine there's a high probability that you're going to make
more dopamine. And I'm talking about ingesting it through food or
through supplementation if you like. Mucuna pruriens, I've tried. I
should just mention it was too dopaminergic for me. I got really,
really jazzed up and then a severe crash for me the next day. But
that's, I think because I tend to ride pretty high on the kind of
alertness and motivation scale. I'm always being told by Costello and
other people in the podcast studio to slow my speech down. This is me
uncaffeinated, and I could probably afford a little more serotonin in
my life. So, whereas Costello, he can afford to wake up every couple
of days and just say hello to us. This dog sleeps more than any other
creature. It's remarkable. So there are things that we can do and
they're actionable. And they are in some ways they're quantitative
because you can regulate dosages and you can regulate amounts and you
can regulate timing. And everyone has to play with these things and
figure out what's right for them in terms of feeding. And everyone has
to explore and understand what's safe and right for them. But, and of
course, exercise is still very important. I talked about social
connection in the last episode super important for activation of
serotonin but when it comes to this gut brain, body brain
relationship, what we eat really matters in terms of the
neurochemicals that we make. So let's talk a little bit more about
things that we ingest in our body and then allow our body to inform
our brain to shift our mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=3405"&gt;Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil and Alleviating Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is something I've been doing for years. And I just want to
say I've found to be a complete game changer. There's excellent
science to support it. And I think most people are familiar with it in
a different context but I don't think most people know this simple
fact which is that the omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio has a
profound effect on depression. It has a profound effect on mood so
much so that in a double-blind placebo controlled study that I will
provide the link too, this was a study first published in 2008 but
there've been many others as well. First of all, an experiment done in
animals. They found there's a model of learned helplessness in
animals. It's not very kind to the animals, but they put rats or mice
in a jar. They let them swim and they'll swim, swim, swim to try and
save their life. And eventually they give up, it's a learned
helplessness. They don't let them drown, they take them out. Adjusting
the omega-3 omega-6 ratio so that the omega-3's are higher led to less
learned helplessness, meaning these animals would swim longer. Now
that's an animal. That's a rat, not a particularly kind study, but
that same study was essentially done in humans although they didn't
have them swim to the point of near drowning. What they did is they
took people who were clinically depressed, major depression. Major
depression is severe maladaptive state meaning it inhibits job,
relationships, appetite, all sorts of negative health effects. And
they did a comparison of a thousand milligrams a day of EPA. So EPA is
one of the elements that contains high levels of omega-3's that's in
things like fish oil, I'll talk about other sources in a little bit
but it wasn't a thousand milligrams of fish oil. It was a thousand
milligrams of EPA. Compared that to 20 milligrams of Fluoxetine which
is Prozac, okay. Really increases serotonin. And in this study of 60
individuals, again, I'll provide the links to the study. They found
that they were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms. So
imagine that, a food-based compound that you can't make without,
right, this is not a situation where you can make your own omega-3s.
You have to get them from food sources or from supplementation, was as
effective as 20 milligrams of fluoxetine over the course of eight
weeks. And what was really interesting in addition to that is that the
combination of a thousand milligrams of EPA and Fluoxetine had a
synergistic effect in lowering depressive symptoms. I find this
remarkable. I heard about this when it first came out and I wasn't
sure what to make of it. 'Cause there are a lot of studies that come
out and I generally like to focus my changes in behavior around things
where there's a large center of mass. There's a lot of information. A
couple years later, I did in fact start taking a thousand milligrams
per day of EPA in fish oil. Now there are a few side effects of fish
oil. People who have blood, who are bleeders who have Factor V Leiden
mutations or in women who are taking birth control, which can affect
blood clotting and things of that sort really should talk to your
doctor make sure it's okay for you. Fish oil also can give people
fishy breath which is pretty gross, frankly, but there are now fish
oils that either because of the Encapsulations or because they put
some lemon flavoring in there doesn't have that effect. In any event,
a thousand milligrams per day of EPA. I started ingesting that
regularly. I just felt better. I wasn't clinically depressed, but I
generally, I did feel at least for me, an increase in mood and affect.
And a number of other things it's supposed to reduce inflammation. The
cardiovascular effects are controversial for a long time everyone
thought the effects on platelets were really terrific. Then there were
articles that came out in major newspapers saying maybe not so much
but the effects on mood are really profound. And now there are lots of
studies. If you go into PubMed and you were to put EPA or fish oil and
depression&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=3660"&gt;Fish Oil as Antidepressant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you would find that there were a number of really impressive results
showing that it's at least as effective as certain SSRI
antidepressants at these dosages and it can amplify or improve the
effect of low dosages of some of these SSRIs. So I feel like more
people should know about this. This is nutrition, but it's profoundly
affecting mood and depression is terrible, right? Depression can have
a component of anxiety in some cases where people are they feel lousy
and very uncertain. That's kind of how I talk about depression with
anxiety is you talk to someone who is anxious and you can tell them
everything's gonna be okay. And they're always concerned about what
they might not know. You don't really know the plane isn't gonna
crash. You don't really know that life is gonna go okay. And in some
sense, they're right, no one has a crystal ball or can predict the
future, but they tend to perseverate or fixate on the uncertainty. And
then of course there are the versions of depression that involve
certainty. People are lethargic and they're certain they say, yeah,
I'm certain, I'm never gonna get another job. I'm certain, I'm never
gonna meet anyone new. I'm certain I'm gonna fail. So there's this
kind of a divide in the sphere of depression around certainty and
uncertainty. But what's interesting is this thousand milligrams per
day or more of EPA has been shown to relieve both forms of depression.
Now, does that mean it's gonna work for everybody? No, I'm not here to
try and play psychiatrist. I want to point you in the direction of
these manuscripts so that you can make informed choices for yourself.
You can discuss it with your doctor and family and make the choices
that are right for you. But here's what's especially interesting about
the heart effects, because we've heard that these omega-3s, which of
course you can get from other sources too, you can get from fatty
fish, they're in flax seeds, hemp seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=3760"&gt;EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of chia seeds, these kinds of things but the levels
of EPA that are required are quite high. So this thousand milligrams
per day is that's pretty hard to get from food although it can be done
depending on what you're eating. What's interesting is that the heart
effects that are solid that really stand up in the literature have a
lot more to do with something we talked about in a previous episode.
And I'll mention again, which is heart rate variability. So we know
that having a heart rate that's really high or heart rate, that's
really low. Neither of those are good. A lot of people think, oh you
just want a low heart rate, big stroke volume. You know, if you're
running a lot you may have 30 or 40 beats per minute. That's great to
be in shape but you still want heart rate variability. It has a lot to
do with the tone of the autonomic nervous system talked about last
time. How, when you inhale, it speeds up heart rate. When you exhale,
it decreases heart rate. That's called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
That's the basis of heart rate variability. We'll maybe do a short
post about this. So you can get all the mechanism and the behaviors
that spill out of that that might be useful for you. But the point is
heart rate variability. HRV is good. And what's interesting is that
there was a study in 2009 that showed that people who eat a diet where
they fail to supplement in a way that there's a high omega-6 to three
ratio, so not enough omega-3s, not only are there markers of an
inflammatory cytokines, elevated things like IL-6 and TNF-alpha, but
they tend to be non-responders to antidepressants. Shifting that
omega-3 omega-6 ratio did a couple things. First of all, increasing
the amount of EPA shifted the ratio. So it was higher omega-3 to
omega-6 ratio, which was good, lowered the inflammation markers, and
then allowed antidepressants to have their effect, even at low doses.
And here's the really interesting thing. It worked by increasing heart
rate variability, and you think, well, how in the world would this
happen? But you know how I mean, that's a ton of effects but the way
it works is because of the way that these things are impacting the gut
and the autonomic nervous system. Remember earlier, I said, the vagus
includes connections from the heart signaling about sensory
information about how fast the heart is beating to the brain not just
stuff on the lungs, but information from the heart and the brain then
adjusts heart rate by heart rate variability. So it's incredible that
there's a way that one can use the gut, the ingestion of more of these
EPA's, either through food or supplementation to increase rate
variability and thereby to improve symptoms, meaning reduce symptoms
of depression, and to even make low levels of antidepressants that
wouldn't otherwise work work. And I think I like this study so much
because a, it's super cool. It bridges the brain body access. It
incorporates nutrition and micronutrients in the brain but also
because it really points to something that we hear all the time, which
is our body is a whole system. It's working as a whole system and the
brain isn't working in isolation up there in the skull. It's reacting
to things that are happening in the body in the gut and in the heart
rate and heart rate variability. And that the things we ingest can
have a profound effect on them. Now, of course, I really want to
emphasize something which is that no one compound or nutrient or
supplement or drug or behavior for that matter is going to be the be
all end all of shifting out of depression or improving one's mood or
improving sleep. It's a constellation of things. And this is
especially true when people start to get excited about supplements and
drugs of all kinds and their potential for various things. Right now,
there's a lot of excitement about psychedelics and their therapeutic
uses. And I think great, but as a good friend of mine who's a
physician clinician says better living through chemistry still
requires better living. You cannot expect to take a compound
regardless of source or potency and have it completely shift your
experience of life without having to continue to engage in the proper
behaviors, all the things we know proper sleep, exercise, social
connection, food, et cetera. There are many others as well. So I still
find that this collection of studies about omega-3 to omega-6 ratios
to be profoundly important so much so that it's completely changed the
way that I think about food, the foods I eat, I do supplement. I don't
necessarily that think that's for everybody but I really think it's
incredible that there are these compounds that have these robust
effects on our feelings of wellbeing. And there are others too. So
that thousand milligram per day threshold of fish oil that's
beneficial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=4044"&gt;Alternatives to Fish Oil to Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;requires that one take a reasonable amount of these things, either
through food or through supplementation. I acknowledge that not
everyone wants to take fish oil. There are a couple of reasons why one
might want to avoid that. One would be for ethical reasons. You have
an emotional relationship or a relationship to the environment that
makes you not want to ingest fish related products. There's krill oil.
Krill is still an organism. It's a little tiny thing that whales eat a
lot of and people generally eat very little of. So krill is out there,
I personally, just me, I don't know why, I didn't react well to krill.
It didn't make me feel very good. I had some like kind of skin itches
and things like that. And they stopped when I stopped taking it but I
don't want to bias you against it. If that's your preference. Some
people really like krill oil as a source of omega-3s. I did mention
some of the other sources like chia seeds and flax seeds, but as
you'll notice these are not things that we tend to ingest a lot of on
a regular basis. It is possible to get omega-3s from meats. If the
animals have grazed on grasses that contain a lot of omega-3s. So for
those of you that ingest meat you're the source of those meat is gonna
be very important as it relates to omega-3s. Even within the category
of fish oil there's a concern sometimes about mercury and other
contaminants. You want to go with a brand that emphasizes that they've
gone to really good sources and that they decontaminate regardless.
And so you have to search out those brands. There is a test that you
can do as to whether or not the fish oil is a rancid or not. Some
people take it in liquid form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=4145"&gt;L-Carnitine for Mood, Sperm and Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia, Migraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people take in capsule form. The liquid form is gonna be more
affordable. The capsule form is more is a little easier and a little
more portable. You can actually just chew one of the gel tablets. And
if it tastes really fishy kind of rancid, you'll know it's disgusting.
You want to spit it out. And if it doesn't and it's tolerable then
you'll know that that it's okay. Unfortunately you have to buy it
first in order to do that. Although, I don't know, maybe you can get
them to open up the bottle for you in the store and tell them you want
to try it. Someday perhaps fish oil and omega-3, it'll be like tasting
wine at a restaurant where you can send it back for now. I think you
have to purchase it first, but find a brand you trust in like, and
then work with them. If you decide to go that route of course. There
are other compounds that are also interesting for mood elevation that
are essentially like foods or are supplement based that now,
fortunately, there are really good data from peer reviewed studies.
And the next one I want to mention because I think it's really
interesting is L-carnitine. Now, L-carnitine has been around a long
time and it's been discussed in the context of heart health and a
number of other things. It was actually being touted as a bit of a
weight loss agent in the early nineties, but L-carnitine actually has
some really impressive effects on depression. And again, we will look
to PubMed because looking at examine.com is essentially for me anyway
looking at PubMed, what is L-carnitine okay. L-carnitine is most
prevalent in meat and in beef in particular. Now for the vegans,
please know that L-carnitine is available through non-meat sources as
well. Although it's not as enriched in non-meat sources. It's a really
interesting molecule because acetylcarnitine is essentially what's
made from L-carnitine but it's acetylated. If you're interested in the
biochemistry, you can look that up, it's acetylated into a form that
can cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier or BBB is a
barrier. It's a wall around the brain and you have this barrier
because the brain is so important. And it has this feature that the
neurons there don't recreate themselves after injury, like other
organs of the body. There's not a lot of turnover of cells despite
what you might've heard. And so nature has created this BBB, this
blood brain barrier to make sure that certain molecules in particular,
large molecules don't get across the blood-brain barrier. 'Cause it
can be damaging to those tissues. Incidentally, you also have a very
rigid or stringent barrier around other organs, which are the gonads.
So the ovaries and the testes and the brain are the organs of the body
that nature has gone out of its way to protect, give this additional
layer of the blood-brain barrier or as you might imagine for the
testes and the ovaries, it's going to be the blood gonadal barrier. So
these barriers exist to make it such that just because you eat
something, just because you ingest it doesn't mean it's going to cross
the blood-brain barrier, but L-carnitine when taken is acetylated and
converted into this form that gets across the blood-brain barrier. And
it has a lot of effects, it's involved in mitochondrial activation of
long chain fatty acids which that's a big mouthful, that we'll get
into some time when we're talking about metabolic, but it has some
interesting effects on the neuro side. So if you decide to check it
out on examine.com you'll see some really interesting things, lots of
effects on ammonia, C-reactive proteins, things of that sort, blood
glucose is lowered, et cetera. That's all stuff that's the level of
blood and periphery, slight effects in lowering cholesterol. Here's
some interesting ones. Rates of pregnancy go way up when people are
taking L-carnitine both the father and the mother but the source of
sperm and the source of egg are affected in ways that favors
pregnancy. It does increase, here we go again with sperm quality sperm
motility in males and it seems to have positive effects on females
that have polycystic ovary syndrome. So check that out. You know, the
effects are very strong. There are three studies listed there. Again,
I'm not promoting this, but that that people take L-carnitine,
especially if you're trying to get pregnant but check it out because
the effects there and the studies that are mentioned are published in
peer reviewed rigorous journals. In terms of the neural effects. Those
are quite interesting. The effects on depression are still emerging
but they do seem to exist that people feel a notable decrease in
depressive symptoms. There are seven studies listed on examine.com
that it has a notable benefit in a variety of circumstances where
participants have heightened depression already. They start taking
L-carnitine and they start feeling better. And they talk about dosages
in those various studies. It also has been shown to have a notable
decrease in the symptoms of autism, which I find fascinating. Also
again, the things we ingest impact the chemicals in our brain and how
they impact the rest of our body. There's other things that's been
used to treat certain forms of alcohol dependence. I think this is
going to be a very exciting emerging area. We're gonna do a whole
month about addiction. I've got a great guest lined up for that month,
but there's now an emerging field about what people can take and
supplement to help ease the cravings and the withdrawal when trying to
quit drugs of abuse, like cocaine, alcohol, heroin, and smoking and
things of that sort. So really interesting area. This is, I like to
think is the early days and we're gonna discover a lot more. There's a
huge list of things here. Since we talked about pain on a previous
episode and I know a lot of people have written to me about
fibromyalgia. It does L carnitine has been shown to reduce symptoms of
fibromyalgia. Again, all the links to studies are on examine.com,
totally free site. And that was my bulldog being a battering ram.
There's nothing graceful about this bulldog. He's decided he wanted to
leave to go get a drink of water. And so please forgive the noise.
Okay. So now let's turn to another aspect of the gut-brain
relationship that will surprise you, in some cases might shock you.
And that has some really cool and actionable biology. And that's the
gut microbiome, probiotics and prebiotics. I know today we're talking
about emotions and not pain but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
another effect of acetylcarnitine that's been reported and that you
can find listed with link to study on examine.com which is its effect
in reducing the symptoms of migraine. This was a randomized controlled
trial with 133 participants who had frequent migraines. They were
taking 500 milligrams of L-carnitine or nothing for 12 weeks. So the
control is a little bit, the control experiment there is a little bit
tricky but it had a significant effect on reducing the number of
migraine attacks per month. So I find that really interesting and
there's a lot more listed there about the study. And I think these
compounds are powerful. They carry risks for certain people, not for
others. So again, you have to find out what's right for you but I do
think they are super interesting as potential therapeutics for various
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=4589"&gt;Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths &amp;amp; the Tubes Within Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the deal with the gut microbiome and the gut brain axis.
Today we've actually been talking a lot already about the gut brain
axis that has nothing to do with microbiomes. We've been talking about
this vagus nerve that connects providing sensory information from the
body to the brain. And then the brain also sends in the same nerve
motor information to control the motility that got the heart rate how
fast we breathe and deployment of immune stuff killer cells and things
of that sort. But oftentimes when we hear about the gut brain axis
these days, it's a discussion about the gut microbiome. And once
again, we're in a situation where there's incredible biology, I'm very
happy there's so much discussion about the gut microbiome. I am
somewhat dismayed and concerned that most of what I hear out there is
either false or partially false. So we're gonna clear up some of the
misconceptions, first by understanding the biology. And then we're
going to talk about some of the actionable items. It is true that we
have a lot of these little microorganisms living in our gut. They're
not there because they want to help us. They don't have brains, they
are adaptive however, they try and find and create environments that
make it easier for them to proliferate. So they don't care about you
and me but they are perfectly willing to exploit you and me in order
to make more of themselves the same way viruses are, viruses don't
have a mind, they infect cells, they hijack the genome, and they use
that genome to make more of themselves. The microbiota that live in us
vary along the length of our digestive tract. But let's just take a
step back and think about how our body plan is made. We are actually a
series of tubes. Our brain is actually a tube. You see, it's all
squishy on the outside. And then it's got that long thing. The spinal
cord that goes down to the base of the spine. That's the central
nervous system that all started out as a tube. It just looks like a
cauliflower on the other end up in the brain because the tube is so
big and it has to be crammed into the skull. So it gets all wrinkled
up. But if we were to splay it out you'd find that it's just one big
tube. Similarly, our digestive tract and our airways are essentially
one big tube. It starts with our mouth, also our nose. And then we
have all these other tubes. They go down through our throat and then
into our stomach and then into our various intestines. And then the
tube ends out the other end. So we are one long tube for digestion.
And inside of that tube is a mucosal lining. It's these little
microvilli, tiny, tiny, tiny little like velvety ends of cells that
are able to move and move things along and mucus mucosa. And the
conditions of that mucosal lining set a number of different things. It
sets the rate of our digestion and the quality of our digestion. It
sets for instance, our immune system. Most people probably don't
realize this, but most infections in the environment have to get into
our body somehow. Some of them are inhaled. A lot of them go into our
mouth and lodge in the mucosal lining of the mouth. And then infection
start there. You probably had the experience, unfortunately, of you
know, feeling like you have a tick in your throat, like something's
irritating your throat. And then it kind of migrates up into a head
cold or runny nose. Sometimes it'll start as headache. Sometimes it
won't, but things that are inert can migrate down into the gut. So
we're ingesting things all the time. Think about air, bacteria,
viruses, they're making their way into our gut. And some of those
bacteria live in the gut. And some of those bacteria bias the mucosal
lining in the gut, stomach and intestines to be more acidic or more
basic so that they can make more of themselves so they can replicate.
They like a particular comfort. It's like they like a particular kind
of bedding to lie down in and create more of themselves. Now, some of
those those mucosal linings that they promote make us feel better.
They make us feel more alert. They bolster our immune system and
others make us feel worse. So first rule, the microbiome isn't good or
bad. Some of these little bugs that live in us do bad things to us.
They make us feel worse. They lower our immunity. They affect us in
negative ways. Some of them make us feel better and they do that
mainly by changing the conditions of our gut environment. In addition
to that, they do impact the neurotransmitters and the neurons that
live in the gut. And that signal up to the brain to impact things like
dopamine and serotonin that we've been talking about previously. So
there's a vast world now devoted to try and understand what sources of
food what kinds of foods are good or not good for the gut microbiome?
So let's just talk about some general rules of thumb related to the
research quality research that's peer reviewed. And then in a future
episode we will go far deeper into the gut microbiome and gut brain
axis. But here's a few things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=4915"&gt;Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that I think you might find surprising. First of all, supporting a
healthy gut microbiome is good for mood, great for digestion and great
for immune system function. However, that does not mean maxing out or
taking the most probiotic and prebiotic that you can possibly manage.
As I mentioned many times before I do believe in probiotics, I take
probiotics but there are studies that show that if you take lots and
lots of certain probiotics like lactobacillus and you really ramp up
the levels more it is not a case of more is better. There are things
like brain fog that can come from that, brain fog is just this
inability to focus. People feel really not well generally. Some of
those studies are a little bit controversial but I think it's fair to
say that if people really increase the amount of probiotic that
they're taking beyond a certain amount then they start feeling foggy
in the mind. Now what's too much? Well I get probiotics I mentioned
before from Athletic Greens, you can get them from fermented foods
like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto, these are different sources
from around the world. Actually, I'd love to hear some of the other
sources that people know other foods from around the world. I'm
fascinated by the way in which different cultures have all arrived at
these foods that provide and support healthy microbiomes because
they're fermented. I have a colleague at Stanford, Justin Sonnenberg,
and he and I have talked about this. I don't want to quote him
inappropriately, but we've had discussions about it, and they've
published that the ingestion of fermented foods is one of the best
ways to support healthy levels of gut microbiota without exceeding the
threshold that would cause things like brain fog. So foods and
fermented foods are going to be the best source. And there are a
number of different ways that one could do that. Some people don't
like fermented foods, however some people supplement it. So it isn't a
case of more is better. So we know that. The other is that it is true
that healthy gut microbiota have been shown to improve symptoms of
certain psychiatric illnesses as well as certain conditions like
particular features along the autism spectrum, which is interesting.
And those effects are probably due to not just improvement of immune
system function, but to the the conditions in which the neurons that
sense nutrients convey information to the brain and increase levels of
serotonin and or dopamine. So gut microbiome provides kind of a
foundation for healthy gut and healthy gut brain access so much so
that some people report that when they start eating small bits 'cause
it doesn't require a lot of fermented foods, that their overall mood
is better, not unlike the effects of EPA. Although I don't think it's
been looked at directly in the context of clinical depression yet. And
if someone knows of a study please mention it in the comments. That
would be terrific. There are some things that you can do to really
damage your gut microbiome. And this is where there's a huge
misconception that I want to clear up. There was a study that was
published in "Nature", which is among the three top journals that we
have in science. You know, "Nature", "Science" and "Cell" are
considered the top tops, but excellent journal that showed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=5120"&gt;Artificial Sweeteners &amp;amp; the Gut Microbiome: NOT All Bad; It Depends!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that artificial sweeteners but a particular artificial sweetener which
was saccharin can disrupt the gut microbiome in ways that is
detrimental to a number of different health markers, increasing
inflammatory cytokines and all the other bad things that happen when
the gut microbiome is thrown off kilter. That study was widely
discussed but there were a few things that were not mentioned there
that are really important. That study was about saccharin in
particular. Saccharin is not the most typical artificial sweetener
that's used, the most typical artificial sweeteners that are used are
things like aspartame, so-called NutraSweet or Sucralose, or these
days Stevia, there's monk fruits, to my knowledge and please correct
me if anyone knows of any studies, to my knowledge, the negative
effects of these artificial sweeteners on the gut microbiome were
restricted to saccharin. Now there is enough chemical similarity
between saccharin and some of the other ones that I mentioned, but not
all of them. For instance, Stevia, monk fruit are distinct in their
chemical makeup so that they probably don't have if they have any,
have lower effects, negative effects on the gut microbiome, but it
should still be tested. So saccharin is really, it was shown in this
study and several other studies can really negatively impact the
quality of the gut microbiome. Interestingly, the narrative around
artificial sweeteners and gut microbiome is incorrect. Most people
thought, oh, saccharin is bad for the microbiome. It must kill the
microbiome. And so you hear people saying, oh, artificial sweeteners
kill the microbiome. That's not true at all. In fact, in that very
same study published in nature they showed that the negative affects
of saccharin on the microbiome could be blocked or eliminated by
giving antibiotics. So what happens is certain artificial sweeteners
in particular saccharin disrupt the microbiome and make the
environment within the gut that mucosal lining more favorable to
bacteria microbiota that are not good for the organism. This is an
important distinction. It's not just a language thing where people
say, oh, you know, it kills the microbiome. It doesn't kill the
microbiome. It shifts the microbiome and shifts in the microbiome can
be good or they can be bad. And that takes us to another topic that's
a bit of a hot button topic but I'm willing to go there. 'Cause I
think it deserves conversation, which is nowadays there are many
examples out there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=5280"&gt;Ketogenic, Vegan, &amp;amp; Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where people have switched from a kind of standard diet or even a
vegetarian diet to a vegan diet, to a keto diet. Now keto doesn't
necessarily have to mean the ingestion of meats, but it can. And they
experience positive effects for themselves. Not everybody. And I've
talked previously about some of the kind of the incorrect, what I
believe is incorrect marketing of keto as it relates to the cosmetic
effects and some of the challenges with sleep that some people have
but some people love keto and it works great for them. But the
ketogenic diet is interesting because when one shifts to the ketogenic
diet there is a shift in the gut microbiome. And some people end up
feeling better. Some people end up feeling worse. Likewise, some
people go from ingesting animal products including meat or they're
vegetarian and they go to vegan and they experience positive shifts in
mood and affect. And we know that the transition to a more plant-based
diet and especially the enrichment of fiber that's present in those
diets also creates dramatic shifts in the gut microbiome. Some people
feel better doing that. Some people feel worse. And of course, it's
gonna depend on whether or not you're ingesting a lot of processed
foods or not. There was a paper published in "Cell", "Cell Press"
journal obviously, excellent journal, showing that ingestion of
processed foods, regardless of whether or not they come from animal
sources or non-animal sources the processed foods themselves tend to
create activity within the body and this surely has roots in the
nervous system that lead to over-consumption of calories and weight
gain. Even some weight gain that couldn't be explained by increased
calories. In other words, processed foods are bad, regardless of
whether or not you're talking about animal products or non animal
products, probably not surprising given what you know about these
sugar sensing and other amino acid sensing cells in the gut that we
talked about earlier. So the point of all this is that when I say you
have to find what's right for you, that's not a throwaway statement.
Some people's microbiome and the lining of their mucosa, excuse me,
their mucosa lining of their throat, of their gut, of their nose,
everything is improved by diets that are heavily meat based and don't
have many plants. Other people do much better on a plant-based diet
without many meat products or animal products. It's highly individual.
And this probably has roots in genetic makeup. This probably has roots
in what people were raised on because remember the nervous system of
course is set up by your genetic, your genes, your genetic program but
your nervous system adapts early in life to your conditions. That's
what it's for, the reason you have a nervous system is to move your
body appropriately towards things that are good for you and away from
things that are not. But also it was designed to adapt. The early life
period has this incredible thing about plasticity that we spent a
whole month on so that it can change so that yes indeed some people
may like certain foods and react to certain foods better than others
because of the way that their nervous system was wired. This enteric
as it's called nervous system that lines the gut and the communicates
with the brain. So most of what I've talked about today is kind of
black and white. These are things that are present in all of us, the
sugar sensing neurons of the gut, the way the vagus is wired. The fact
that omega-3 omega-6 is tend to improve. The ratios tend to impact
mood with high omega-3. omega-6 ratios improving mood. We talked about
all sorts of things in the gut brain and body brain axis, but when it
comes to the microbiome the key thing is that we all have a
microbiome. You want a microbiome, but you want to promote the
microbiome that is right for you. And that can be shifted and steered
by ingesting certain categories of foods and not others. And one thing
that really frustrates me is when the people show up with an agenda,
like all meat agenda or a vegan agenda or a keto agenda, and they talk
about these positive effects on the gut microbiome. And it's all true,
frankly. And so it's highly individual. Now this doesn't get to any of
the ethical issues around animals or the planet, and you hear rabid
debates about that on both sides. And I am not qualified or equipped
to talk about whether or not regenerative agriculture, animal
products, or farming or any of these things, how those actually impact
the environment, that is not my expertise, but when it comes to your
health and your microbiome you want to support the microbiome. It's
very clear that these fermented foods support the microbiome that we
should be ingesting at least two servings per day. Which is quite a
lot that supplementation at low levels can be good. Supplementation at
high levels can create this brain fog even though some people say that
result is controversial. I've experienced this myself and the data
looked to me pretty darn solid. So that's one thing to think about as
well. And the other thing about the gut microbiome is that it's highly
contextual based on other things that you're doing. So even things
like exercise and social well-being and connection, those things are
also impacting the gut microbiome. So find the diet that's right for
you. And that works for you in the context of the other ethical and
lifestyle choices that are important to you. That's my advice. A note
about fasting. I have a colleague at Yale, who's an expert in the gut
microbiome. And he told me something really interesting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=5600"&gt;Fasting-Based Depletion of Our Microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is when we fast, we actually digest certain components within
our dietary tract. It actually depletes a good amount of the gut
microbiome. And this is interesting. I've had good results from I
guess you would call it intermittent or kind of circadian type fasting
where I've never done long fast, but where I push out my first meal by
a few hours my first meal is generally around lunchtime or so but the
longer periods of fasting that go for a day or two or three days are
known to deplete the gut microbiome in major ways. But that's not
always necessarily a bad thing because when it's replenished, it often
is replenished at levels that exceeded its previous level. But I think
that some of the GI tract and even some of the mental effects of
returning to eating after feeding sometimes people don't feel so good
when they start eating. They really want food, but then they start
eating again. They don't feel as good as they did on the fast. Some of
that may be related to the depletion of the microbiome that occurs
during long fast. So again, this is something to think about and talk
about with your doctor, but the idea that fasting across the board is
good. There may be some merits to that, and certainly in some cases,
but it does deplete the microbiome and that depletion of the
microbiome is significant because it means when you return to eating,
you're actually not in the same position to digest and assimilate
those foods. And those foods are not in the same position to impact
your brain and body the same way they were prior to the fast. And this
is, I think why people suggest a kind of gradual transition back to
consuming nutrients after a fast. So as we round up, I want to share
some results with you That without question will impact the way that
you respond to food mentally and even physically. And I know that
because that's the central theme of the studies I'm about to tell you
about. I have a colleague at Stanford, Alia Crum, who's done some
remarkable experiments on mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=5720"&gt;How Mindset Effects Our Responses to Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some people could think about these as placebo effects or belief
effects, but they actually go way beyond those terms. And there are a
number of different examples of this that Aaliyah's lab and her
coworkers have demonstrated. But two that are particularly interesting
to me I Want to share with you now because they really emphasize how
our beliefs can really impact the way that our brain and body work
together. I think the most famous of these is an experiment they did
where they had two groups of individuals. They were each given a
milkshake and they had some factors measured from their blood by an IV
while they ingested the milkshake. And then afterwards as well. And
one of the factors that they were looking at was something called
grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Grehlin is a peptide that increases with
hunger. So the longer you haven't eaten that grehlin goes up. And I
know some of you say, well, I fast, I fast, I fast and I eventually
lose my appetite. Well, grehlin still goes up and then it drops. So if
you were one of these people that eats every three hours regularly,
grehlin kind of gets a little pulse as you get to that two hour and 50
minute mark. So it's a little bit of a timer as well. It's really
interesting peptide. In any event, what they did is they gave people
milkshakes, two groups, one group got a shake that they were told it
was a low calorie, healthy shake. The other got a milkshake that they
were told it was the very decadent high calorie shake. I think it was
something like two or maybe even two and a half times as many calories
as the other. Perhaps even more, I don't recall the details, but you
got a high calorie and a low calorie condition. And then they drank
the shake and then they measured grehlin in these subjects' blood. And
what they found was that the high calorie shake had a much more robust
effect on blunting grehlin and reducing grehlin. But the interesting
thing you probably guessed already is that it was the exact same shake
given to both groups. So people's belief about the content of
something impacted their physiology. And this speaks to the so-called
top down mechanisms or modulation of our physiology. In a previous
episode about pain we talked about the effects of obsessive believe it
or not, it was an obsessive infatuation and love on pain responses and
pain thresholds. This is yet another example where beliefs or
subjective feelings can impact physiology at the level of the
periphery, because grehlin is released in the periphery in the body.
Now, these beliefs affects extend beyond examples like this, another
good example that I'd like to share is Alia, Dr. Crum, and her
colleagues did an experiment where they took housekeepers, they were
essentially hotel workers, divide them into two groups. They had them
watch a short film. In one case, the film was about how their work was
important to help people feel comfortable in the hotel, et cetera, et
cetera. The other group heard that the activity that they were doing
cleaning and taking care of the hotel was good for them. It was good
for their health, et cetera, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=5910"&gt;How Mindset Controls Our Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They controlled very nicely in the study for health parameters, for
individual differences. And for the behaviors of these people in the
period that followed this short tutorial. And what they found was
eight weeks later, the group that had been told that the activity was
good for them showed lower blood pressure. They had lost a significant
amount of body fat and they reported enjoying their work far more than
the other group. The same work, simply biased mentally by the
information that they were given, but their physiology followed that
information. And so this is not just the placebo effect. This is an
incredible set of findings that illustrate the extent to which whether
or not we believe a food is gonna be good for us or not good for us.
Well, we can't escape the reality. You can't tell yourself that a
poison is gonna be good for you and ingest that poison and expect it
to not kill you, nor can you tell yourself that eating 12 croissants,
I confess I've done it, it was after a very long run, a long time ago
but you can't tell yourself that that's necessarily going to be good
for you or that it's gonna make you lose weight. These belief effects
are not about lying to yourself in these cases, in these experiments
as you'll notice that subjects didn't have prior knowledge about
grehlin or about the effects of their daily routine on weight loss and
blood pressure. So in order for them to work you have to be naive to
the information, right? You can't simply lie to yourself and tell
yourself what you want to believe and that's important, but also
important is that the mind and the body are in this fascinating
interplay. And today we've talked mainly about how the body and things
that we put inside this tube, that runs from our mouth to the other
end to our rectum, basically is impacting all these cells, these
neurons, microbiota in their mucosal lining, heart, lungs and how all
that information is feeding up to the brain to impact how we feel up
here. But also how we feel up here is impacting how our body reacts at
levels of very core physiology that you couldn't just tell yourself
that this was gonna work, but what you believe about certain
substances, certain foods, certain nutrients does have a profound
effect on the magnitude of their impact and sometimes even the quality
and direction of that impact. Well, first of all, I want to thank
everybody for their support of this podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfURDjegrAw&amp;amp;t=6063"&gt;Closing Comments, Thanks, Support &amp;amp; Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response that we've received since releasing at the beginning of
the new year has been tremendous. And we're so grateful for it. I know
some of you and people I've said, well, it's a lot of information.
It's like a college lecture. Indeed, there's a lot of information, but
I believe very strongly that if you learn mechanism and maybe even if
you hear it several times over eventually those mechanisms become
embedded into the way that you view an entire topic. As well, I always
try and put tools as I go along that you can look to immediately. Some
of them might be right for you. Others might not, try them if you like
and don't if you don't want to, and if they don't work for you, then
discard them. If however, you are finding benefits from the
information and from the tools and you know others that you think
could benefit from it, please pass along information about the
podcast. Please subscribe to the YouTube channel if you haven't
already, please subscribe to us on Apple and Spotify, if you haven't
already. Please leave a review in the comment section here on YouTube.
Also, if you feel we deserve it please give us a five-star review on
Apple. All those things really help us. In addition, if you'd like to
support the podcast further we've set up a Patreon account. It's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman. It allows you to support the podcast at a
variety of levels. We have the 5-HTP serotonin for $5 a month, the
Costello, $10 a month in honor of Costello, et cetera. You don't have
to but if you'd like to, that would be terrific. In addition, please
check out our sponsors that we've mentioned at the beginning of the
podcast. That's one of the best ways to help support us. And we do
believe in all the products that we support and our sponsors very much
otherwise we wouldn't be working with them. So much so that when I
mentioned supplements and I talk about supplements throughout the
course of the episodes, I don't mention specific brands, but I would
be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that we have partnered with
Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E. And we've done that because we know that Thorne
uses the highest levels of stringency in terms of the products they
produce. What they say is in each capsule and tablet actually is,
they're used by the Mayo Clinic, by all the major sports teams because
of their level of stringency and rigor. If you want to know what
supplements I take you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman. And you can
see the supplements that I take and you can get those as well as any
of the other supplements and products that Thorne makes for 20% off.
So it's thorne.com/u/huberman to get 20% off any supplements that
Thorne makes. So in today's episode, we took a full journey into the
brain body relationship and discussed a lot of the mechanisms and the
actionable items that you can approach if you want to explore this
aspect of your biology and psychology further. Last, but certainly not
least, I want to thank everybody for your time and attention today,
and as always, thank you for your interest in science. [upbeat music]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew Huberman. And I'm a
Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles
at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools
to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank
the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
InsideTracker analyzes your blood and DNA to give you an accurate
assessment of your health and your biological age. There are many
things about our health that can only be analyzed from blood and DNA
tests. I've been getting my blood assessed for many years now. And
about a year ago, I switched to InsideTracker. What I like about
InsideTracker is that you get all this information back about
metabolic factors, endocrine factors, et cetera, that are really
important to your health. But unlike a lot of blood tests where you
just get all the numbers back and it tells you whether or not things
are high, normal, or low, InsideTracker also has this really useful
and really easy-to-use dashboard that takes the information for your
blood and DNA tests and points you toward particular behavioral,
nutritional, and other sorts of protocols that you can use to get the
numbers where you want them for your health. If you'd like to try
InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman and they will
give you 25% off any of their programs. Again, their programs allow
you to assess your health from the inside, things that you could just
never assess from any kind of test that didn't involve blood and DNA.
And it also has this really interesting feature that it can measure
your inner age, which is based on biology. Your chronological age, of
course, is very informative about your health and where you ought to
be in terms of health metrics, but people vary. We know people, of
course, that are in their late 90s who are doing well. We know people
that are in their 50s who are struggling or even in their 20s. So,
blood and DNA are the way to analyze your health. That's my belief.
That's why I use InsideTracker. So, go to insidetracker.com/huberman
to get 25% off any of their products and use "Huberman" at checkout.
Our second sponsor of today's episode is Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep
makes mattresses and pillows that are ideally suited to your needs for
the best night's sleep possible. I switched to using a Helix mattress
and Helix pillow this last year and I'm sleeping better than I ever
have before. The way that Helix mattresses work and the reason they're
different, is that they are tailored to your individual sleep style.
Your sleep style can be assessed by going to their website, you take a
brief two-minute questionnaire quiz. Asks you questions like, do you
sleep on your back or your side or your stomach? Maybe you don't know
or maybe you move around a lot during the night. It also asks you
questions such as do you tend to run hot or wake up cold, things of
that sort. And then they tailor a particular mattress to your sleep
needs. For me, I matched to the so-called Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress. And
I love it. I sleep better than ever. And right now, if you want to try
Helix Sleep you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman. And if you do that,
you'll get $200 off your order plus two free pillows. They also have a

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=281"&gt;Emotions: A Logical Framework of Brain-Body Loops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's episode is going to be all about the science of emotions. The
first month of the podcast, we talked about sleep and wakefulness.
Last month, we were talking about neuroplasticity, the brain's ability
to change in response to experience. And this month we're going to
talk about these things that we call emotions. We're going to decipher
what they are, how they work, how we can control them when we might
not want to control them. There are going to be four episodes on
emotions. And today, we're going to talk in particular about something
that most often is called stress. Now, you might be thinking, "Wait,
stress isn't an emotion." But stress really lies at the heart of
whether or not our internal experience is matched well or not to our
external experience where the events that are happening to us and
around us. And as you'll soon, see those converge or combine to create
what we call emotions. Now, I want to be very clear that we're going
to talk about the biology of emotions, we're going to talk a little
bit about some psychological concepts related to emotion, and we are
definitely going to talk about tools to control what we call stress or
commonly think of as stress. We're also going to clean up some common
myths about stress. For instance, that stress impairs your immune
system. That's true in certain contexts. And in other contexts, stress
actually enhances your immune system and makes it function better.
There is going to be a lot of discussion about whether or not our
internal state, whether or not we are alert or calm is good or bad,
depending on the circumstances. So, where we're headed here is I'd
like you to come away from today's episode with what I call an
organizational logic, a framework for thinking about these things that
typically we just call happy or sad or depressed or anxious. And I'm
going to make sure that you have tools that are grounded in physiology
and neuroscience that will allow you to navigate this otherwise
complex space that we call emotions that will allow you to ground
yourself better when you're feeling like life is weighing on you,
where you're kind of being pulled by the currents of life as well as
to support other people whether or not that's in a psychological
practice if you're a practitioner, or you have clients or children or
spouses, really, to be able to support other people in your
environment better. And the tools that I'm going to focus on today
range from behavioral tools. We will talk about some of the more
valuable supplementation tools that are out there. And we're going to
talk a little bit about things like depression, PTSD, but we will be
devoting entire episodes to things like depression, PTSD, and even
attention deficit and obsessive compulsive disorder, which believe it
or not, although this might not surprise many of you, have a very
strong emotional component. It's just not just about compulsive
behaviors and intrusive thoughts. It's also about the emotional load
of being in that state. So, I promise that today we're going to clean
up a lot of misunderstanding. We're going to give you a lot of tools
and you're going to learn a lot about the biology of how your body and
brain work together. Because if ever there was a topic that brought
together the brain and body or mind-body relationship, it's stress and
emotions. It's also the positive emotions. When we feel something,
whether or not we're super happy or just feeling kind of pleasant or
we are feeling stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed, it isn't just in
our head. It's also in our body. And as you may recall, the nervous
system, which includes the brain and the eyes and the spinal cord, but
also all the connections with the organs of the body includes the
brain and body. And those organs of the body, your gut, and your
liver, and your spleen, they're also communicating with the brain. So,
I look forward to a day, in fact, when we no longer think about
neuroscience as just the brain. And many neuroscientists now also
think about the body, of course. And the brain controls the body, but
the body is also having a very profound and concrete influence on the
brain. I think up until recently, people would hear about kind of
brain-body and always think about mindfulness. We're actually not
going to talk that much about mindfulness at all today. Mindfulness is
kind of a vague concept, in fact. When you think about mindfulness,
it's good to take the opposite. What's the opposite of mindfulness?
Would be mindlessness. Well, all of a sudden we're into territory that
isn't really easy for one person to describe their experience or to
help others with their experience. Today, we're going to talk about
objective tools that match the brain-body experience or separate the
brain-body experience in ways that leverage your ability to lean into
life better, to feel better, literally to just feel better about what
you're experiencing, and believe it or not, to be able to control your
emotions when that's appropriate. This isn't about becoming robotic.
This isn't about trying not to feel human. This is actually about
being able to lean into life better as a consequence of being able to
control some of your inner real estate. This nervous system that
includes the brain and body and how that nervous system is interacting
with the outside world. So, it's to place you in a greater position of
power. And so, let's get started in deciphering what is stress, what
are emotions, and why did I batch stress and emotions into one
discussion today? Okay. So, what is stress? We hear all the time that
stress is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=629"&gt;Stress: The (Falsely Narrow) Animal Attack Narrative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear people saying they're really stressed out. What is stress?
You've all presumably heard the arguments or the framework that stress
is this horrible ancient carryover over from times in which humans
were pursued by animals or other human predators and that whenever we
feel what we call stress or feel stressed out, that it's just this
unfortunate invasion of something that we no longer need in modern
life, that this was designed for when we were being attacked by bears
or tigers or lions or whatever it is. And gosh, what an unfortunate
thing. And we have so many creature comforts nowadays, but we have not
eliminated this stress. Almost as if it was like an organ or a system
in our body that was bad for us, that we're stuck with just because of
the species that we are. But first of all, all species experience
stress. And I think that it's fair to say even though I wasn't there,
that yes, in fact, throughout our evolutionary history, we were
vulnerable to animal attack and other human attacks on a regular basis
up until a point where we started developing weapons and structures
and fire and other things that allow us to protect ourselves better
from those animals and invaders of various kinds. But it is entirely
naive for us to think that in ancient times, ancient times being kind
of loose term for previous on medieval times, 100 years ago, 1000
years ago, 10,000 years ago, of course, there were infidelities,
right? Partners cheated. People died. In fact, before the advent of
phones, which we're going to talk about today, you can imagine that
someone might head off on a hunt or to go visit a relative and never
come back and you would never know why. That would be very stressful.
So, there was psychosocial stress. There was the stress of losing
loved ones. There was the stress of cold, of famine. There was the
stress probably also of just worry. This idea that ancient versions of
humans 1000 years ago, 100 years ago didn't worry, I think that is
entirely inconsistent with everything we know about the structure of
the human brain 100 years, 1000 years ago. So, all the problems that
we're struggling with existed forever. It's just that stress at its
core is a generalized system. It wasn't designed for tigers attacking
us or people attacking us. It's a system to mobilize other systems in
the brain and body. That's what stress really is. It's designed to be
generic. And that's the most important thing that I'd like you to
understand today, is that the system that governs what we call stress
is generic. It wasn't designed for one thing. And that gives it a
certain advantage in taking over the state of our brain and body, but
it also gives you, all of us an advantage in controlling it because
it's based on hard-wired biological mechanisms and there are hard-
wired biological mechanisms, meaning cells and chemicals and pathways
and tissues that exist in you right now that require no
neuroplasticity that allow you to put a brake on stress. And so, we're
going to talk about those. So, you have a system for stress and you
have a system for distress that are baked into you. They were
genetically encoded. And you were born with them and you still have
them now. So, if you're alive and listening, you have the capacity to
control your stress. And today, I'm going to talk about ways that you
can control your stress, not just by doing some offline practice of
meditation or breath work or something like that, but real-time tools.
Tools that allow you to push back on stress when stress hits in real
time. This is something that my lab works actively on in developing
and testing these tools and evolving these tools. And there are other
laboratories that do this as well. So, let's talk about the stress
response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=871"&gt;The Stress RESPONSE: Generic, Channels blood, Biases Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by doing that, you will understand exactly why the tools I'm going
to give you work. For those of you that are saying, "Wait, I just want
the tools. Just give me a summary," trust me, if you understand
mechanism, you are going to be in a far better position to incorporate
these tools, to teach these tools to others, and to modify them as
your life circumstances change. If you'd like the cheat sheet or you
just want the one-page PDF, eventually we'll get that stuff out to
people, but it's really important to understand the underlying
mechanism. Okay. So, what is stress? Well, let's just distinguish
between stressors, which are the things that stress us out, and
stress, which is the psychological and physiological response to
stressors. I'm mainly going to talk about stress, which is your
response to things. Let's be clear about what we already know, which
is that stressors can be psychological or they can be physical. Okay?
If I put you outside on a cold day without a jacket for a very long
time, that is stressful. If I have you prepare for too many exams at
once and you can't balance it all with your sleep schedule and your
other needs for comfort and wellbeing, like food, rest, sleep, and
social connection, that is stressful. So, stress, and as I mentioned
before, is generic. It doesn't distinguish between physical and
emotional stress. So, what happens when the stress response hits?
Let's talk about the immediate or what we call the acute stress
response. We could also think of this as short-term stress. So, you
have a collection of neurons. They have a name. It's called the
sympathetic chain ganglia. And it has nothing to do with sympathy.
Sympa means together. And there's a group of neurons that start right
about at your neck and run down to about your navel, a little bit
lower, and those are called the sympathetic chain ganglia. You don't
need to memorize that name. There will not be a quiz. But it's
important to know that in the middle of your body, you have a chain of
neurons that when something stresses us out, either in our mind or
because something enters our environment and we see something that
stresses us out, that we don't like heights if you're afraid of
heights, somebody you dislike walks into the room, et cetera, that
chain of neurons becomes activated like a bunch of dominoes falling on
all at once. It's very fast. When that happens, those neurons release
a neuromodulator neurochemical that I've talked about before on this
podcast called acetylcholine. They release that at various sites
within the body. Now, this is important because normally,
acetylcholine would be used to move muscles. Actually, every time we
move a muscle, pick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen, walk down
the street, it's spinal neurons connecting to muscle and releasing
acetylcholine. So, in the brain it's involved in focus and it muscles
is involved in making muscles twitch. But if we were stressed, we
wouldn't want all our muscles to contract at once because we would
just be kind of like paralyzed like this in what tonic activation, as
it's called. We wouldn't want that. Something called tetanus, believe
it or not. because the tetanus toxin will cause that kind of rigor of
the entire body. You do not want that. When those neurons are
activated, acetylcholine is released, but there are some other neurons
for the aficionados out there. They're called the postganglionic
neurons. Those ones respond to that acetylcholine and then they
release epinephrine, which is the equivalent to adrenaline. So, we
have this system where it's very fast whenever we're stressed, the
core of our body, these neurons down the middle of our body release
these chemicals and then there's adrenaline or epinephrine released at
particular organs and acts in particular ways. We're going down into
the weeds here. So just stay with me because it's going to make a lot
of sense and you will appreciate having this knowledge in hand. That
epinephrine acts in two different ways. Some things like the muscles
of your legs and your heart and other things that need to be active
when you're stressed, they have a certain kind of receptor which is
called the beta receptor. And that beta receptor responds to
epinephrine and blood vessels dilate. They get bigger and blood rushes
in to our legs. The heart rate speeds up. Lots of things happen that
get activated. And at the same time, that epinephrine activates other
receptors on certain tissues that we don't need. The ones involved in
digestion, reproduction, and things of that sort that are luxuries for
when things are going well, not things to pay attention to when we're
stressed. And that binds to other receptors that contract the blood
vessels. So, basically the stress response, this is the key phrase
here, the stress response A, is generic, I said that before, and B, it
basically pushes certain systems to be activated and other systems to
not be activated. So, the stress response is two-pronged. It's a yes
for certain things and it's a no, you may not right now for other
things. So, that's the key thing to understand about the stress
response. That's why your heart speeds up. That's why you feel blood
in certain organs and tissues of your body, but not in others. That's
why your throat goes dry because it turns out that when you get
stressed, the salivary glands are shut down. There's a lot less blood
flow to the neurons that control salivation. And so, you're going to
start swallowing. You feel like your throat is getting dry. There are
a lot of different effects. I'm not going to list them all off, but
basically, you are activated in ways that support you moving. So,
that's the third thing. It's first of all, it's generic. Second of
all, the stress response, activate certain things and shuts down other
features of our body. And then it's a sense of agitation that makes
you want to move. And that's because fundamentally, the stress
response is just this generic thing that says do something. And
movement in this case can either be the bias to move in terms of
action, or it can be the bias to say something. When we are stressed,
we are more likely to say something that probably we shouldn't say. We
are more likely to move. And if you're trying to suppress movement,
you'll feel that as a tremor. You're going to feel agitated and that's
because it was designed to move you. So, this is important because if
you want to control stress, you need to learn how to work with that
agitation. I'd like to give you a tool at this point, because I think
if we go any further&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=1268"&gt;Tools to Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness or Increase Calm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with a lot more science, people are going to begin to wonder if this
is just going to be a kind of standard university lecture about the
stress response. I'm going to give you more signs about the stress
response, but I want to take what we now already know about the stress
response and use that as a framework for thinking about how one might
reduce or even eliminate the stress response quickly in real time,
should it arise when we don't want it. So, we're taking the podium or
we're sitting down at a Zoom call, and all of a sudden we're feeling
flushed. We're feeling like our heart is racing. We're feeling a
little too alert. We're feeling a little worked up and we want to calm
down. As far as I am aware of, the best tools to reduce stress
quickly, so-called real-time tools are going to be tools that have a
direct line to the so-called autonomic nervous system. The autonomic
nervous system is a name given to the kind of general features of
alertness or calmness in the body. Typically, it means automatic.
Although we do have some control over it at certain what so-called
leavers are entry points. Here's what doesn't work to control stress.
Telling yourself to calm down. In fact, that tends to just exacerbate
stress. Telling someone else to calm down also tends to exacerbate
their stress. If you want to reduce the magnitude of the stress
response, the best thing you can do is activate the other system in
the body which is designed for calming and relaxation. And that system
is called the parasympathetic nervous system. Because as I mentioned
before, the neurons that control stress run from about your neck to
your navel. The parasympathetic neurons, para just means near, exist
in, they're some of the cranial nerves. So, it's kind of left neck and
lower brainstem. Kind of back of the brain and in the neck and in the
pelvic area. And the parasympathetic nervous system is really
interesting because especially the cranial nerves, the ones that are
up in the brainstem and in the neck area, those have a direct line to
various features of your face, in particular, the eyes. They control
things like eye movements, pupil dilation, things of that sort, as
well as the tongue, the facial muscles, et cetera. The parasympathetic
nervous system, many people don't realize this, is the system by which
we control the face and the eyes, and to some extent, our airway, the
trachea. And it's these neurons that reside within the pelvic area.
Now, the neurons within the pelvic area are involved in control of the
genitals, the bladder, and the rectum. And those don't have a direct
line. You don't have a direct way to control those. It actually has to
go from brain to spinal cord and then out to those organs. Whereas the
parasympathetic nervous system has certain entry points or what I'll
call leavers that will allow you to push back on the stress response
in real time and diminish it and feel more relaxed really quickly. So,
I'm going to teach you the first tool now, so I don't overwhelm you
with all this academic knowledge without giving you something useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=1455"&gt;The Fastest Way to Reduce Stress In Real Time: “Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the tool that at least to my knowledge is the fastest and most
thoroughly grounded in physiology and neuroscience for calming down in
a self-directed way is what's called the physiological sigh, S-I-G-H.
Now, some of you might've heard me talk about this on previous
podcasts, but I'm going to explain this in the context of how
respiration in general is used to calm us down. And turns out you're
all doing this all the time, but you are doing it involuntarily. And
when you stress, you tend to forget that you can also activate these
systems voluntarily. This is an extremely powerful set of techniques
that we know from scientific studies that are being done in my lab,
Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA, and others now that are very, very useful
for reducing your stress response in real time. And here's how they
work. These days, there seems to be a lot of interest in breath work.
Breath work typically, is when you go and you sit down or you lie down
and you deliberately breathe in a particular way for a series of
minutes in order to shift your physiology, access some states. And it
does have some utility that we're going to talk about, that is not
what I'm talking about now. What I'm talking about when I refer to
physiological sighs, is the very real medical school textbook
relationship between the brain, the body, and the body as it relates
to the breathing apparati, meaning the diaphragm and lungs and the
heart. Let's take the hallmark of the stress response. The heart
starts beating faster. Blood is shuttled to the big muscles of the
body to move you away from whatever it is the stressor is or just make
you feel like you need to move or talk. Your face goes flushed, et
cetera. Heart rate, many of us feel is involuntary. Just kind of
functions whether or not we're moving fast or moving slow. If you
think about it, it's not really purely autonomic because you can speed
up your heart rate by running or you can slow it down by slowing down
your run. You can move to a walk or lie down. But that's indirect
control. There is however, a way in which you can breathe that
directly controls your heart rate through the interactions between the
sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system. Here's how it
works. When you inhale, so whether or not it's through the nose or
through the mouth, this skeletal muscle that's inside your body called
the diaphragm, it moves down. And that's because the lungs expand, the
diaphragm moves down. Your heart actually gets a little bit bigger in
that expanded space. There's more space for the heart. So, not your
emotional heart getting bigger. I'm talking about your actual physical
heart getting a little bit bigger. The volume grows. And as a
consequence, whatever blood is in there is now at a lower volume or
moving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume than it was
before you inhaled. Okay? So more space, heart gets bigger. Blood
moves more slowly. And there's a little group of neurons called the
sinoatrial node in the heart that registers, believe it or not, those
neurons pay attention to the rate of blood flow through the heart and
send a signal up to the brain that blood is moving more slowly through
the heart. The brain then sends a signal back to the heart to speed
the heart up. So, what this means is if you want your heart to beat
faster, inhale longer, inhale more vigorously than your exhales. Now,
there are a variety of ways that one could do that, but it doesn't
matter if it's through the nose or through the mouth. If your inhales
are longer than your exhales, you're speeding up your heart. If your
inhales are more vigorous, so even if your inhales are shorter than
your exhales, you are speeding up your heart rate. Now, the opposite
is also true. If you want to slow your heart rate down, so stress
response hits, you want to slow your heart rate down, what you want to
do is again, capitalize on this relationship between the body, meaning
the diaphragm and the heart and the brain. Here's how it works. When
you exhale, the diaphragm moves up, which makes the heart a little bit
smaller. It actually gets a little more compact. Blood flows more
quickly through that compact space sort of like just a pipe getting
smaller. The sinoatrial node registers that blood is going more
quickly, sends a signal up to the brain. And the parasympathetic
nervous system, some neurons in your brain stem send a signal back to
the heart to slow the heart down. So, if you want to calm down
quickly, you need to make your exhales longer and or more vigorous
than your inhales. Now, the reason this is so attractive as a tool for
controlling stress is that it works in real time. This doesn't involve
a practice that you have to go and sit there and do anything separate
from life. And we are going to get to emotion. Emotions and stress
happen in real time. And so, while it's wonderful to have a breath
work practice or to have the opportunity to get a massage or sit in a
sauna or do whatever it is that you do in order to set your stress
controls in the right direction, having tools that you can reach to in
real time that require no learning, I mean, I had to teach it to you,
you had to learn that, but it doesn't require any plasticy to activate
these pathways. So, if you're feeling stressed, you still need to
inhale, of course, but you need to lengthen your exhales. Now, there's
a tool that capitalizes on this in a kind of unique way, a kind of a
twist, which is the physiological sigh. The physiological sigh was
discovered in the '30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=1785"&gt;The Fastlane to Calm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's now been explored at the neuro-biological level and
mechanistically in far more detail by Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA. Also
Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford. And the physiological sigh is
something that humans and animals do anytime they are about to fall
asleep. You also do it throughout sleep from time to time when carbon
dioxide, which we'll talk about in a moment, builds up too much in
your system. And the physiological sigh is something that people
naturally start doing when they've been crying and they're trying to
recover some air or calm down when they've been sobbing very hard or
when they are in claustrophobic environments. However, the amazing
thing about this thing that we call the diaphragm, the skeletal
muscle, is that it's an internal organ that you can control
voluntarily, unlike your spleen or your heart or your pancreas where
you can't just say, "Oh, I want to make my pancreas turn out a little
more insulin right now. I'm just going to do that with my mind
directly." You can't do that. You can do that by smelling a really
good donut or something, but you can't just do it directly. You can
move your diaphragm intentionally, right? You can do it anytime you
want. And it'll run in the background if you're not thinking about it.
So, this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm through
what's called the phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. The phrenic
nerve innervates the diaphragm. You can control anytime you want. You
can double up your inhales or triple up your inhales. You can exhale
more than your inhales. Whatever you want to do. Such an incredible
organ. And the physiological sigh is something that we do
spontaneously. But when you're feeling stressed, you can do a double
inhale, [inhales deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, I just told you a
minute ago that if you inhale more than you exhale, you're going to
speed the heart rate up, which would promote more stress and
activation. Now I'm telling you to do a double inhale-exhale in order
to calm down. And the reason is the double inhale-exhale which is the
physiological sigh takes advantage of the fact that when we do a
double inhale, even if the second inhale is sneaking in just a tiny
bit more air, because it's kind of hard to get to deep inhales back to
back, you do big deep inhale and then another little ones sneaking it
in, the little sacks in your lungs. If you only have the lungs. Your
lungs are just two big bags, but you've got millions of little sacks
throughout the lungs that actually make the surface area of your lungs
as big as a tennis court. It's amazing if we were to just spread out.
Those tend to collapse as we get stressed. And carbon dioxide builds
up in our bloodstream and that's one of the reasons we feel agitated
as well. So, and it makes us very jittery. I mean, there's some other
effects of carbon dioxide I don't want to get into, but when you do
the double inhale-exhale, the double inhale reinflates those little
sacks of the lungs. And then when you do the long exhale, that long
exhale is now much more effective at reading your body and bloodstream
of carbon dioxide, which relaxes you very quickly. My lab in
collaboration with David Spiegel's lab, David's the Associate Chair of
Psychiatry at Stanford, are doing a study right now exploring how
physiological sighs and other patterns of breathing done deliberately
can modulate the stress response and other things related to
emotionality. Those work are ongoing. I want to be clear those studies
aren't done. But it's very clear from work in our labs, from work in
Jack Feldman's lab and others, that the physiological sigh is the
fastest, hardwired way for us to eliminate this stressful response in
our body quickly in real time. And so, I'm excited to give you this
tool because I think most people have heard that mindfulness and
meditation is good, exercise is good for us, we all need to be getting
enough sleep, et cetera, but life happens. And when you find yourself
in a position where you are more alert and activated than you would
like to be, regardless of whether or not the stressor is relationship-
based or it's financial or it's physical or anything like that, you
can look to the physiological sigh because it bypasses a very
important feature of how we function, which is that it's very hard to
control the mind with the mind, especially when we are in heightened
states of activation. When you're very alert or very sleepy, it is
very hard to use these so-called top-down mechanisms of intention and
gratitude and all these things that are really powerful tools when we
are not super activated and stressed or not super tired. But when we
are anywhere in the range of very alert and stressed to very sleepy,
physiological sighs are a powerful way of bringing our level of so-
called autonomic activation, which just means our level of alertness
down. And so, whether or not it's in line at the bank or whether or
not you're wearing a mask nowadays or you're not, whatever the
conditions may be where you're at and your needs, when you're feeling
stressed, the physiological sigh done just one to three times, it will
be double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times
will bring down your level of stress very, very fast. And as far as I
know, it's the fastest way to accomplish that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2093"&gt;Important Notes About Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important note about the physiological sigh or exhale-emphasized
breathing for lowering the stress response. Many people worry that
their heart rate does not come down fast enough. I want to tell you
you do not want your heart rate to reduce very fast. There's actually
something called the vasovagal response, where people will stand up or
they'll get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and then
all of a sudden, they'll collapse, they'll faint. That's because the
heart rate was reduced too much. Some people will see blood or they'll
see something really troubling and stressful and they'll pass out.
That's an over-activation or an acceleration of the calming response.
They're not so stressed that they kind of fall off the cliff of
stress. They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism for calming
themselves down goes too high, too fast. They calmed down too fast and
they collapse and faint. And so, be aware that if you're going to use
the physiological sigh or exhale-emphasized breathing to calm down,
that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 seconds to come down to
baseline. And you may need to repeat the physiological sigh a few
times. So, that's an important note about the use of breathing to
control levels of stress. The other thing is that when you decide to
look to the body to control the mind, it does something else that's
very powerful. When you are stressed in your mind and body, so you're
feeling really agitated, activated, and worried, and you use a tool
like the physiological sigh or exhale-emphasized breathing, you will
notice that then your brain and your mind becomes more available for
controlling the stress response and reacting to it. Which is great
because the sweet spot in life is to be, provided you're not trying to
sleep, is to be alert and calm. And so, that's the idea. Is to be
alert and calm and to bring you back into that sort of plane of
alertness. For those of you that have trouble sleeping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2210"&gt;Cyclic Sighing For Calm and Sleep Induction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or just relaxing through the day, the physiological sigh can be
repeated for 10, 15 cycles if you like. Some people find that it
actually puts them to sleep. So, if they lie down and they're reading
and they do too many of these, that actually can put them to sleep.
And what you'll find is that most breath work protocols, the kind of
stuff that's done away from real life, that you set aside time and
decide to do quote unquote, breath work, most of that works such that
if you're doing inhales that are longer and more vigorous than
exhales, it tends to be activating and alert you. If you're doing
exhales that are longer and more vigorous than the inhales, it tends
to put you to sleep. And many of the protocols that are out there from
laboratories and that populate the internet and wellness sites and
whatnot, if it's exhale-emphasized breathing, oftentimes has been used
as a tool for trying to teach people to fall asleep. Physiological
sigh is a little different. It's designed to be used in real time.
Just think of it is just kind of in your kit of things that you can do
as life happens and as you need to react to life. A note about nasal
versus mouth breathing, there's a plethora of information out there
now because of James Nestor's book, "Breath: The New Science of a Lost
Art," which came out this last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2277"&gt;Nasal Breathing For Cosmetic, Immune and Performance Enhancement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent book. As well as "Jaws" which is from Sandra Kahn, Paul
Ehrlich with a foreword by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky. So, a
collection of people from Stanford. Jared Diamond is not at Stanford,
but the rest are. And some heavy hitters on that book, which is about
the benefits of nasal breathing. And in many cases, nasal breathing is
more advantageous than mouth breathing for all sorts of things.
Cosmetic features of the face, especially in kids, warding off
infection, et cetera. With the physiological sigh, the best way to do
it would be double inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.
But if you can't, and you can only do that through your mouth, just do
it through your mouth. If want to do all through your nose, do it
through your nose. This anchors back to some underlying neurology or
neuroscience. So, for those of you that want to know, you have two
breathing centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2326"&gt;Two Breathing Centers In The Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that's involved in rhythmic breathing for inhales followed by
exhales, followed by inhales followed by exhales. The so-called pre-
Botzinger nucleus named after a bottle of wine and discovered by Jack
Feldman at UCLA and a nearby nucleus called the parafacial nucleus
also discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA. And the parafacial nucleus is
involved in any time you double up the inhales or double up the
exhales. It was designed so that you could breathe while you're
speaking because you can't always go inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
when you're speaking. So, I tell you this, not to overwhelm you with
knowledge, but just know that when you double up your inhales or you
double up your exhales, you are activating this parafacial nucleus.
And it has other cool effects. Because it's located near the neurons
that control the face, it also has a tendency to relax the jaw.
There's some interplay between the neurons that control the speaking
stuff and the stuff for your tongue. So, all of a sudden, when we do
this physiological sigh, we tap into neural circuitry that allows us
to speak more clearly, to control the muscles of the face and jaw.
Maybe that means not saying certain things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2385"&gt;Breathing For Speaking Clearly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we're stressed, and just generally to relax. And so, this brings
us back to the neuroscience of this parasympathetic nervous system.
This calming system that's been genetically encoded into us that we
all have, regardless of who our parents are, which is that the neurons
that control all this stuff, the face, the eyes, et cetera, are all
working together. And that's why when we get stressed, it's hard for
us to speak or we tend to jitter and these kinds of things. Just like
all the neurons that cause stress in the center of the spinal cord are
working together to get our body activated. Okay, lot of science
today. You've now got the physiological sigh as a tool. You know the
exhale-emphasized breathing will slow your heart down and inhale-
emphasized breathing will speed your heart up. So, let's think about
something now. Let's think about stress from not whether or not it's
acute or chronic, whether or not it's good for us or bad for us, but
on three different timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2439"&gt;The 3 Types of Stress: Short, Medium and Long-Term&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because then we can arrive at what this is all about as it relates to
emotions. Because trust me, this has everything to do with emotions
and whether or not you're functioning well emotionally or you're not
functioning well emotionally, whether or not you're coping or not
coping. So, those are typically psychological terms and psychological
discussions. We are entering this through the portal of physiology.
The stuff of medical textbooks. And we will arrive at the psychology
soon, but I really want you to understand the difference between the
three kinds of stress on three different timescales, short-term,
medium-term, and long-term, and what it's good for and what it's bad
for. I think we've all heard that stress is bad for us. We've seen
these pictures intended to frighten us. And indeed they are
frightening. You see the nice really plump brain on the left. It says
healthy or control. And then you see the brain that says stressed
above it on the right and it's like withered, where we see that the
hippocampus and area involved in memory is smaller. People that are
stressed. We see that the Alzheimer's brain is made worse by stress.
That people who have a predisposition to schizophrenia, when they get
stressed, higher incidence of schizophrenia episodes. You hear that
addicts will relapse when they're stressed. I mean, okay, we get it.
And it's very important, but I think we've all heard now so many times
that stress is bad. But in that conversation, unfortunately, it's
eclipsed some of the really positive things that stress does for us in
the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2530"&gt;Positive Effects of Short-Term Stress: Immunity and Focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, stress can be short-term, medium-term, or long-term. Long-term
stress is indeed bad for all the reasons I just mentioned and many
others. But what's never actually been discussed is what stress is so
terrific for, positive for in the short-term. And I think we tend to
overlook the important question, which is what is short-term and what
is long-term? No one ever bothers to tell us what is chronic, what is
acute. Right? Is it five minutes? Is it five days? Is it for the
duration of final exams? Or is it for the duration of a senior thesis
in college? No one actually draws boundaries around this stuff or even
general guidelines. And so, it's become a bit of a mess, frankly, to
try and decipher this whole space around stress. So, I'm going to try
and clean some of this up for you based on what we know from the
scientific data. First of all, acute stress, when the stress response
hits, that is good for your immune system. I know that might be a
tough pill to swallow, but it's absolutely true. In fact, stress often
comes in the form of bacterial or viral infection. And the stress
response is in part organized to combat bacterial and viral infection.
There are pathways from the same brain centers that activate these
neurons in your spinal cord to make you feel like you want to move.
There are other neurons in your brain that activate things like your
spleen, which will deploy killer cells to go out and scavenge for
incoming bacteria and viruses and try and eat them up and kill them.
So, short-term stress and the release of adrenaline in particular or
epinephrine, same thing, adrenaline and epinephrine, is good for
combating infection. And this to me is just not discussed enough. So,
that's why I'm discussing it here. And it relates to a particular tool
that many of you ask about, but I don't often get the opportunity to
talk about in such an appropriate context. It's not that it's ever
inappropriate to talk about, but what I'm about to talk about now is
the use of, again, respiration breathing to somewhat artificially
activate the stress response. And that will accomplish two things.
Okay? I'll return to medium and long-term stress, but I want to say
short-term stress is good because the dilation of the pupils, the
changes in the optics of the eyes, the quickening of the heart rate,
the sharpening of your cognition. And in fact that short-term stress
brings certain elements of the brain online that allow you to focus.
Now, it narrows your focus. You're not good at seeing the so-called
big picture, but it narrows your focus. It allows you to do these,
what I call duration path outcome types of analysis. It allows you to
evaluate your environment, evaluate what you need to do. It primes
your whole system for better cognition. It primes your immune system
to combat infection. And that all makes sense when you think about
that the fact that famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral
infections, invaders, all of this stuff liberates a response in the
body that's designed to get you to fight back against whatever
stressor that happens to be. Psychological, physical, bacterial,
viral. Again, the stress response is generic. The tool takes advantage
of the fact that when adrenaline is released in the body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2732"&gt;Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the adrenals, it has the effect of also liberating a lot of these
killer cells from the immune organs, in particular from the spleen,
but from elsewhere as well, and interactions with the lymphatic system
that combat infection. The way this works in the real world is best
captured by a study that can be mapped back to so-called Wim Hof
breathing. Now, Wim Hof breathing is so named after the so-called
"Iceman," Wim Hof. Wim Hof, of course, being this Dutch. He, I think
he has self-titled Daredevil. And indeed he has many, many Guinness
Book of World Records for things like swimming under icebergs and
going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts and crossing the desert without
water, et cetera. Things that are quite dangerous if you don't know
what you're doing. And Wim obviously survived or I'm telling you he
survived. But there are two components to a sort of breathing protocol
that he developed that was based also on what's called Tummo
breathing, T-U-M-M-O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=2800"&gt;Cyclic Deep Breathing IS Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo &amp;amp; Super-Oxygenation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, before Wim, there was Tummo breathing. And many people call this
now super oxygenation breathing. Although the breath work aficionados
will probably say, well, it's not super oxygenation because you're
also blowing an awful lot of carbon dioxide. What I'm talking about
here, regardless of whether or not it's called Wim Hof, Tummo, or
super oxygenation, is rapid deliberate breathing. So, it's deliberate
hyperventilation. Why would somebody want to do this? Well, deliberate
hyperventilation done for maybe 25 cycles. So inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, it's done in through the nose out
through the mouth. Although sometimes it's just through the mouth. If
you do that for 15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, you will feel very
alert. People who have anxiety will feel anxious. They might even have
an anxiety attack. However, we need to ask why that kind of breathing
feels that way. And it's because that pattern of breathing, rapid
movements of the diaphragm will liberate adrenaline from the adrenals.
So, it's the release of adrenaline. I mentioned that Wim is also
called "The Iceman." Well, that's because he actually discovered this
pattern of breathing, somewhat. And again, it maps back to Tummo
breathing by going into cold water. When you go into cold water, that
too is a stressor and you liberate adrenaline in response to cold
water. So, if you get into an ice bath or a cold shower, you will
immediately release adrenaline from your adrenals. Now, there are all
sorts of things related to this about psychological control and stress
thresholds that we'll talk about, but I really want people to
understand that when adrenaline is released in the body, you are in a
better position to combat infections. And so, whether or not you
breathe very quickly in these cycles of 25 breaths and regardless of
what you call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline is released. If you take
a cold shower, adrenaline is released. If you go into an ice bath
deliberately, and even if you do it non-deliberately, adrenaline is
released. You are mimicking the stress response. And that adrenaline
serves to suppress or combat incoming infections. And this was
beautifully shown in a study that was published in a very fine
journal, the "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for the
US." It's literally called "Proceedings of the National Academy of
USA" to distinguish it from other proceedings of other national
academies in other countries. The way the experiment went is that
people were injected with endotoxin or in some cases they were
injected with a bacterial wall that mimics infection. It gives you a
fever. It makes you feel nauseous. It makes you feel sick. It is not
pleasant. Half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing
that looked very much like the pattern of breathing I described a
moment ago of doing 25 deep inhales and exhales followed by an exhale
holding their breath. Then repeating 25 inhales, exhales holding their
breath. So, this would look something like this, or if you're
listening, it sounds like [inhaling and exhaling]. 25, 30 times,
you'll start feeling heated up. You'll start feeling the adrenaline
response. You're liberating adrenaline in your body. Then exhale, hold
your breath for 15 seconds and then repeat. And then typically, after
doing three or four rounds of that, they would inhale very deeply and
hold their breath. Now, I want to emphasize never ever, ever do this
anywhere near water. People have passed out. So-called shallow water
blackout. People have died. Don't do it in the bathtub. Don't do it
the hot tub. Don't do it before swimming. Please don't do it anywhere
near water. Please don't do it at all, unless you get clearance to do
it from your doctor because there are some pulmonary effects and
whatnot. And the breath holds should definitely not be done by anyone
that has glaucoma pressure concerns for the eyes. But these repeated
cycles of breathing that liberate adrenaline allowed the group that
did that protocol to essentially experience zero symptoms from the
ejection of this E. coli, which is remarkable. They had much reduced
or no symptoms. They didn't feel feverish. They didn't feel sick. They
weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, which is remarkable, but makes total
sense when you think about the fact that the short-term stress
response there, what's typically called the acute stress response,
it's designed to combat all stressors. In fact, were you to cut
yourself very deeply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3058"&gt;Inflammation Is Useful and Good, In the Short Term&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while out on a hike in the woods, the other thing that would happen is
that there would be a rapid inflammation response. And we always hear
inflammation is bad. Inflammation gives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation
is the worst thing. But the swelling is associated, the inflammation
is associated with the recruitment of things like macrophages or
microglia if it's a neural tissue. Cells in our brain and body whose
job is to act like little ambulances and rush to that site and clean
it up. And indeed the inflammation response looks horrible, it sounds
horrible, but it's a great thing in the short-term. You want to have
that tissue marked as in trouble and you want the body and brain to
react to it. So, if you're getting peaks in stress from time to time
throughout your day or throughout your week, you are in a better
position to combat infection. You are any better position to heal your
wounds, physical wounds. Many great things happen in the stress
response. Now, of course, the stress response isn't always super
intense. Sometimes it's milder. Sometimes it allows us to just focus
on something because we have a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3122"&gt;Procrastination and Self-Manufactured Nootropics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can feel stressful, but that's one of the reasons you
procrastinators out there, people are always asking me what can be
done for procrastination? What can be done for procrastination is you
can understand what's happening, which is that you are self-imposing
stress because stress acts like a drug. It is a powerful nootropic. I
get asked about nootropics. The most powerful nootropic or smart drug
is stress. It's the concern of failure. It's the desire to do well.
It's the impending deadline. It's the, "Oh my gosh, I have to do this
thing now or I'm going to fail." That is the best nootropic you will
ever find. That combined with a good night's sleep, which we'll talk
about. But we spent a whole month on sleep. So, I don't want to
backtrack too much. Okay. So, short-term stress, great. The key is to
be able to turn the stress response off when you're done, when you
don't want that. In fact, let's just really tamp down the relationship
between the short-term or acute stress response and infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3180"&gt;Relaxation Can Causes Illness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are familiar with the experience of work, work, work, work,
work, or taking care of a loved one, or stress, stress, stress,
stress, then we finally relax. Maybe we even go on vacation. Like,
"Oh, now I'm finally going to get the break." And then we get sick.
And that's because the adrenaline response crashed and your immune
system crashed with it. So, please understand this. Now, many of you
might say, "Well, how long? Is it two hours? Is it three hours?" A lot
of you out there that really like specificity, it will vary for
everybody. I would just kind of use a rule of thumb. When you are no
longer able to achieve good sleep, what good sleep means to you, and
please see the episodes on sleep if you want more about tools to
sleep, when you are no longer able to achieve good sleep, you are now
moving from acute stress to chronic stress. You need to be able to
turn the stress response off. If I have one wish, well, I have many
wishes for this lifetime, but if I have one wish today that I hope
will permeate and spread out there, is this idea that we need from a
young age, but even as adults and forever, we need to learn how to
turn off our stress response. Physiological sigh is one. If we're
going to activate our stress response intentionally by ice baths, cold
showers, cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing, aka Tummo breathing or Wim
Hof breathing, we also need to learn how to press the brake. Okay? So,
let's think about the stress system. It knows how to activate itself.
Now we're talking about a way of deliberately activating your stress
system in order to combat infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3270"&gt;Immune Activation Protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do this from time to time. I might feel a tickle in my throat or
like I'm getting kind of run down, I will do this kind of breathing. I
do. I will take 25 or 30 breaths. Exhale, hold my breath. 25, 30
breaths again, exhale, hold my breath for about 15 seconds. 25, 30
breaths again, exhale, hold my breath for 25 or 30 seconds. Then a big
inhale. And I hold my breath until I feel the impulse to breathe.
Again, I feel it's safe for me. I've run it by my doctor, so it's
fine. You should not do this unless it's right for you. But I do this.
Some people like the ice bath. I rarely do the ice bath. Some people
like cold showers. I like hot showers. So, I take hot showers, but I
do this kind of breathing. Again, they are all having more or less the
same effect of increasing adrenaline, which allows you to combat the
infection because you're activating the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3320"&gt;Medium Term Stress: A Clear Definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So, now let's talk about medium-term stress. Medium-term stress
is going to be stress that lasts anywhere from several days to several
weeks. Okay. We might think of that as long-term stress. There are
times in life when we are just dealing with a lot. Okay? This
particular quarter, I happened to be directing a course, I'm doing the
lab, I'm doing this. I enjoy all these things immensely, but I'm kind
of near my threshold. I'm near the point where any additional thing,
like I couldn't log onto a website the other day and it felt like the
most intense thing in the world at that moment. And I kind of laughed
at myself. Fortunately, I caught it. But that typically wouldn't be my
response under conditions where I wasn't pushed to threshold. What is
this medium-term stress? What is stress threshold? Well, stress
threshold is actually our ability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3367"&gt;Stress Threshold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to cognitive re-regulate what's going on in our body. So, we all hear
so much about we need to unify our mind and body. We need to be at one
with our mind and body or whatever. Now I realize I'm kind of poking
fun at some of the new agey language, but the reason I poke fun is not
because I don't think it has value, but it has no specificity. What
does that mean? I mean, I think I'm always in my body. I've never
fortunately looked across the room and seen my arm over there or my
leg over there. I'm connected to my body. There actually is a syndrome
where people feel disconnected from their limbs. This is a real
clinical condition. These people actually will seek out amputation.
They will try and convince doctors to amputate certain portions of
their body. It's a really terrible thing for people to have. And it
relates to a change in central maps in the brain, believe it or not.
Most of us want to keep our limbs, whichever ones we happen to have.
And most of us feel one in mind and body so much so that when stress
hits, we feel it in our mind and body. A lot of stress inoculation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3430"&gt;Stress Inoculation Tools: Separating Mind &amp;amp; Body, On Purpose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a lot of managing medium-term stress on the timescale of weeks or
maybe even a couple months, so we're not talking about years of
stress, a lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold.
It's about capacity. And there are very simple tools, excellent tools
that will allow us to modulate our capacity for stress. And they look
a lot like the tools I just described. They involve placing oneself
deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased
somewhat not to the extreme. And then when we feel flooded with
adrenaline, and normally we would panic, it's about cognitively,
mentally, emotionally calming ourselves and being comfortable with
that response in our body. So, unlike trying to unify the mind and
body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about
dissociating mind and body in a healthy way. And what would this look
like? Well, this is something I actually do as a practice because I
mentioned before, you can use physiological sighs in real time, you
can use the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection if
you're feeling kind of run down. And there's also a way in which you
can use things like cold showers, or if you exercise and you bring
your heart rate up very high, you kind of go into that high-intensity
realm where your heart is beating a little bit harder than you're
comfortable with and that you're just you feel, some people think it's
lactic acid. No one can agree on this what the burn is, whether or not
it's lactic acids or it's buildup of hydrogen or whatever. I don't
want to get into that, but we're all familiar with the intense feeling
of your muscles kind of burning because you're working very hard
physically. The key in those moments is to learn to relax the mind
while the body is very activated. And what that tends to do, there's a
limited amount of research on this, but what that tends to do is it
tends to create a situation where what once felt like a lot feels
manageable. Okay? That you've raised your stress threshold or your
stress capacity. One way that you can do this, and this is kind of
fun, if it's approved by your physician and you're able to do this,
you can bring your heart rate up. You can do this through an ice bath
if that's your thing or a cold shower or cyclic oxygenation breathing
or you could sprint or you could go hard on the bike, whenever it is
that brings your heart rate up. And then what you want to do is you
want to actually try and calm the mind while your body is in this
heightened state of activation. And the best way that I'm aware to do
that, again goes back to physiology, not psychology. When we are
stressed, our pupils dilate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3590"&gt;Use Vision to Calm the Mind When the Body Is Agitated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of that pupil dilation is to create tunnel vision. It
literally narrows our view of the visual world. We no longer see in
Panorama. And there's some other effects as well. But that's because
the visual system through this cranial nerve system that I described
before is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system. By
deliberately dilating your gaze, meaning not moving your head and eyes
around, but by deliberately going from tunnel vision to broader
panoramic vision, literally seeing more of your environment all at
once. You don't have to do what I'm doing, which is not blinking.
You're welcome to blink. But it means deliberately dilating your gaze
so that you can see yourself in the environment you're in. It creates
a calming effect on the mind because it releases a particular circuit
in the brainstem that's associated with alertness, aka stress. Now,
this is very powerful. If you're running, for instance, and you're at
max capacity or close to it, or you're kind of hitting like 80, 90% of
maximum on the bike and you dilate your gaze, what you'll find is the
mind can relax while the body is in full output. And this relates to
work that in various communities, people are working with this in the
sports community, military community, et cetera. But it's a form, not
really of stress inoculation, it's more about raising stress threshold
so that the body is going to continue to be in a high alertness, high
reactivity mode, high output, but the mind is calm. And so, this isn't
about unifying mind and body. This is actually about using body to
bring up your level of activation, then dissociating, not the clinical
dissociation kind of disorders, but dissociating the mental or
emotional response from what's going on in your body. And over time,
so if you do this a couple of times, you don't have to do this every
workout, but if you do this every maybe once a week or so, you start
being comfortable at these higher activation states. What once felt
overwhelming and like a lot of work, now is manageable. It feels
tolerable. So, that's for navigating medium-term stress. Now, there
are other tools as well, but we don't want to go over 90 minutes
because 90 minutes is one old trading cycle. I was trying to keep
these podcasts to one on trading cycle, in case you haven't noticed,
so you can derive maximum benefit from them based on all trading and
cycle principles of learning. So, I don't want to go into every little
bit of this. And I want to make sure we get to emotions. But I want to
emphasize that these medium-term stressors, of, "Oh, it's been a hard
month, or hard week." Stanford's on the quarter system. So 10 weeks or
semester. That becomes more manageable when we train ourselves to be
calm of mind when our body is activated. And if you haven't noticed,
most of the tools I'm describing today are nothing like the sort of,
okay, sit and do meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3756"&gt;Beyond NSDR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actively avoiding saying the words NSDR, non-sleep deep rest. I
talked a lot about those tools during the months on sleep and
neuroplasticity. And of course, they are wonderful for replenishing
your ability to lean into effort, to learn to focus. Please do try and
check out NSDR protocol. See if they're right for you. The margins for
safety, I think are enormous. You're basically just listening to a
script. We have links to them in previous captions. I've talked on
them on various podcasts before. We can provide them again. But today
I'm really talking about tools, so you can learn to dance with stress.
To in the short-term, reduce that stress response a little bit if you
feel it's too uncomfortable. In the medium-term, to be comfortable
with these heightened levels of activation because life is going to
continue to come at you. And we can't pick the stressors, but we need
to be able to function at a higher capacity often. And then there's
long-term stress. Now, long-term stress is bad. You do not want
adrenaline up in your system for a very long time. In fact, you
ideally, you would have your stress go up various times throughout the
day, but it would never stay elevated and it would never prevent you
from getting a good night's sleep. Now, that isn't realistic. Okay? I
would say for me, three, four nights out of the month, no matter what
I do, I take on too much or something happens in life is life and I
don't get the best night's sleep that I would like to get. For many of
you, it's 30 nights per month. For some of you, it's zero nights per
month. And congratulations to you zero nights per month people. If you
are managing your sleep really well every night, that is fantastic.
You really want to be able to fall asleep at night, stay asleep for
most of the night. And if you get up, go back to sleep for as long as
you need to in order to feel rested. That's what I define as a healthy
relationship to sleep. Check out the episodes on sleep if you want
tools to be able to accomplish that. And we can all accomplish that.
It can be done. And there are tools to do it. Zero-cost tools. Okay,
so let's talk about long-term stress. Earlier, I talked about how
breathing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3876"&gt;Long Term Stress: Definition, Measurement, Cardiovascular Risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can modulate heart rate through this loop that includes the brain and
the parasympathetic nervous system. I don't think I mentioned this,
and I want to make sure that I mentioned that breathing controlling
heart rate through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system
is the basis of what's called HRV, heart rate variability. And we know
that heart rate variability is good. You don't want your heart rate
chronically elevated or chronically low. A lot of people think, "Oh, I
want a really nice low heart rate." And indeed, if you're in shape,
the stroke volume of your heart will be greater and you can have a
nice slow heart rate. Years ago when I was running regularly, I think
my heart rate was down to like 50 or 60 or something like that. That's
great. But, and now it's higher than that because I'm running a little
bit less. But everyone needs to determine what's right for them. But
you don't really want your heart rate to be chronically low or
chronically high. Both are bad. We know that chronic stress, elevated
stress and especially in the so-called type A personalities creates
heart disease, the leading killer of for in most, every country, but
in particular in the US. Because of the way that adrenaline impacts
those blood vessels or constricting some and dilating others, it's
just that kind of hypertension, chronic hypertension is just bad. And
so, chronic stress truly is bad. I want to really make that clear
because I emphasized a lot of what some of the positive effects of
stress. But you want to be able to tamp down your stress in real time.
You also want to be able to modulate your stress and your emotional
relationship to stress in the body in the medium-term, but by no means
do you want to be stressed out all the time, chronically for months
and months and months and years on end. The best tools, the best
mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=3990"&gt;Tools for Dealing With Long Term Stress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that we know to modulate long-term stress might surprise you a little
bit. First of all, there are going to be the things that don't
surprise you, which is everyone knows getting regular exercise,
getting good sleep, using real-time tools to try and tamp down the
stress response, et cetera, that's all going to be really useful. The
data really points to the fact that social connection and certain
types of social connection in particular are what are going to
mitigate or reduce long-term stress. And this is a particularly
important issue nowadays where we have all these proxies or surrogates
for social connection. We're online and texting with people a lot, so
we can feel connected. Like the plane's about to take off and
everyone's texting each other whether or not they have fear of flying
or not. They're like, "Okay, see you. Love you. Hate you." Whatever it
is that they're trying to communicate to people. Then plane lands,
every phone's out, "See you. Love you. Hate you." Let's hope it's
fewer hate yous. But everyone has this kind of need to stay connected
to one another. Humans are incredibly social creatures. Now, there is
a way to look at this whole business of social connection, not from
just the kind of wishy-washy new agey perspective. And I want to point
out that sometimes I'll say wishy-washy new agey. I have nothing
against that. I just, my goal here is always to put scientific data
and some neurochemistry on things so that for those of you that are
into wishy-washy new agey stuff, you also can arm yourself with some
arguments for those of the members of your family and your life that
maybe aren't so tuned into the typical language around those practices
like, "Oh, connection is really key. We all get oxytocin." Actually,
did you know that connection between individuals rarely causes the
release of oxytocin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4100"&gt;The Oxytocin Myth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is released in very particular circumstances like post-
orgasm, baby and mother milk let down. It's associated with kind of
really intense kinds of pair bonding things of mother and child. Also
father and child, but especially mother and child, because its
relationship to the lactation system. Couples post-sex. These kinds of
things that reflect deep kind of layers of our biology. And oxytocin
is not just released when we walk in and pat the dog on the head or we
see somebody and we give them a hug and, "Hi, great to see you," fist
bump. That's not a situation for oxytocin. The way to think about
social connection and how it can mitigate some of the long-term
effects of stress is really through the systems of neuromodulation
like serotonin, and through blocking certain things that are really
bad for us when we feel socially isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4155"&gt;Serotonin: Satiety, Safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like Taqi Kynan. So, let me explain what these are. Serotonin
again, is a neuromodulator. Neuromodulators are a little bit like
playlists in the brain. They tend to amplify or bias the likelihood
that certain brain circuits and body circuits are going to be
activated and that others will not. Serotonin generally, and I realize
I'm speaking very generally here, but it generally gives us feelings
of wellbeing. At very high levels, it makes us feel blissed and it
tends to make us feel like we have enough in our immediate
environment. This is why some of the side effects of antidepressants
that elevate serotonin, and actually can help a lot of people with
depressive symptoms. But the side effects associated with drugs that
increase serotonin tend to be reduced affect. They tend to kind of
blunt affect or make people feel like their libido is lower. Desire
goes down because the body has so much serotonin and the brain has so
much serotonin, that one feels like they have enough. But serotonin,
pharmacology aside or taking antidepressants aside a topic for another
time, serotonin tends to make us feel good. When we see somebody that
we recognize and trust, serotonin is released in the brain. And that
has certain positive effects on the immune system and on other systems
of neural repair and synopsis and things that really reinforce
connections in the brain and prevent that long-term withering of
connections. So, serotonin is tied to social connection. Now, social
connection can take many forms. As many of you know, I am very
attached to my dog. I hope he's attached to me. He's asleep most of
the time. So, I don't know. And even if he was awake, I don't really
know what I would ask him. But he seems more or less to be attached to
me as well. And there's no scientific evidence that it has to be
human-human attachment. I do have attachments to humans as well. But
you can have attachments to other people. Some of those can be
romantic attachments. They could be familial attachments that are non-
romantic, friendship, pets, even attachments to things that just
delight us. One of the things that really can mitigate against the
long-term negative effects of chronic long-term stress isn't just
having fun. We hear all this stuff, "You need to play and have fun."
That can be a little bit of a tough concept, especially for the hard
driving people or people that are stressed, but having a sense of
delight, a sense of really enjoying something that you see and engage
in, witness, or participate in, that is associated with the serotonin
system. And certainly, play is one of those things. Social connection
of various forms. Those are things to invest in. Some people might
say, "Well, nobody wants to be my friend," or, "Nobody wants to engage
socially anymore." I'll be the first to admit, social connection and
friendship and relationships of all kinds to animals or humans or
inanimate objects takes work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4320"&gt;Delight and Flexibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes investment. It takes time in not needing everything to be
exactly the way you want it to be. I have a friend who struggles with
this and oftentimes the conversations just circle back to the fact
that when you want social connection, you often have to be more
flexible. You have to eat on other people's schedules. Sometimes you
have to eat things you don't necessarily want to eat the most in that
moment or stay up a little later or wake up a little earlier. Social
connection is something that we work for, but it is incredibly
powerful. I want to, of course, tip my heart to, it's only appropriate
to call him the great Robert Sapolsky, my colleague who I'm
unfortunate to know at Stanford. Of course, he has talked about this
quite a lot. So, I want to acknowledge Robert's incredible work and
discussions around this. You can look up those materials online and
his wonderful books. But primates, and we are primates, we are social
species. And as Robert has said many times before, never before in any
primate history, but in particular in human history have we interacted
with so many strangers at a distance when we are not really connected
to them. So, finding just a few people, even one or an animal or
something that you delight in, believe it or not, has very positive
effects on mitigating this long-term stress on improving various
aspects of our life as it relates to stress and emotionality. So,
that's the social connection part. The other thing is the social
isolation that goes too long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4410"&gt;Chemical Irritants We Make But Can Control: Tackykinin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is associated in everything from flies, believe it or not, to mice and
humans with this molecule of Taqi Kynan. Taqi Kynan is a molecule that
makes us more fearful, paranoid, and impairs our immune system. And
so, Taqi Kynan is like this internal punishment signal. It's like our
body and our brain telling us, "You're not spending enough time with
people that you really trust. You're not spending time doing things
that you really enjoy." And I often think about Taqi Kynan for myself
because I'm pretty hard driving. I have a lot of pursuits. I also have
a lot of wonderful people and an incredibly wonderful bulldog in my
life, but there are times when I can be so goal-directed and so in
motion and trying to accomplish everything, that I sometimes forget
about Taqi Kynan. And I like to remind myself so much so that I
actually have a little post-it above my desk that says, "Taqi Kynan,"
to remind me that Taqi Kynan is this very sinister molecule that
starts being secreted when we are not socially connected enough. And
this is why long meals with friends or family where there are, we'll
talk about phones in a moment, but where there's no intrusions, or
even if there are, just feeling like we are connected suppresses Taqi
Kynan. And Taqi Kynan is something you really want to avoid because
chronic isolation, chronically high Taqi Kynan that's associated with
long-term stress really depletes so many good functions of our brain
and body and promote so many bad ones including irritability,
paranoia, fear, et cetera. That is really something to avoid. And so,
I want to highlight Taqi Kynan as something to avoid. I don't want to
completely disregard oxytocin. It's just, the oxytocin has been built
up a lot in the media and really serotonin works on much faster
timescales. Now, how do you know if you're making serotonin? And you
don't know in the moment, but you can learn if you pay attention to
kind of recognize these feelings of comfort, trust, bliss, delight.
And those are not weak terms. Those are not associated just with
psychological terms. They are every bit as physiological as the
movement of your muscles or the secretion of adrenaline. And many
people focus now on gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4540"&gt;Impactful Gratitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is a little bit subjective. And here we're moving from some
objective to kind of subjective things, but recognizing, and in
particular, writing down things that you're thankful for, however
small, they may seem, does seem to have a positive effect on the
serotonin system. Now, there are a plethora of things that will also
impact wellbeing and allow you to modulate your long-term stress.
Reduce the likelihood that you'll engage in long-term stress. And we
don't have time to go into all these, but of course, finding the diet
and nutrition that's right for you, the exercise schedule that's right
for you, the sleep schedule, all that. But do not underemphasize the
social connection part, please. As well, there are some compounds that
are not antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4585"&gt;Non-Prescription Chemical Compounds For Additional Anti-Stress Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although if you need antidepressants, then a clinician prescribes them
to you. Please follow their advice if that's what is right for you.
There are compounds that are not prescription compounds that can
modulate the stress system. And sometimes because of the way that life
is, we just don't have the opportunity to control life and to control
our response to stress. And at least for myself, I can only talk about
my own experience, I found it useful in times of chronic stress to
start modulating some of the neurochemistry related to the stress
response in order to help. Now, if a doctor prescribes you prednisone
or prescribes you some other hormone or something, that's important,
but what I'm talking about now are non-prescription things. You should
check out examine.com, this free website which will allow you to put
in any supplement and evaluate that supplement with they provide links
in the so-called human effect matrix to PubMed. It tells you the exact
subjects they were done in. It was a post-menopausal women. Was it
kids? Was it normal adults? Was it people with autism, et cetera.
Check out that site for any and all supplements you're considering or
taking. I highly recommend it. I've no relationship to them. I just
think it's a wonderful site that's curated all this important
information. But some of these compounds are effective enough. They
can kind of take the edge off. And I'll use them periodically myself.
And so, I just thought I'd mentioned them since there a number of you
that are interested in them. The three I want to focus on and one that
I think you need to be cautious about that I've mentioned before,
include ashwagandha, funny name, but that's what's it's called,
L-theanine or theanine it's often called, and melatonin. Let's talk
about melatonin first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4684"&gt;Melatonin: Cautionary Note About Adrenal Suppression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melatonin I talked about during the month on sleep. Melatonin is a
hormone secreted from the pineal in direct relationship to how much
darkness you are in. Not emotional darkness. But light suppresses
melatonin. Melatonin helps you fall asleep. It doesn't help you stay
asleep. I personally do not recommend supplementing melatonin because
it's supplemented typically at very high levels. One to three
milligrams or even more that is an outrageously high dose. It's super,
super physiological compared to what you normally would make. It also
has a number of potentially negative effects on the reproductive
access and hormones there. Some people can take it without problems.
If you like it and that's your thing, fine. I just want to cue to the
fact that there can be issues. You should check on examine.com. Talk
to your doctor, especially in kids, because melatonin suppresses the
puberty response in a number of species. Enough about the negative
things in melatonin except that people who take too much melatonin
chronically, oftentimes when they're taking it to sleep or for
whatever reason, yes, it can reduce anxiety and stress, but it also
can reduce the output of the adrenals to the point where it can become
problematic. Now, a note about adrenal burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4755"&gt;Adrenal Burnout Is A Myth… But Why You Need to Know About It Anyway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is actually no such thing as adrenal burnout under normal
conditions. The adrenals have enough adrenaline to support 200 years
of stress for better, for worse. The concept of adrenal burnout has
origins in the work of Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, who actually
discovered what he called the general adaptation syndrome. He
discovered a lot of things about stress. He did some phenomenal work
that turned out to be true. That we have stressors. There's something
called distress. He talked about eustress, which is positive stress.
Eustress has never really caught on in the kind of more general
discussion. But he had this theory that if stress went on long enough,
that you would eventually reach a phase called exhaustion. And that
turned out to be wrong. Although many of you may feel exhausted after
chronic stress, there isn't really a physiological exhaustion that
happens. And that eventually got picked up and ran with the general
public. And they talk about adrenal burnout. Too much coffee, adrenal
burnout. You hear all this stuff. There is no such thing as adrenal
burnout. The adrenals don't burn out. There is something, however,
called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, which is a real physiological
problem where some people have very impaired adrenals and they can't
produce adrenaline. And melatonin taken at very high levels for
periods of time that are too long can cause suppression of the
cortisol and epinephrine released from the adrenals and can create a
kind of pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, be aware of
melatonin for that reason. Please, I'm trying, I alone can't get rid
of the phrase adrenal burnout. I'm not trying to give a hard time to
anyone who feels burnt out or exhausted, but it is for other reasons.
It is not because of the adrenals are burnt out. Unless you happen to
have adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, I'm not a fan of melatonin
for a lot of reasons. Now I've mentioned several. The other is
L-theanine. I've talked about L-theanine,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4870"&gt;L-Theanine For Stress Reduction and Task Completion Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which provided it's safe for you, can be taken 100 milligrams or 200
milligrams about 30 minutes or 60 minutes before sleep. It can enhance
the transition to sleep and depth of sleep for many people. It
increases GABA, this inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It
tends to turn off our forebrain a little bit or reduce the activity of
our kind of thinking systems and ruminating systems help people fall
asleep. That's for sleep. But theanine has also been shown for people
that are chronically anxious or chronically stressed to, if you look
at the studies, I have a large collection of studies in front of me
right now, if you want to see those links, I know if you want those,
go to examine.com, put in theanine. They linked, for instance, it is
known to significantly increase relaxation. There are four studies
listed there with PubMed links. It is known to have a minor effect on
anxiety, but eight studies have shown that. Which I think is a fairly
large set of studies. Some of them in great journals. It also can
reduce task completion anxiety. So, anxiety related to task
completion. Not good for the procrastinators perhaps, but for those of
you that are chronically stressed. It can increase attention a little
bit, it can reduce blood pressure a little bit, improve sleep quality,
et cetera. It definitely has a notable effect on stress, two studies
in particular, that it can notably reduce the effects of stress. So,
there's a lot there. It also has effects on insomnia, on some blood
lipid profiles. And so, go to examine.com and check it out. But this
is one reason why I supplement theanine for sleep. But if I'm feeling
like I've been under a lot of stress and I'm not managing my stress
very well with the short-term and medium-term tools that I talked
about earlier, I might start taking a little bit of theanine
especially in the late afternoon, which is when I tend to start to
feel like I haven't gotten enough done and the day is kind of carrying
on. And so, you can blunt the response to stress a little bit, which
is why a lot of companies are now putting theanine into energy drinks.
I am not a big fan of most energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=4980"&gt;Beware Taurine and Energy Drinks With Taurine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them have taurine, which I know some of you wrote to me and
said, "Oh, taurine is great for all these reasons." Taurine also has
effects on the microvasculature that at least for me, were not good.
It cause bursting of microvasculature in my sclera, in my eyes, which
is why I'm not a fan of any energy drink that has taurine or taurine
generally. But that's just me. You have to decide for you. I'm sure in
the comment section, there'll be a couple of taurinesters out there
that will say, "But I love taurine." Great. Keep the taurine companies
in business. But it's not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=5010"&gt;Ashwagandha: Can Powerfully Lower Anxiety And Cortisol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'd like people to know that it may or may not be for them. The
other supplement that can be very useful is ashwagandha. Ashwagandha
is known to lower anxiety and cortisol. There is six, there are,
excuse me, six studies that collectively show reductions in cortisol,
which is cortisol is typically associated with waking up in the
morning, which is good. That's a healthy, brief cortisol bump that
goes away provided you're getting your light at the right time of days
at correct times of day, like morning and evening. But you don't want
cortisol chronically elevated. That's associated with all the bad
stuff about stress. There's a very strong effect of ashwagandha. You
can find dosages at examine.com. They report in across six studies,
14.5 to 27.9 reduction in cortisol in otherwise healthy, but stressed
individuals. Now, I don't know about kids. You have to look at what it
says on various supplements. Most things here are being done in
adults. So, please check carefully. But this is great. I mean, the
opportunity for me anyway, to be able to take something that can help
me reduce my cortisol so that I don't get some of the long-term
effects of stress. And I'm not going to take ashwagandha year round. I
would only do this if I was feeling like I wasn't managing my short
and medium-term stress well. So, I don't take it on a regular basis. I
do take it when I'm in these times when things are particularly
stressful. It has their five other studies that show reduced stress.
So, that's not cortisol measurements, but things like fatigue,
cognitive impairment, et cetera. It does lower total cholesterol,
which may or may not be good or bad for you up to 10%. So, some people
don't want their cholesterol lowered. Some people might. Cholesterol,
we'll talk about this in a month on hormones, but cholesterol is the
molecule from which testosterone and estrogen and cortisol for that
matter are synthesized. So, you don't want to get your cholesterol so
low, then there are all sorts of negative effects, but you don't want
it too high either. Mild effects in good clinical studies on reducing
depression, probably associated with the effects on stress and some
other things as well. So, ashwagandha is something I use from time to
time. It's kind of interesting. L-theanine, I rarely will use those
during the daytime, except under conditions where I'm feeling
chronically stressed. So, check out the human effect matrix on
examine.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=5150"&gt;Examine.com Is An Amazing Free Resource&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a phenomenal website. I think I've sent them a few emails
before. That's the only exchanges I've ever had with them. But I just
think it's wonderful that they put together this resource. Otherwise
we'd be stuck mining PubMed. They've collated the papers from PubMed
with links to PubMed. So, terrific resource. So, social connection and
some supplementation. Of course, diet, exercise, sleep for long-term
stress. And now we're finally in a position to talk about what we have
set out to do from the beginning, which is spend the month on
emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=5180"&gt;How This All Relates to Emotions: State Versus Demand = Valence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very important that we discuss stress and we discuss in the
context of short, medium, and long-term stress. That we discuss tools
for short-term, medium-term, and long-term control. I don't really
want to say mitigation of stress. Stress is going to happen. But our
ability to modulate and control stress in real time offline using
tools such as respiration, using tools such as dilation of gaze, using
tools like social connection, maybe some supplements, certainly take
care of your sleep and nutrition and exercise. Again, tons of
resources and information in the sleep episodes. So, you can look
there. We will do a month on hormones, on exercise, et cetera. But
let's talk about emotions because in subsequent episodes, we're going
to talk about OCD, we're going to talk about depression, we're going
to talk about mania, we're going to be talking about dopamine and all
sorts of things. But at the core of emotions is this question, what is
an emotion? Well, it's complex. There isn't a single brain area for
any one of these things that we call emotions. My framework, and I
think the modern science, both psychology and neuroscience is pretty
well-aligned with what Lisa Feldman Barrett has taught about. Now,
Lisa's at Northeastern University. She runs a big lab there. She's a
world expert in emotion. She's written two books that are really
wonderful. One is "How Emotions Are Made," which was her first book.
The second one is "Seven and a Half Facts About the Brain." It's a
wonderful book as well. It came out more recently. I hosted Lisa on an
Instagram live once. Maybe we'll get her here on the podcast if we're
lucky. We don't agree on everything about the neuroscience of
emotions, but I subscribed to most everything that I've heard Lisa
say. In particular, the fact that emotions are context-dependent.
There's a cultural dependence, et cetera. I look at things mainly
through the lens of physiology and neuroscience and kind of low-level
circuitry. And one way to think about emotions that I think is
consistent and I think Lisa would generally approve, I can't speak for
her, but I would hope she would generally approve of this description,
is that when our internal state of stress or calm matches the demands
on us or is mismatched from the demands on us, we tend to interpret
those as good or bad. Let me give you an example. If I am feeling very
anxious, very stressed inside, and I have a lot to do, that doesn't
feel good, but it's really no different than if I'm very tired and I
have a lot to do because there's this mismatch. I'm not in the right
internal state, my internal state is incorrect rather, to meet the
demands that are being placed upon me. So, in both cases, whether I'm
too tired or I'm too stressed to do what I need to do, the valence,
meaning the value that I assigned to that is I don't feel good. It's
not a good situation and I don't feel good. Now, I might call it
stressed, I might call it anxious, I might call it worried, I might
call it a number of things, but it's not good. However, when I'm tired
and I want to fall asleep, well then I feel good because that's what
the demand is. I need to go to sleep and I'm tired. If I'm wide awake
and I need to fall asleep, then that's not good. And then the brain
tends to go down the direction of interpreting the situation as a bad
one. So, while the discussion around emotions is far more nuanced and
more elaborate than this, one way to think about your relationship to
emotions is whether or not your internal state is matching the demands
that are upon you. So, in that way, we don't really place so much
value on whether or not we're feeling alert or sleepy. We only place
value on whether or not that alertness whether or not it's full-blown
stress or not or our sleepiness, whether or not we're falling asleep
or just a little bit drowsy, whether or not that matches the
conditions that we face. And it's a useful framework to have. And it's
the reason in part why I spent this last hour and a half or so talking
about stress and how to control stress. One reason we did that is
because I think it's a valuable opportunity to learn some tools and
understand stress and really learn how to take control of stress,
which I think we could all benefit from doing regardless of age. The
other reason is that when you start to understand that you have this
kind of see-saw system in your body, this autonomic nervous system
that takes you from alert and calm to stressed to full-blown panic, it
has that capacity, or from sleepy and drowsy to passing out tired to
God forbid, let's hope never, but a coma, right? That you're basically
on this see-saw all the time. And where you are on that see-saw of
alertness or calmness positions you to be in better reaction to the
demands that you face. Whether or not the thing that you face is a
need to fall asleep or to listen quietly and not react. You now know,
for instance, that if your job is to take feedback, when maybe you're
going in for a job evaluation or you're in a relationship where there
was a call for a discussion and somebody needs to talk to you about
something and we need to talk about something, you're going to there
you're like, "Goodness, this is going to be rough." Learning to reduce
that stress response a little bit so that you are in a position to
hear the information better, and remember, from a previous episode, if
you close your eyes, you'll be able to actually focus on the
information better. There's your permission to not look someone
directly in the eye when they talk to you if you really want to hear
what they have to say. You will be able to modulate that stress
response and lean into life better. You will be able to react to
things in a more effective way and to not be reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=5520"&gt;Modulating Reactivity, Mindfulness, &amp;amp; Functionality With Objective Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is really one of the important things to me anyway, is that
so much of the language around psychology, which I think is a
wonderful field, but pop psychology in particular is be responsive,
not reactive. Well, great. But then how does one do that? Well, one
does that by modulating their short-term stress response in real time.
Not by saying, "Hold on, I need to meditate. Hold on, I need a massage
and then I can have this conversation." By modulating the reactivity
in real time. How does one, for instance, be mindful? Which is a
beautiful concept, but how are you mindful? Well, I don't know, when
I'm moving through my day, a lot of times I'm just trying to get
things done. And as soon as I start monitoring and seeing what I'm
doing and kind of third-personing what I'm doing, it actually takes me
out of the effectiveness and experience of what I'm doing. So for me,
sometimes that mindfulness, that observer, as they call it, is
something that doesn't help me. It actually hinders me. What's
important to me is to be able to work and focus and then to be able to
disengage. To be able to do a non-sleep depressed or to be able to
still fall asleep even though I've been working hard until 9:30 to put
my head down at 10 o'clock and be out cold sleeping by 10:02. That's
possible if you can learn to control this stress response. And to do
that, we can't use the mind to control. The mind, we need tools. And
so, a lot of the people being grumpy or anxious or depressed, a lot of
that, provided it's not for some underlying neurochemical reason
that's chronic, a lot of that come from being poorly rested, from
overworked, from feeling like the world is bearing down on us. And so,
rather than take a subjective view of this, I take the view of
objective physiology. What can we do that's anchored to these neuronal
systems in our body, in our brain, in our eyes, in our diaphragm, et
cetera, and look to those as tools leavers that we can pull on and
push and maneuver through life in a way where we start to feel like we
have some agency. We actually have some real control because we're
controlling the internal landscape. So, I think that ought to set the
stage for where we're headed next,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=5640"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is to talk about all the things that you normally think of when
you think of emotions, like happiness, like awe, like joy. And we will
get into some of that. But all of that rests firmly on the foundation
of this thing we call the autonomic nervous system. This stress
modulation. This calming modulation system. And again, whether or not
you're activated or you're calm is not good or bad, it depends on the
situation. Certainly, when you want to fall asleep, being activated
isn't good. When you have work to do, being activated is great. So, I
hope today you were able to take a slightly different view of this
thing that we call stress. Not just see it as evil, but see it as
powerful and useful in certain contexts. Great for us in certain
contexts and problematic in other contexts. And as well to think about
the various tools that I've presented that can allow you to adjust and
modulate your internal levels of alertness or calmness so that you can
lean more effectively into life, which includes sleep and social
connection and the work you have to do. And of course, acknowledges
that the events in the world are beyond our control. What's in our
control is how we react to them. Something that's commonly said in the
wellness and self-help and psychology world, but for which there often
aren't as many concrete tools that we can really look to and trust in
real time. And of course, there are other tools out there. As always,
I'll say it, I strive to be accurate, but I'll never be exhaustive. I
might have exhausted you. I might've cured your insomnia with this
discussion today, but in all seriousness, my goal is to bring you
tools and information so that you can manage better through life. So,
thanks so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntfcfJ28eiU&amp;amp;t=5740"&gt;Topic Suggestions, Subscriptions and Reviews Please&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much want to thank all of you for your support for the podcast.
It's really been wonderful. If you've subscribed to the podcast on
YouTube, Apple, or Spotify, or maybe even all three, terrific. If you
haven't, please do subscribe on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify, or maybe
even all three, which would be wonderful. On Apple, you can leave a
five-star review if you think we deserve that as well as a comment
reviewing us. If you have suggestions, if you have questions regarding
the content of the podcast or things that you'd like us to cover in
the future, please put those in the comment section on YouTube as
well. If you could recommend the podcast to friends, family members,
coworkers, that you think would benefit from the information, maybe
even send them the links if you like, that's tremendously helpful.
Today, as in previous episodes, I've touched on some things as they
relate to supplementation. As always, I always cover a lot of tools
that are zero-cost tools that don't involve ingesting anything at all,
behavioral tools. But I mentioned some supplements that I particularly
find useful. With supplements, it's a complicated landscape, often
because many supplement companies don't put in the bottle what they
say is in the particular product. We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-
R-N-E, because Thorne is a supplement company that we know to have the
highest levels of stringency. It's used by the Mayo Clinic. It's used
by all the major sports organizations for that particular reason and
because their quality standards are exceptionally high. If you'd like
to try any supplements and see the ones that I take, you can go to
Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get 20% off
anything that's listed there on my page as well as any of the
supplements that Thorne sells. So that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman
to get 20% off anything that Thorne sells.&lt;/p&gt;

always, really appreciate your time and attention today. I hope you
practice some of the tools if they're right for you. I hope you think
hard about stress and how you can control your stress. And above all,
as always, thank you for your interest in science. [upbeat music]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles
at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring
zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related
tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to
thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is
ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN is a virtual private network that keeps your
data secure by routing your data and online activities through their
servers and keeping your data safe and secure but also not selling
your data to third parties. I started using ExpressVPN because
unfortunately I had my bank accounts hacked. I was traveling a lot and
I typically go on hotel or airline or other public Wi-Fi from time to
time and I don't know how it happened, but somehow my information got
out there, and as I learned more from my friends and people that work
in the tech community, it turns out that many networks are not secure,
so with ExpressVPN, it keeps all your information secure. It keeps
information about your passwords secure. It keeps information about
the websites that you visit secure, and as I mentioned earlier, they
never give away or sell your data. The nice thing is you can use
ExpressVPN, it runs in the background and you don't even really
realize that it's on. It works on your phone, it works on your laptop,
it even works on your smart TV. If you'd like to try ExpressVPN, you
can go to expressvpn.com/huberman to get three months free on their
one-year program. I love ExpressVPN. I use it even when I'm at home,
and so if you want to try it, you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman
and you'll get three months free on their one-year program. The second
sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a
vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started taking Athletic Greens in
2012 because I wanted to cover my vitamin and mineral bases. I didn't
know which things to take. I found it really dizzying to know which
vitamins and minerals to purchase and Athletic Greens allowed me to
get all the things I needed to cover my bases in one easy to consume
formula that also happens to taste really good. I mix mine with water
and a little bit of lemon juice. The probiotics in Athletic Greens are
also really important to me because now there's an abundance of data
showing that the gut microbiome, which is supported by probiotics, is
important for gut-brain axis, mood, metabolic function, hormone
function, just a huge number of biological functions and health
parameters. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman, and if you do that, they'll give you a
year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. Vitamin D3 also has lot of support
from the scientific literature showing that it's important for immune
function, so if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you'll get
Athletic Greens plus the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2 and they'll
give you five free travel packets. Mixing up powders is a little bit
messy sometimes when you're on the road, if you're in the car, you're
on the plane or you're on the move. These travel packets make
everything really clean and really easy. Once again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman for Athletic Greens, the five free travel
packets, and the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. Many of you have
graciously asked how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast.
There are several ways that you can do that. One is to check out our
sponsors, the other is we've set up a Patreon account. You can go to
patreon.com/andrewhuberman and that allows you to donate to the
podcast at a variety of different levels. In addition, if you could
subscribe to the podcast on YouTube, that's terrific. If you haven't
done that already, please do so, and please leave a comment. If you
want to make suggestions about future episodes, please also put that
in the comment section. If you subscribe on Apple or Spotify or both,
that helps us, and as well, Apple gives you the opportunity to leave a
review and give us a five star rating if you feel we deserve a five
star rating, and of course, please recommend the podcast to your
friends, to your family members, anyone that you think would benefit
from the information. Really, the answer to your question of how you
can support the podcast is you don't have to buy products, although
checking out the sponsors does help. You don't have to donate to
Patreon. We, of course, can't require you to subscribe and fill out
reviews and things of that sort, but we like to think that by
providing a number of different ways to support the podcast, some of
which are zero cost, some of which, if you like, gives you the
opportunity to contribute financially, that's terrific as well. Thank
you so much. We really appreciate your interest in helping us keep
this coming your way. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=298"&gt;Deliberate Unlearning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's continue our discussion about neuroplasticity. This incredible
feature of our nervous system that allows it to change itself in
response to experience, and even in ways that we consciously and
deliberately decide to change it. That's an incredible feature. No
other organ in our body has that capability. Our nervous system, which
governs everything about who we are, how we feel and what we do, does
have that capability. The issue is most people don't know how to
access neuroplasticity. Children readily access neuroplasticity and
they don't even realize that they're doing it. Adults want
neuroplasticity and so that's what this entire month of the Huberman
Lab Podcast has been about. We've explored neuroplasticity from a
variety of different perspectives. We talked about representational
plasticity. We talked about the importance of focus and reward. We
talked about this amazing and somewhat surprising aspect of the
vestibular system, how altering our relationship to gravity, and in
addition to that, making errors as we try and learn, can open up
windows to plasticity, but we have not really talked so much about
directing the plasticity toward particular outcomes, and thus far, we
really haven't talked yet about how to undo things that we don't want.
I've talked about learning and I say learn a language, learn free
throws, learn a particular motor skill, et cetera, but what about what
we would call unlearning or about removing some aspect of our
experience that we don't want? And so today, we are going to explore
that aspect of neuroplasticity and we are going to do that in the
context of a very important and somewhat sensitive topic which is pain
regeneration, and in some cases, injury to the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=403"&gt;Pain, Injury and Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that are fortunate enough to not have or had a
concussion or not have or know someone who is experiencing chronic or
acute pain, I encourage you to stay in here with us because a lot of
the information that we are going to cover has direct relevance to
neuroplasticity for other purposes. We, as always here on this
podcast, are going to discuss some of the science, we get into
mechanism, but we also really get at principles. Principles are far
more important than any one experiment or one description of mechanism
and certainly far more important than any one protocol because
principles allow you to think about your nervous system and work with
it in ways that best serve you. They are very flexible batches of
information. We are going to talk about the principles of
neuroplasticity for removing pain and wound healing and injury. We're
going to talk about acupuncture, of all things. We are going to talk
about modern medicine's attempt to try and restore youth to the aging
or injured or demented brain, and we are going to definitely talk
about tools. Got a lot of tools. I consulted a number of fantastic
colleagues at Stanford, at Harvard Medical School, and in the greater
community of tissue rehabilitation, injury and pain management in
preparation for this podcast. I do want to be very clear and just
remind you that I'm not a medical doctor. I'm a professor, so I don't
prescribe anything. I profess things. I have my beliefs, but the
podcast is for information purposes. I do hope that the tools that we
discuss will be of benefit to you, but as always, you should talk to
your doctor or healthcare provider about any tools that you plan to
add or are looking to explore, as well as anything that you might look
to remove from your daily protocols. In other words, don't change
anything without consulting an expert first. You are responsible for
your health, not me, and I say this not just to protect me but also to
protect you. Please keep that in mind as we move forward and I'm very
excited to share with you this information because I do feel that it
can be of great benefit to a number of people. Let's start our
discussion about pain and sensation and regeneration and wound healing
with a discussion about a very important system in the nervous system,
which is the somatosensory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=557"&gt;A System of Touch (Somatosensation)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The somatosensory system is, as the name implies, involved in
understanding touch, physical feeling on our body, and the simplest
way to think about the somatosensory system is that we have little
sensors and those sensors come in the form of neurons, nerve cells,
that reside in our skin and in the deeper layers below the skin, and
indeed, we do. We have some that correspond to, and we should say
respond to, mechanical touch, so pressure on the top of my hand or a
pinpoint, or other sensors, for instance, respond to heat, to cold.
Some respond to vibration. We have a huge number of different
receptors in our skin and they take that information and send it down
these wires that we call axons in the form of electrical signals to
our spinal cord and then up to the brain, and within the spinal cord
and brain, we have centers that interpret that information, that
actually make sense of those electrical signals, and this is amazing
because none of those sensors has a different unique form of
information that it uses. It just sends electrical potentials into the
nervous system. The nervous system, you somehow decode what a given
stimulus on your skin is. Maybe it's the wind blowing gently and
deflecting some of the hairs on your arm or maybe it's a sharp
pinprick or a hot stove or the warmth of a glowing fire. That all
arrives in your nervous system in the form of these electrical things
we call action potentials, which is just amazing, and then the brain
computes them and make sense of them. We have peripheral sensors and
we've got stations up in our brain and within our spinal cord that
make sense of all the stuff coming in. Pain and the sensation of pain
is, believe it or not, a controversial word in the neuroscience field.
People prefer to use the word nociception. Nociceptors are the sensors
in the skin that detect particular types of stimuli. It actually comes
from the Latin word nocere which means to harm, and why would
neuroscientists not want to talk about pain? Well, it's very
subjective. It has a mental component and a physical component. We
cannot say that pain is simply an attempt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=702"&gt;Pain and Injury are Dissociable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to avoid physical harm to the body, and here's why. They actually can
be dissociated from one another. A good example would be if, God
forbid, you were exposed to high levels of radiation, such as working
with some sort of material that was radioactive or you were near a
former radioactive plant or some some radiation, excessive X-rays, et
cetera, you wouldn't feel any pain during the X-rays. In fact, you
don't. If you've ever had X-rays, as I have, you don't feel anything.
They put you under that lead blanket, they run behind a wall and then
they, in my case, then they take these pictures of your teeth and it's
really scary because you go, "Something really terrible must be
happening here," but you don't feel anything, but there can be a lot
of tissue damage. There can be mutations introduced to cells, et
cetera. I've had X-rays, I'm not saying people shouldn't have X-rays,
but excessive X-rays certainly are not good for human beings, likewise
with excessive exposure to any radiation. There can be tissue damage
without the physical perception or mental perception of pain at all.
As well, there can be the belief of pain or the feeling of pain
without there being tissue damage, and there's a famous case that was
published in the "British Journal of Medicine" where a construction
worker, I think he fell is how the story went, and a 14-inch nail went
through his boot and up through the boot and he was in excruciating
pain just beyond anything he'd experienced. He reported that he
couldn't even move in any dimension, even a tiny bit, without feeling
excruciating pain. They brought him into the clinic, into the
hospital, they were able to cut away the boot and they realized that
the nail had gone between two toes and it had actually not impaled the
skin at all. His visual image of the nail going through his boot gave
him the feeling, the legitimate feeling, that he was experiencing the
pain of a nail going through his foot, which is incredible because it
speaks to the power of the mind in this pain scenario and it also
speaks to the power of the specificity. It's not like he thought that
his foot was on fire. He thought, because he saw a nail going through
his foot, well, it was going through his boot, but he thought it was
going through his foot, that it was sharp pain of the sort that a nail
would produce, and there are thousands of these kinds of case reports
out there. That is not to say that all pain that we experience is in
our head, but it really speaks to the incredible capacity that these
top-down, these higher-level cognitive functions have in interpreting
what we're experiencing out in the periphery, even just on the basis
of what we see, and the example of radiation speaks to the fact that
pain and tissue damage are dissociable from one another. Why are we
talking about pain during a month on neuroplasticity? Well, it turns
out that the pain system offers us a number of different principles
that we can leverage to, A, ensure that if we are ever injured, we are
able to understand the difference between injury and pain because
there is a difference, that if we're ever in pain, that we can
understand the difference between injury and pain, that we will be
able to interpret our pain, and during the course of today's podcast,
I'm going to cover protocols that help eliminate pain from both ends
of the spectrum, from the periphery, at the level of the injury, and
through these top-down mental mechanisms. A lot of times on this
podcast, in fact mostly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=919"&gt;Objective versus Subjective Control of Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to center on the physiology, on the really objective things
that you can describe and talk about, diaphragmatic movement or
sunlight of a particular number of photons, et cetera, but today's a
really exciting opportunity for us to discuss some of the more
subjective things. Believe it or not, we're going to talk about love.
A colleague of mine at Stanford, who runs a major pain clinic, is
working on and has published quality peer-reviewed data on the role of
love in modulating the pain response, only there's a twist to it and
I'm not going to reveal it just yet, but it turns out that the
specific type of connection one has to a romantic partner actually
dictates whether or not their love for them will alleviate physical
pain and the effects are really robust. It's an amazing literature,
and so what we're talking about today is plasticity of perception,
which has direct bearing on emotional pain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=975"&gt;Plasticity of Perception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and has direct bearing on trauma and other things that we discussed in
previous episodes a little bit but that we're going to explore even
more in an entire month about those topics. Let's get started in
thinking about what happens with pain, and I will describe some
examples of some kind of extreme cases. For instance, I will tell you
just now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1001"&gt;Lack of Pain Is Self-Destructive; So Is Excessive Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that there is a mutation, a genetic mutation in a particular sodium
channel. A sodium channel is one of these little holes in neurons that
allows them to fire action potentials. It's important to the function
of the neuron. It's also important for the development of certain
neurons, and there's a particular mutation, there are kids that are
born without this sodium channel 1.7, if you want to look it up. Those
kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever, and it is a terrible
situation. They burn themselves. They tend to rest on their limbs too
long. They don't make the microadjustments. You might see me swiveling
around in my chair, moving around a lot. Those microadjustments are
actually normal, healthy microadjustments that prevent us from going
into pain. They don't make those adjustments. They don't get the
feedback that they're in a particular position and so they never make
those adjustments and their joints get destroyed, essentially. They
don't tend to live very long due to accidents. It's a really terrible
and unfortunate circumstance. Some people have a mutation in the same
channel where they make too much of this channel so they feel too much
pain. In fact, it's reasonable to speculate that one of the reasons,
not all, but one of the reasons why people might differ in their
sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation in how many of
these sorts of receptors that they express. People who make too much
of this receptor experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuli. The
good news is there are good drug treatments that can block
specifically this sodium channel 1.7 and so those people get a lot of
relief from taking such drugs. Pain and how much pain we are sensitive
to or insensitive to probably has some genetic basis, and then of
course, there are things that we can do to make sure that we
experience less pain, although pain has this adaptive role. Let's talk
about some of the features of how we're built physically and how that
relates to pain and how we can recover from injury. First of all, we
have maps of our body surface in our brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1122"&gt;Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's called a homunculus. In a rat, believe it or not, I'm not making
this up, it's called a ratunculus. In Costello, my dog, who is snoring
behind me, it's a dogunculus. I could get into the nomenclature and
why it's called this, but it's basically a representation of the body
surface. That representation is scaled in a way that matches
sensitivity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1145"&gt;“Sensitivity” explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so the areas of your body that are most sensitive have a lot more
brain real estate devoted to them. Your back is an enormous piece of
tissue compared to your fingertip, but your back has fewer receptors
devoted to it and the representation of your back in your brain is
actually pretty small, whereas the representation of your finger is
enormous. How big a brain area is devoted to a given body part is
directly related to the density of receptors in that body part, not
the size of the body part, and that's why if we were to draw your
homunculus or Costello's dogunculus, what we would find is that
certain areas, like the lips, like the fingertips, like the genitalia,
like the eyes and the area around the face, would have a huge
representation, whereas the back, the torso, and areas of the body
that are less sensitive are going to have smaller representations.
It'd be a very distorted map. You can actually know how sensitive a
given body part is and how much brain area is devoted to it through
what's called two-point discrimination. You can do this experiment if
you want. I think I've described this once or twice before, but
basically if you have someone put, maybe take two pens and put them
maybe six inches apart on your back and touch while you're facing away
and they'll ask you how many points they're touching you and you say
two, but if they move those closer together, say three inches, you're
likely to experience it as one point of contact, whereas on your
finger, you could play that game all day and as long as there's a
millimeter or so spacing, you will know that it's two points as
opposed to one and that's because there's more pixels, more density of
receptors. This has direct bearing to pain because it says that areas
of the body that have denser receptors are going to be more sensitive
to pain than to others, and where we have more receptors, we tend to
have more blood vessels and glia, which are the support cells, and
other cells that lend to the inflammation response and that's really
important. Just as a rule of thumb, areas of your body that are
injured that are large areas that have low sensitivity before injury
likely are going to experience less pain and the literature shows will
heal more slowly because they don't have as many cells around to
produce inflammation, and you might say, "Wait, I thought inflammation
is bad." Well, one of the things I really want to get across today is
that inflammation is not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1290"&gt;Inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation out of control is bad, but inflammation is wonderful.
Inflammation is the tissue repair response and we are going to talk
about subjective and objective ways to modulate inflammation after
tissue injury, even after just exercise that's been too intense. You
have this map of your body surface. It's sensitive in different ways.
Now you know why. You've got your neurobiology of somatosensation 101
under your belt now. We didn't cover everything, but we'll touch on
some of the other details as we go forward. I thought it might be a
nice time to just think about the relationship between the periphery
and the central maps in a way that many of you have probably heard
about before, which will frame the discussion a little bit better,
which is phantom limb pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1344"&gt;Phantom Limb Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you are probably familiar with this, but for people that have
an arm or a leg or a finger or some other portion of their body
amputated, it's not uncommon for those people to feel as if they still
have that limb or appendage or piece of their body intact, and
typically, unfortunately, the sensation of that limb is not one of the
limb being nice and relaxed and just there. The sensation is that the
limb is experiencing pain or is contorted in the specific orientation
that it was around the time of the injury. If someone has a blunt
force to the hand and they end up having their hand amputated,
typically they will continue to feel pain in their phantom hand, which
is pretty wild, and that's because the representation of that hand is
still intact in the cortex, in the brain, and it's trying to balance
its levels of activity. Normally it's getting what's called
proprioceptive feedback. Proprioception is just our knowledge of where
our limbs are in space. It's an extremely important aspect of our
somatosensory system, and there's no proprioceptive feedback and so a
lot of the circuits start to ramp up their levels of activity and they
become very conscious of the phantom limb. Before my lab was at
Stanford, I was at UC San Diego and one of my colleagues was a guy,
everyone just calls him by his last name, Ramachandran, who is famous
for understanding this phantom limb phenomenon and developing a very
simple but very powerful solution to it that speaks to the incredible
capacity of top-down modulation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1440"&gt;Top-down Relief of Pain by Vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and top-down modulation, the ability to use one's brain cognition and
senses to control pain in the body, is something that everyone, not
just people missing limbs or in chronic pain, can learn to benefit
from because it is a way to tap into our ability to use our mind to
control perceptions of what's happening in our body, and this is not a
mystical statement. This is not about mind, I guess, as much as it is
brain to control our perceptions of our body. What did Ramachandran
do? Ramachandran had people who were missing a limb put their intact
limb into a box that had mirrors in it such that when they looked in
the box and they moved their intact limb, the opposite limb, which was
a reflection of the intact limb 'cause they're missing the opposite
limb, they would see it as if it was intact, and as they would move
their intact limb, they would visualize with their eyes the limb
that's in the place of the absent limb, so this is all by mirrors,
moving around and they would feel immediate relief from the phantom
pain, and he would tell them and they would direct their hand toward a
orientation that felt comfortable to them. Then they would exit the
mirror box, they would take their hand out, and they would feel as if
the hand was now in its relaxed normal position. You could get real
time, in moments, remapping of the representation of the hand. Now,
that's amazing. This is the kind of thing that all of us would like to
be able to do if we are in pain. If you stub your toe, if you break
your ankle, if you take a hard fall on your bike or if you're in
chronic pain. Wouldn't it be amazing to be able to use a mind trick,
but it's not a trick because it's real, visual imagery, to remap your
representation of your body surface and where your body is. That is
something that we could all benefit from because if you do anything
for long enough, including live, you're going to experience pain of
some sort, and this, again I just want to remind you, isn't just about
physical injuries and pain, this has direct relevance to emotional
pain as well, which, of course, we'll talk about. The Ramachandran
studies were really profound because they said a couple things. One,
plasticity can be very fast, that it can be driven by the experience
of something, just the visual experience. He had people do this mirror
box thing but not look into the mirror box and they didn't get the
remapping, so it required visual imagery coming in. We also know, for
instance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1601"&gt;From Deaf to Hearing Sounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that in cases like where people are congenitally deaf, the cochlear
implant, which is simply a way of putting, it's not simple, but it's a
way of putting in a device that replaces the cochlea, the device that
we're normally born with in the ear that has these little what are
called hair cells that deflect according to sound waves and allow us
to hear. By replacing the normal hearing apparatus that's deficient in
deaf people with this cochlear implant, the brain can make sense of
this artificial ear, basically, it's not the outside ear, not the
pinna, but the inner ear, and they can start to hear sounds. Some
people really like the artificial cochlea. They really benefit from
it. It restores their ability to hear and they like it. Other people
don't. Some deaf people would prefer not to hear anything, can be very
disruptive to them, and some of that might have to do with the need
for further better engineering of these artificial cochleas, but all
this really speaks to the fact that the brain is an adaptive device.
It will respond to what you give it. It is not a device that is fixed.
In fact, the essence of the brain, especially the human brain, is to
take sensory inputs and to make sense of those, meaning cognitive
sense, and then to interpret those signals, and so this may come as a
shock to some of you and by no means am I trying to be insensitive,
but pain is a perceptual thing as much as it's a physical thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1690"&gt;Pain Is In The Mind &amp;amp; Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a belief system about what you're experiencing in your body and
that has important relevance for healing different types of injury and
the pain associated with that injury. In people's pursuit for
neuroplasticity, a question that comes up every once in a while is
people will say, "If I just brush my teeth with the opposite hand for
a couple nights in a row, will I get neuroplasticity?" And the answer
is probably yes. It's a deliberate action. You're focusing on it.
There's an end goal. You're very likely to make errors, like jamming
up into your lips and gums at first and then getting better at it, and
as you heard in last episode, making errors is really important 'cause
those errors are the signal that plasticity needs to happen, and then
when you get the actions correct, then those correct actions are
programmed in. I'm not sure that brushing one's teeth with the
opposite hand is the most effective use of this incredible thing that
we have, which is plasticity. It's not going to open up plasticity for
many other things. If that were really important to you, for whatever
reason, maybe you have a crowded bathroom and it's easier to do on one
side or the other, then fine, but it's kind of hard to imagine why
this would be a highly adaptive behavior, unless, of course, you have
an injured limb or you're missing a limb, and that gets me to some
really exciting and important studies that were performed mostly in
the '90s as well as in the 2000s, and that, for now, there is really a
solid base of data. There's really a center of mass around a
particular set of experiments that point to particular protocols for
how to overcome motor injury,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=1784"&gt;Recovering Movement Faster After Injury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this may resonate with some of you who've ever been injured to the
point where you couldn't walk well, temporarily, I hope, or even
longer. Think about a sprained ankle scenario or a broken arm
scenario. We're all familiar with the stories of people having a cast
on and then getting the cast off and the particular limb that wasn't
being used that was casted is much smaller and atrophied. Most of that
atrophy, you might be surprised to learn, is not because the muscles
aren't being used. It's because the nerves sending signals to those
muscles are not active and therefore the muscles aren't contracting.
Work done by a guy named Timothy Schallert and his graduate students
and postdocs, Theresa Jones and others, in the '90s and 2000s showed
something really wonderful that I think we can all benefit from should
we have an injury and even if we simply want to balance out imbalances
in our motor activity, and I think all of us tend to be stronger on
one side or the other side. Usually a right-handed person will be
stronger in their left arm, not always, for compensatory reasons. Some
other time we can talk about handwriting. The lefties likely will be
stronger in their right arm, although it depends on whether or not
people are hook righties, that's when you hook around and write from
the top, or hook lefties. There are all sorts of theories about this
that we can talk about, right brain, left brain, math proficiency, et
cetera. In any event, what Schallert and colleagues showed was that if
we have damage to our brain in the sensory motor pathways, any number
of different sensory motor pathways, or we have damage to a limb,
could be a leg, could be an arm, could be a hand, there's great
benefit to restricting the use of the opposite, better-performing,
uninjured limb or hand or other part of the body. They had about a
dozen papers showing that if there was damage centrally in the brain
or there was damage to a limb, so unilateral damage, as we say, one
side, the thing to do is not to cast up the damaged side, although you
need to do that to protect the limb, of course, from further damage.
If it's a broken arm, you need to cast the arm or you need to brace
the arm, but that the key thing was to restrict movement of the
intact, uninjured, opposite limb, and when they did that, it forced
some movement in the injured limb and remarkably, through connections
from the two sides of the brain, through the corpus callosum, this
huge fiber pathway that links the two sides of the brain, they saw
plasticity on both sides of the brain. This makes sense when you hear
it. Let's say I injure my left ankle and I'm limping along or I'm
using crutches. You would think, well, the last thing you want to do
is injure your opposite limb or not use your opposite limb. My right
ankle is perfectly fine, but if I lean too hard on my right limb and I
take all the work out of the left limb, the left ankle, that's
actually setting up a situation where there's going to be runaway
asymmetry in the central pathways and the nerve-to-muscle pathways on
my left side, and so what they suggested and what they showed in a
variety of experiments was that by encouraging activity of the injured
limb, provided it could be done without pain, and importantly, not
just exercising that limb or part of the body but restricting the
opposite healthy part of the body, that the speed of recovery was
significantly faster. Now, I want to repeat, you don't want to go
injuring something further. That's probably the worst thing you could
do, but in some cases where people have damage in their brain, the
limbs are perfectly fine, but the motor signals aren't getting down to
the limbs, and in that case, the limb is fine, so you actually are
free to use either limb as much as you want, and in that case, you
don't want to rely on the uninjured pathway too much. In fact, you
want to restrict the uninjured pathway. I find these studies
remarkable and they've been followed up on at the molecular level, at
the cellar level many times, and I think the physiotherapists out
there and the rest of you who are involved in sports medicine and some
of the physicians will say, "Well, of course that makes perfect
sense," but oftentimes this is not what happens. Oftentimes what
happens is it's all about resting and limiting inflammation, et
cetera, of the injured limb or the limbs corresponding to the injured
part of the brain, and these experiments and the collection of them
point to the fact that the balance between the right and left side of
our body is always dynamic. It's always being updated at the level of
neural circuitry, the Ramachandran studies with the mirror box support
that too, and that even slight imbalances in the two sides of the body
can get amplified, and so when you're in a situation where one side is
injured or the brain is injured representing one side of the body, the
key thing to do is to really overwork the side that needs the work and
to restrict the activity of the side that doesn't need the work
because it's healthy, and this has great semblance to ocular dominance
plasticity, which I talked about a couple episodes ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=2100"&gt;Don’t Over Compensate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't go into it in detail, but where the Nobel Prize winning
neurobiologists Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel showed that if one eye
is closed early in development, that the representation of the
opposite eye in the brain is completely overtaken by the intact eye.
This is important. It means that all of our senses and our movements
are competing for space in our brain and so the way to think about the
principle is anytime you're injured and you're hobbling along, you
don't want to injure yourself further, but you want to try and
compensate in the ways that respect this competition for neural real
estate, and what that usually means is not relying on where you're
still strong because that's just going to create runaway plasticity
that's going to make it very hard for you to recover the motor
function, and in some cases, the sensory function, of the damaged
limb. Some of you may be wondering how long and how often one should
restrict the activity of the intact or healthy limb, or limbs in some
cases, and the answer is you don't have to do that all day, every day.
These experiments centered on doing one or two hours of dedicated
work, sensory motor work or, so for instance, if you had a sprained
ankle on the left, you might spend part of the day where your left
leg, provided it's not too painful, can be exercised, again, in a way
that's not damaging to the injury, and the right limb can't contribute
to that exercise. This might be peddling unilaterally on a stationary
bike if you can do that. For a different type of limb injury, like an
arm injury, this might be reaching, provided the shoulder is mobile,
doing reaching. It might be even writing with the damaged side and
then intentionally not writing with the preferred or undamaged side.
This has been shown to accelerate the central plasticity and the
recovery of function, which I think is what most people want when
people are injured. They want to get back to doing what they were
doing previously and they want to be able to do that without pain.
This brings up another topic, which is definitely related to
neuroplasticity and injury but is a more general one that I hear about
a lot, which is traumatic brain injury. Many injuries are not just
about the limb and the lack of use of the limb but concussion and head
injury, and I want to emphasize I'm not a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=2254"&gt;Concussion, TBI &amp;amp; Brain Ageing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many colleagues that are. At some point, we will do a whole
month on TBI because it's such a serious issue and it's such a huge
discussion, but I want to talk a little bit about what is known about
recovery from concussion, and this is very important because it has
implications for just normal aging as well and offsetting some of the
cognitive decline and physical decline that occurs with normal aging.
We shouldn't think of TBI as just for the football players or just for
the kids that had an injury or just for the person that was in the car
accident. We want to learn about TBI and understand TBI for those
folks, but we're also going to talk about TBI as it relates to general
degradation of brain function because there's a certain resemblance
there of TBI to general brain aging. Typically after TBI, there are a
number of different things that happen and there are a huge range of
things that can create TBI. Neurologists and the emergency room
physicians are going to want to know was the skull itself injured or
did the brain rattle around in the skull? Was there actually a breach
through the skull? Is there a physical object in there? How many
concussions has the person had? Everyone's situation with TBI is
incredibly different, but there's a constellation of symptoms that
many people, if not all people with TBI, report which is headache,
photophobia, that lights become aversive, sleep disruption, trouble
concentrating, sometimes mood issues. There's a huge range and of
course the severity will vary, et cetera. In a previous episode, I
mentioned the Kennard Principle. The Kennard Principle, named after
the famous neurologist, named by and after the famous neurologist
Margaret Kennard, said that if you're going to get a brain injury,
better to get it early in life than later in life and that's because
the brain has a much greater or heightened capacity for repairing
itself early in life than later, but of course, none of us want TBI
and you can't pick when you get your TBI. You can avoid certain
activities that would give you TBI, but really, when it comes to TBI,
there are a couple of things that are agreed upon across the board.
The first one is, as much as possible you want to avoid a second
traumatic brain injury or concussion. That's going to be a tough one
for some of the athletes and even recreational athletes to swallow
because they want to continue in their sport, and I'm not here to tell
you that you should or you shouldn't, but that's simply the way that
it is. For folks that are in military or that are in certain
professions, construction is a place where we see a lot of TBI. It's
not always just football. A lot of construction workers are dealing
with heavy objects swinging around in space. They wear those hardhat
helmets, which unfortunately don't protect much against a lot of those
blunt forces and certainly not against falls and things of that sort.
Many people, in order to survive and feed their families, have to go
back to work. It's very clear that regardless of whether or not there
was a skull break and regardless of when the TBI happened and how many
times it's happened, that the system that repairs the brain, the adult
brain, is mainly centered around this lymphatic system that we call,
for the brain, the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=2449"&gt;The Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain wasn't thought to have a lymphatic system. It wasn't thought
to have circulating immune cells, but about 10 years ago it was sort
of rediscovered because if you look in the literature you realize this
stuff was around longer, that there's a glymphatic system. It's sort
of like a sewer system that clears out the debris that surrounds
neurons, especially injured neurons, and the glymphatic system is very
active during sleep. It's been imaged in functional magnetic resonance
imaging and the glymphatic system is something that you want very
active because it's going to clear away the debris that sits between
the neurons, and the cells that surround the connections between the
neurons, called the glia, those cells are actively involved in
repairing the connections between neurons when damaged. The glymphatic
system is so important that many people, if not all people who get
TBI, are told, "Get adequate rest, you need to sleep," and that's kind
of twofold advice. On the one hand, it's telling you to get sleep
because all these good things happen in sleep. It's also about getting
those people to not continue to engage in their activity full time or
really try and hammer through it. You might say, "Well, if you have
trouble sleeping, how are you supposed to get deep sleep?" Most of the
activity of the glymphatic system, this wash out of the debris, is
occurring during slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep, as I mentioned in a
previous episode, is something that happens typically in the early
part of the evening. Even for those of you that are falling, or early
part of the night, rather, if you're falling asleep and then waking up
three, four hours later, it's important that you continue to get sleep
but know that the slow-wave sleep is mainly packed toward the early
part of the night, so that hopefully will alleviate some of the
anxiety of the 3:00 and 4:00 am wake up, although you really should
follow some of the protocols that I've suggested and your physician's
protocols in order to try and get regular, longer sleep of seven,
eight hours. Later, we're going to talk about the eight-hour mark as a
prerequisite for repair. The glymphatic system has been shown to be
activated further in two ways. One is that sleeping on one side, not
on back or stomach,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=2585"&gt;Body Position &amp;amp; Angle During Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seems to increase the amount of wash out, or wash through, I should
say, of the glymphatic system. There aren't a ton of data on this, but
the data that exist are pretty solid. Again, sleeping on one side or
with feet slightly elevated, as well, has been shown to increase the
rate of clearance of some of the debris and that's because the way
that the glymphatic system works is it has a physical pressure fluid
dynamic to it that allow it to work more efficiently when one is
sleeping on their side or with feet slightly elevated. This means not
falling asleep in a chair while watching TV. This means, if possible,
not falling asleep on one's back or on one's stomach, sleeping on
one's side, and if you can't do that, I don't really like to sleep on
my side. I sleep with my feet slightly elevated. I put a thin pillow
under my ankles. I don't have TBI, but I have had a few concussions
before, but right now I feel fine, but I find that putting the pillow
under my ankles helps me sleep much more deeply and I wake up feeling
much more refreshed. The other thing that has been shown to improve
the function of the glymphatic system, and this is, again, is for sake
of TBI as well as for everyone, even without brain injury, is a
certain form of exercise, and I want to be very, very clear here. I
will never and I am not suggesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=2670"&gt;Types of Exercise For Restoring &amp;amp; Maintaining Brain Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that people exercise in any way that aggravates their injury or that
goes against their physician's advice. Take your physician's advice as
to whether or not you should be exercising at all and how much and
then to what intensity. However, there's some interesting data, and we
can provide a link to the review on this. It shows that exercise of
what I guess people would nowadays call it Zone 2 cardio, which is
low-level cardio that one could do while talking to somebody else. You
could maintain a conversation, although you don't have to talk to
somebody else. It just gives you a sense of the intensity of the
exercise. That Zone 2 cardio for 30 to 45 minutes 3 times a week seems
to improve the rates of clearance of some of the debris after injury,
and in general, injury or no, to accelerate and improve the rates of
flow for the glymphatic system. I find this really interesting because
I think nowadays there's such an obsession with high-intensity
interval training and people trying to pack in as much as they can
into a short workout, which is great if it brings people to the table
who haven't been exercising before, but I think it's really important
that we know that the data on exercise and its relationship to brain
health speak to doing 30 to 45 minutes of this what we call low-level
cardio. It could be fast walking. It could be jogging if you can do
that with your injury safely. It could be cycling. This is not the
kind of workout that's designed to get your heart rate up to the point
where you're improving your fitness levels at some sort of massive
rate or taking huge jumps in your VO2 max or anything like that. This
is exercise, I do this and I know a number of other people, especially
people in communities where there is a lot of TBI, are now starting to
adopt this, that the 30 to 45 minutes 3 times a week or so, could be
more, of this Zone 2 type cardio can be very beneficial for washout of
debris from the brain, and this is really interesting outside of TBI
because what we know from aging is that aging is a nonlinear process.
It's not like with every year of life your brain gets a little older.
Sometimes it follows what's more like a step function where you get
these big jumps in markers of aging. I guess that we could think of
them as jumps down because it's a negative thing for most everybody.
We'd like to live longer and be healthier in brain and body, and so
the types of exercise I'm referring to now are really more about brain
longevity and about keeping the brain healthy than they are about
physical fitness. There's no reason why you couldn't do this and also,
provided, again, it's safe for you given your brain state and injury
state, et cetera, there's no reason why you couldn't also combine it
with weight training and other forms of cardio. I think this is really
interesting and if some of you would like to know the mechanism or at
least the hypothesized mechanism, there's a molecule called
aquaporin-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=2853"&gt;Ambulance Cells in The Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It almost sounds like the fourth in a sequel of movies or something
like that, but aquaporin-4 is a molecule that is related to the glial
system. Glia are the, it means glue in Latin, are these cells in the
brain, the most numerous cells in the brain, in fact, that ensheathe
synapses, but they're very dynamic cells. They're like little ambulant
cells. The microglia will run in and will gather up debris and soak it
up and then run out after an injury. Aquaporin-4 is mainly expressed
by the glial cell called the astrocyte. Astro, it looks like a little
star. Incredibly interesting cells and the thing to remember is that
the astrocytes bridge the connection between the neurons, the synapse,
the connections between them, and the vasculature, the blood system,
and the glymphatic system. They sit at the interface and they kind of,
imagine somebody on an emergency site, car crash site, who's directing
everybody around as to what to do. Get that person on a stretcher,
bandage them up, call their mother, et cetera, et cetera, get this out
of the road, put down some flares. The astrocytes work in that
capacity as well as doing some things more directly. This glymphatic
system and the glial astrocyte system is a system that we want
chronically active throughout the day as much as possible, so low-
level walking, Zone 2 cardio, and then at night, during slow-wave
sleep, is then really when this glymphatic system kicks in. That
should hopefully be an actionable takeaway, provided that you can do
that kind of cardio safely, that I believe everybody should be doing
who cares about brain longevity, not just people who are trying to get
over TBI. Now I'd like to return a little bit to some of the
subjective aspects of pain modulation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=2960"&gt;True Pain Control by Belief and Context&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because I think it's so interesting and so actionable that everyone
should know about this, and in this case, we can also say that
regardless of whether or not you're experiencing pain, acute or
chronic, what I'm about to tell you is as close as anything is to
proof, in science, we rarely talk about proof, we talk about evidence
in favor or against a hypothesis, but as close as possible to proof
that our interpretation, our subjective interpretation of a sensory
event is immensely powerful for dictating our experience of the event.
Here are a couple examples. First of all, anyone who's ever done
combat sports or martial arts knows that it's incredible how little a
punch hurts during a fight and it's incredible how much it hurts after
a fight. The molecule adrenaline, when it's liberated into our body,
truly blunts our experience of pain. We all know the stories of people
walking miles on stumped legs, people doing all sorts of things that
were incredible feats that allowed them to move through what would
otherwise be pain, and afterward they do experience extreme pain, but
during the event oftentimes they are not experiencing pain and that's
because of the pain-blunting effects of adrenaline. I'll tell you
exactly how this works in a few minutes when we talk about
acupuncture, but norepinephrine binding to particular receptors,
adrenaline binding to particular receptors actually shuts down pain
pathways. People who anticipate an injection of morphine immediately
report the feeling of loss of pain. Their pain starts to diminish
because they know they're going to get pain relief and it's a powerful
effect. All of you are probably saying placebo effect. Placebo effects
are very real. Placebo effects and belief effects, as they're called,
have a profound effect on our experience of noxious stimuli like pain
and they can also have a profound effect on positive stimuli and
things that we're looking forward to. One study that I think is
particularly interesting here, it's from my colleague at Stanford,
Sean Mackey. They did a neuroimaging study. They subjected people to
pain. In this case, it was a heat pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=3105"&gt;Romantic Love and Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have very specific thresholds to heat at which they cannot
tolerate any more heat, but they explored the extent to which looking
at an image of somebody, in this case, a romantic partner that the
person loved, would allow them to adjust their pain response, and it
turns out it does. If people are looking at an image or thinking about
a person that they love, or even a thing that they love, a pet that
they love, studies previous to the one that Mackey and colleagues did
showed that their experience of pain was reduced. Their threshold for
pain was higher. They could tolerate more pain and they reported it as
not as painful, but there's a twist there which is it turns out that
the extent to which love will modulate pain has everything to do with
how infatuated and obsessed somebody is with the object of their love.
People that report thinking about somebody, or a pet, for many hours
of the day, kind of having an obsessive nature, almost like what
people might call quote, unquote, codependency. For those of you that
are listening, I'm just providing air quotes 'cause codependency is
kind of a clinical thing now although it's thrown around a lot all the
time. It's sort of like gaslighting. People talk about gaslighting all
the time now. Gaslighting is a real thing but then people talked about
gaslighting for many things outside the clinical description. If
people are very obsessed with somebody, they have a kind of obsessive
love of somebody's face, even if the other person doesn't know them,
which is a little weird, that response, that feeling of love
internally can blunt the pain experience to a significant degree.
These are not small effects. It's not just that love can protect us
from pain. It's that infatuation and obsession can protect us from
pain, and not surprisingly, how early a relationship is, how new a
relationship is directly correlates with people's ability, they
showed, to use this love, this internal representation of love, to
blunt the pain response. For those of you that have been with your
partners for many years and you love them very much and you're
obsessed with them, terrific. You have a pre-installed, well, I
suppose it's not pre-installed. You had to do the work because
relationships are work, but you've got a installed mechanism for
blunting pain, and again, these are not minor effects. These are major
effects and it's all going to be through that top-down modulation that
we talked about, not unlike the mirror box experiments with phantom
limb that relieve phantom pain or some other top-down modulation, and
the opposite example was the nail through the boot, which is a visual
image that made the person think it was painful when in fact it was
painful even though there was no tissue damage. It was all perceptual.
The pain system is really subject to these perceptual influences,
which is remarkable because, really, when we think about the
somatosensory system, it has this cognitive component, it's got this
peripheral component, but there's another component which is the way
in which our sensation, our somatosensory system is woven in with our
autonomic nervous system, and we're going to get to that next, but I
want to just raise the idea that the reason that this kind of
infatuation and obsessive love can blunt the pain response and
increase one's threshold for pain may have to do, I would say almost
certainly has to do, but it hasn't been measured yet, with dopamine
release because dopamine is absolutely the molecule that's liberated
in our brain and body when there's a new kind of obsession or
infatuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=3305"&gt;Dopaminergic Control of Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very distinct from the kind of love chemicals, if you will, I
don't even like calling them love chemicals. That just feels weird. If
this were text, I would delete that line, but from the chemicals
associated with warmth and connection, such as serotonin and oxytocin,
which tend to be for more stable, long-lasting relationships. Dopamine
is what dilates the pupils, which gets people really excited. They
can't stop thinking about somebody. The text messages are even
exciting. They write to them and they can't wait for the text message
to come back, the dot dot dot on the screen. The text message is
excruciating. They don't respond for two minutes and people are
getting flipped out. I'm not here to support that kind of whatever,
what I'm saying is that that obsessive type of love, which without
question is going to be associated with the dopamine pathway, does
seem to have a utility in the context of reducing the unpleasantness
of physical pain, and probably has a lot to do with reducing the
unpleasantness of a lot of life, like sitting in traffic, et cetera,
because when we talk about pain, emotional pain and physical pain
start to become one in the same. They are so closely intertwined that
the lines between them neurally become very blurry. What do I mean by
that? Well, if love and infatuation can reduce pain, presumably
through the release of dopamine, well, then does dopamine release
itself blunt pain? Should we be chasing dopamine release as a way to
treat chronic and acute pain? And that's exactly what we're going to
talk about now. Independent of love, we're going to talk about
something quite different which is putting needles and electricity in
different parts of the body, so-called acupuncture. Something that,
for many people,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=3435"&gt;Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's been viewed as a kind of alternative medicine, but now there are
excellent laboratories exploring what's called electroacupuncture and
acupuncture. These are big university centers. In fact, my source for
everything I'm about to tell you next is Professor Qiufu Ma at Harvard
Medical School and his papers. I stand behind the information that I'm
going to provide today, but it's extracted largely from the Ma lab's
papers which use very rigorous variable-isolating experiments to
address just how does something like acupuncture work, and I think
what you'll be interested in and surprised to learn is that it does
work, but sometimes it can exacerbate pain and sometimes it can
relieve pain and it all does that through very discrete pathways for
which we can really say, "This neuron connects to that neuron connects
to the adrenals," and we can tie this all back to dopamine because in
the end it's the chemicals and neural circuits that are giving rise to
these perceptions, or these experiences, rather, of things that we
call pain, love, et cetera. In a previous podcast episode, I mentioned
my experience of visiting an acupuncturist and getting acupuncture.
The acupuncture itself didn't really do that much for me, but I wasn't
there for any specific reason. It was gifted to me by somebody and I
wanted to try it. I'm not passing judgment on acupuncture. In fact, I
know a number of people that really derive tremendous benefit from
acupuncture for pain and for gastrointestinal issues. There are
actually a lot of really good peer-reviewed studies supporting the use
of acupuncture for, in particular, GI tract issues. In recent years,
there's been an emphasis on trying to understand the mechanism of
things like acupuncture and acupuncture itself, not to support
acupuncture or to try to get everybody to do acupuncture but as a way
to try and understand how these sorts of practices might actually
benefit people who are experiencing pain or for changing the nervous
system or brain-body relationship in general, and actually, the
National Institutes of Health in the United States now has a entire
subdivision, an institute within the National Institutes of Health,
which is complementary health, and that institute is interested in
things like acupuncture and a variety of other practices that, I
think, 10, 15 years ago people probably thought were really
alternative and maybe even counterculture, at least in the States, and
it's exciting. I think people are starting to really take a look at
what's going on under the hood for certain types of treatments that
are very useful and I think it's very likely to lead to an expanded
number of treatments for a number of different conditions. What I want
to talk about in terms of acupuncture is the incredible way in which
acupuncture illuminates the crosstalk between the somatosensory
system, our ability to feel stuff externally, exteroception,
internally, interoception, and how that somatosensory system is wired
in with and communicating with our autonomic nervous system that
regulates our levels of alertness or calmness. After that, I'm going
to talk about how the acupuncture that's being done right now also
points to relief for what's called referred pain. This takes us all
back to the homunculus. Let's start there. We have this representation
of our body surface in our brain. That representation is what we call
somatotopic, and what somatotopy is is it just means that areas of
your body that are near one another, so your thumb and your
forefinger, for instance, are represented by neurons that are nearby
each other in the brain. You might say, "Well, duh," but actually, it
didn't have to be that way. The neurons that represent the tip of my
forefinger and the neurons that represent my thumb on the same hand
could have been distantly located and therefore the map of my body
surface, the homunculus, would be really disordered, but it's not that
way. It's very ordered. It's very smooth. As, let's say you were to
image my brain, if you were to stimulate my finger, my forefinger, and
then march that stimulation across my finger, across the palm and to
the nearby thumb, you would see that neurons in the brain would also
make a sort of J shape in their pattern of activation. That means
there's so-called somatotopy, but the connections from those brain
neurons are sent into the body and they are synchronized with, meaning
they cross-wire with and form synapses with some of the input from the
viscera, from our guts, from our diaphragm, from our stomach, from our
spleen, from our heart. Our internal organs are sending information up
to this map in our brain of the body surface, but it's about internal
information, what we call interoception, our ability to look inside or
imagine inside and feel what we're feeling inside. The way to think
about this accurately is that our representation of ourself is a
representation of our internal workings, our viscera, our guts,
everything inside our skin, and the surface of our skin, and the
external world, what we're seeing. Those three things are always being
combined in a very interesting, complex but very seamless way.
Acupuncture involves taking needles, and sometimes electricity and or
heat as well, and stimulating particular locations on the body and
through these maps of stimulation that have been developed over
thousands of years, mostly in Asia, but now this is a practice that's
being done many places throughout the world, they have these maps that
speak to, oh, well, if you stimulate this part of the body, you get
this response, and if somebody has a gastrointestinal issue, like
their guts are moving too quick, they have diarrhea, you stimulate
this area and it'll slow their gut motility down, or if their gut
motility is too slow, they're constipated, you stimulate someplace
else and it accelerates it, and hearing about this stuff, it sounds
kind of, to a Westerner who's not thinking about the underlying neural
circuitry, it could sound kind of wacky. It really sounds like
alternative or even really out there stuff, but when you look at the
neural circuitry, the neuroanatomy, it really starts to make sense,
and Qiufu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School is an excellent
laboratory, has been exploring how stimulation of different types,
intense or weak, with heat or without heat, on different parts of the
body can modulate pain and inflammation, and what they've shown in a
particularly exciting study is that stimulation of the abdomen,
anywhere on the midsection, weakly does nothing. "Well, that's not
very interesting," you might say. Intense stimulation of the abdomen,
however, with this electroacupuncture has a very strong effect of
increasing inflammation in the body, and this is important to
understand because it's not just that stimulating the gut does this
because you're activating the gut area. It activates a particular
nerve pathway. For the aficionados, it's the splenic spinal
sympathetic axis if you really want to know, and it's pro-inflammatory
under most conditions. However, there are other conditions where if,
for instance, the person is dealing with a particular bacterial
infection, that can be beneficial, and this goes back to a much
earlier discussion that we had on a previous podcast that we'll
revisit again and again, which is that the stress response was
designed to combat infection. It turns out that there are certain
patterns of stimulation on the abdomen that can actually liberate
immune cells from our immune organs, like our spleen, and counter
infection through the release of things like adrenaline. Qiufu's lab
also showed that stimulation of the feet and hands can reduce
inflammation, and again, this was done mechanistically. This was done
by blocking certain pathways with the appropriate control experiments.
This was done not in any kind of subjective way. This was also done by
measuring particular molecules, IL-6 and cytokines and things that are
related to the inflammation response, and what they showed is that the
stimulation of the, in particular, the hind limbs at low intensity led
to increases in the activity of this vagal pathway. The vagus nerve
being this 10th cranial nerve that serves the rest and digest and
parasympathetic, in other words, calming response. What this means is
that we are now at the front edge of this research field that's, it's
early days still, but it's discovering that depending on whether or
not the stimulation is intense or mild and depending on where the
stimulation is done on the body you can get very different effects.
This points to the idea that you can't say acupuncture good or
acupuncture bad. There has to be a systematic understanding of what
exactly the effect is that you're trying to achieve and the underlying
basis for this is really relevant to the thing about adrenaline that I
said before, that in a fight, it's rare that you ever feel pain when
you get hit, I've experienced that, but later it hurts a lot. It turns
out that when you stimulate these pathways that activate, in
particular, the adrenals, the adrenal gland liberates norepinephrine
and epinephrine and the brain does as well, it binds to what are
called the beta noradrenergic receptors. This is really getting down
into the weeds, but the beta noradrenergic receptors activate the
spleen which liberates cells that combat infection and it's anti-
inflammatory. That's the short-term quick response. The more intense
stimulation of the abdomen and other areas can be pro-inflammatory
because of the ways that they trigger certain loops that go back to
the brain and trigger the anxiety pathways and that place people into
a state of anxiety that exacerbates pain. One pathway stimulates
norepinephrine and blunts pain, the other one doesn't. What does all
this mean? How are we supposed to put all of this together? Well,
there's a paper that was published&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=4052"&gt;Vagus Activation and Autonomic Control of Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in "Nature Medicine" in 2014, this is an excellent journal, that
describes how dopamine can activate the vagus peripherally in the, not
dopamine in the brain, peripherally, and norepinephrine can activate
the vagus peripherally and reduce inflammation, and I'm not trying to
throw a ton of facts at you. You'll say, "Well, what am I supposed to
do with all this information?" What this means is that there are real
maps of our body surface that when stimulated communicate with our
autonomic nervous system, the system that controls alertness or
calmness, and thereby releases either molecules like norepinephrine
and dopamine, which make us more alert, as we would be in a fight, and
blunt our response to pain and they reduce inflammation, but there are
yet other pathways that when stimulated are pro-inflammatory, and that
brings us to the question of what is all this inflammation stuff that
people are talking about? One of the things that bothers me so much
these days,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=4110"&gt;Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead and DHT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I'm not easily irritated, but what really bothers me is when
people are talking about inflammation like inflammation is bad.
Inflammation is terrific. Inflammation is the reason why cells are
called to the site of injury to clear it out. Inflammation is what's
going to allow you to heal from any injury. Chronic inflammation is
bad, but acute inflammation is absolutely essential. Remember those
kids that we talked about earlier that have mutations in these
receptors for sensing pain? They never get inflammation and that's why
their joints literally disintegrate. It's really horrible because they
don't actually have the inflammation response because it was never
triggered by the pain response. Inflammation can be very beneficial.
There's a lot of interest nowadays in taking things and doing things
to limit inflammation. One of the ones that comes up a lot is
turmeric. I'm sure the moment anyone starts talking about inflammation
the question is, "What about turmeric?" I have talked before about
turmeric elsewhere. I am very skeptical of turmeric and I might lose a
few friends, although that'd be weird if my friend, that would say
something about my friendships if I lost friends over a discussion
about turmeric, but in any case, turmeric does have anti-inflammatory
properties, there's no question about that, but as we've just
described, inflammation can be a very good thing, at least in the
short term. The other thing about turmeric is there was a study
published out of Stanford in collection with some work from other
universities showing that a lot of turmeric is heavily contaminated
with lead. The lead is used to get that really rich, dense, orange
coloring to it that everyone wants to see, so you have to check your
sources of turmeric. The other thing is, for men in particular,
turmeric can be very antagonistic to dihydrotestosterone.
Dihydrotestosterone is the more dominant form of androgen in human
males and it's involved in things like aggression and libido and
things of that sort. Many people that I've talked to who have have
taken turmeric get a severe blunting of affect and libido. For some
people that might be a serious negative. I certainly avoid turmeric. I
don't like turmeric for that reason. I also think that the
inflammation response is a healthy response. You have to keep it in
check and we're going to talk about specific practices for wound
healing and injury in a moment, but this idea that just inflammation
is bad and you want to reduce inflammation across the board, nothing
could be further from the truth. We have pathways that exist in our
body specifically to increase inflammation. It's the inflammation that
goes unchecked, just like stress, which is problematic for repair, for
brain injury, and it can exacerbate certain forms of dementia, et
cetera, but I'd like to create a little bit more nuance or a lot more
nuance, if possible, in the conversation around inflammation because
people have just taken this discussion around inflammation to be this
idea that just inflammation is bad and nothing could be further from
the truth. Before I continue, I just thought I'd answer a question
that I get a lot which is what about Wim Hof breathing? I get asked
about this a lot. Wim Hof, also called aka The Iceman,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=4300"&gt;Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;has this breathing that's similar to Tummo breathing, as it was
originally called, involves basically hyperventilating and then doing
some exhales and some breath holds. A couple of things about that. It
should never be done near water. People who have done it near water
unfortunately have drowned. It's certainly not for everybody and I'm
not here to either promote it nor discourage people from doing it, but
I think we should ask ourselves, "What is the net effect of that?"
Because a number of people have asked me about it in relation to pain
management. The effect of doing that kind of breathing, it's not a
mysterious effect. It liberates adrenaline from the adrenals. There is
a paper published in the "Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences," which is a very fine journal, showing that that breathing
pattern can counter infection from endotoxin and that's because when
you have adrenaline in your system and when the spleen is very active,
that response is used to counter infection and stress counters
infection. We'll talk about this more going forward, but the idea that
stress lends itself to infection is false. Stress counters infection
by liberating killer cells in the body. You don't want the stress
response to stay on indefinitely, however. Things like Wim Hof
breathing, like ice baths, anything that releases adrenaline will
counter the infection, but you want to regulate the duration of that
adrenaline response. This should make perfect sense. We, as a species,
had to evolve under conditions of famine and cold. Actually, Texas
right now is an extreme case of cold and power outage. I've seen the
pictures and a lot of people out there are really suffering. Their
systems are releasing a ton of adrenaline. They're cold. Some of them
are likely to be hungry. They're probably stressed. They're releasing
a lot of adrenaline which is keeping them safe from infection. After
they get their heat back on and they relax and they can finally warm
up again, which we would like for them very soon, hopefully by the
time this podcast comes out, that will have already happened, that's
typically when people get sick because the immune response is blunted
as the stress response starts to subside. Stress, inflammation,
countering infection, that comes from endotoxin, that comes from any
number of things. It can be from cold. It can be from
hyperventilation. It can be from a physical threat. It can be from the
stress of an exam or an upcoming surgery. This adrenaline thing and
the inflammation associated with it is adaptive. It's highly adaptive.
It is a short-term plasticity that is designed to make us better for
what we're experiencing and challenged with, not worse, and so
hopefully that will add an additional layer to this whole idea that
stress is bad, inflammation is bad, et cetera. Again, I'm not
suggesting people do or don't do something like Wim Hof, Tummo
breathing, I just want to point to the utility. It's very similar to
the utility from cold showers, ice baths and other forms of anything
that increase adrenaline. Every episode, I want to make sure that
every listener comes away with as much knowledge as possible but also
actionable tools, and today we've talked about a variety of tools, but
I want to center in on a particular sequence of tools that hopefully
you won't need, but presumably if you're a human being and you're
active, you will need at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=4493"&gt;Protocols For Accelerating Tissue Repair &amp;amp; Managing Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's about managing injury and recovering and healing fast or at least
as fast as possible. It includes removing the pain. It includes
getting mobility back and getting back to a normal life, whatever that
means for you. I want to emphasize that what I'm about to talk about
next was developed in close consultation with Kelly Starrett, who many
of you probably have heard of before. Kelly can be found at The Ready
State. He's a formally trained, so degreed and educated, exercise
physiologist. He's a world expert in movement and tissue
rehabilitation, et cetera. They're not sponsors of the podcast. Kelly
is a friend and a colleague. He's somebody that I personally trust and
his views on tissue rehabilitation and injury I think are really
grounded extremely well in both medicine, physiology, and the real
cutting edge of what's new and what you might not get in terms of
advice from the typical person. All that said, you always, always,
always should consult with your physician before adopting any
protocols or removing any protocols. I asked Kelly, I made it really
simple, I said, "Okay, let's say I were to sprain my ankle or break my
arm or injure my knee or ACL tear or something like that or shoulder
injury, what are the absolute necessary things to do regardless of
situation and what science is this grounded in?" And then I made it a
point to go find the studies that either supported or refuted what he
was telling me because that's why I'm here. The first one is a very
basic one, that now you have a lot of information to act on, which is
in terms of what we know about tissue rehabilitation, both brain and
body, we know that sleep is essential, and so we both agreed that
eight hours minimum in bed per night is critical. What was
interesting, however, is that it doesn't have to be eight hours of
sleep. We acknowledged that some of that time might be challenging to
get to sleep, especially if one is in pain or mobility is limited. We
forget how often we roll over in bed or how the conditions of our
sleeping can impact those injuries too. Kelly acknowledged, and I
agree, that eight hours of sleep would be ideal, but if not, at least
eight hours immobile and that speaks to the power of these non-sleep
deep rest protocols too. If you can't sleep, doing non-sleep deep rest
protocols, we've provided links to them before, we're going to
continue to provide links to the previous ones and new ones are coming
soon, that is extremely beneficial. That's a non-negotiable in terms
of getting the foundation for allowing for glymphatic clearance and
tissue clearance, et cetera. The other is, if possible, unless it's
absolutely excruciating or you just can't do it, a 10-minute walk per
day, of course you don't want to exacerbate the injury, at least a
10-minute walk per day and probably longer. This is where it gets
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=4675"&gt;Ice Is Not Always Nice (For Pain and Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taught, I learned that when you injure yourself, you're supposed
to ice something. You're supposed to put ice on it, but I didn't
realize this, but when speaking to exercise physiologists and some
physicians, they said that the ice is really more of a placebo. It
numbs the environment of the injury, which is not surprising, and will
eliminate the pain for a short while, but it has some negative effects
that perhaps offset its use. One, it sludges, it creates sludging
within the blood and other lymphatic tissue, so it actually can create
some clotting and sludging of the tissue and fluids, the fascial
interface with muscle, and a number of the stuff that's supposed to be
flowing through there can slow up and increase inflammation in the
wrong way, can actually restrict movement out of the injury site,
which is bad because you want the macrophages and the other cell types
phagocytosing, eating up, the debris in an injury and moving it out of
there so that it can repair. That was surprising to me which made me
ask, "Well, then what about heat?" Well, it turns out heat is actually
quite beneficial. A lot of people talk about heat shock proteins and
all these genetic pathways and protein pathways that can be activated
by heat. Very little data to support the idea that heat shock proteins
are part of the wound healing process, at least in terms of the sorts
of conventional heat that one could use like a hot water bottle or a
hot bath or a hot compress. The major effects seem to be explained by
heat improving the viscosity of the tissues and the clearance and the
perfusion of fluid, blood, lymph and other fluids, out of the injury
area. That's really interesting. I didn't know this. I thought, well,
you're supposed to ice something. I said, well, whenever I would see a
kid get injured in soccer, never me, of course, no, of course I got
injured in soccer from time to time, they give you an ice pack and the
ice pack removes some of the pain. I think the consensus now, which
was surprising to me, is that the ice pack is actually more of the
top-down modulation. You think you're doing something for the pain and
there's some interesting studies that actually showed the placebo
effect of the ice pack, so ice packs are placebo, perhaps. That's
interesting. I'll underline perhaps because who knows? Maybe there's
some people out there that are going to say this is totally crazy and
the ice is actually very beneficial, but it seems like heat, mobility,
sleep, keeping movement, and it turns out that the movement itself can
act as a bit of an analgesic, it can actually reduce the pain, whereas
the ice reduces the pain but sludges the tissue and keeps the cells
that need to be removed from leaving the area. What's also interesting
is in neuroscience we know that if we want to kill neurons or silence
neurons, we cool them. This is a well-known tool in the laboratory.
Some of the early and most important studies in neuroscience that
formed the basis for the textbooks were lowering a cooling probe into
a particular area of the brain or a peripheral nerve in order to shut
down that nerve, so the cooling will shut down the nerve, but another
very well-known fact in neuroscience text books is that when the
activity of the nerve pathway or neurons comes back, there's what's
called homeostatic plasticity, that it rebounds with greater pain,
with a higher level of intensity, which in the pain system would
equate to greater pain. Regardless of where these neurons are in the
body, if you stimulate a neuron, it's active. If you cool it, it
becomes inactive and when the neuron heats back up after being cooled,
it becomes hyperactive, and so this makes really good sense as to why
heat, provided it's not damaging levels of heat, would be more
beneficial for wound healing and for reducing pain in the short and
long run than would be cold or ice, which I find very interesting. In
terms of chronic pain, the manuscripts on this, my discussion with
Kelly and with others, point to the fact that chronic pain is
basically plasticity gone wrong. It's sort of like PTSD for the
emotional system and the stress system, and chronic pain is going to
involve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=4922"&gt;Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a number of different protocols to rewire both the brain centers and
the peripheral centers associated with chronic pain. Certain things
like fibromyalgia, for instance, which is whole-body pain, relate to
too little inhibition. In the brain, you have excitation and
inhibition. They come from different sources of neurons. The
inhibition is mainly from GABA and glycine and things like that. In
fibromyalgia, there's too little central, within the brain, modulation
of the pain responses so that people experience whole-body pain. In
that case, the emerging therapies are really interesting. I have a
friend who works for the National Institutes of Health who
unfortunately suffers from fibromyalgia who asked me about this a lot
and his question and what he's now actually exploring is red light
therapy. Something that I've talked about on various Instagram posts.
Red light therapy typically is talked about in terms of mitochondria
and the data on that are not so terrific, at least not really
published in blue ribbon journals in most cases, except for one study
that I'm aware of from Glen Jeffery's lab at University College London
showing that red light stimulation to the eyes in people 40 or older
can offset some of the effects of macular degeneration by improving
the health of the photo receptors. People with fibromyalgia, which is
this whole-body pain, are now starting to use red light therapies.
When I asked Kelly and others and some experts in pain, "What are your
thoughts on this red light therapy for things like fibromyalgia and
pain, especially red light local therapy?" Their idea, and I don't
think this is a field that's progressed far enough now to really place
any firm conclusions on, but the idea is that red light therapy
locally may have some effect, but the systemic red light therapy, this
is like wearing protection to the eyes, in some cases, so not for the
treatment of macular degeneration but wearing protection of the eyes
and getting very bright red light therapy in many ways may be, and to
use Kelly's words, "Approximating the effects of nature." These are
like surrogate technologies for getting outside in the sunshine. When
you're in the sun, it might not look red, but there are a lot of red
wavelengths coming toward you. The red light therapies may have some
utility, but getting into sunlight may actually have as much or more
effect. Of course, if these wounds are on a part of the body that you
can't expose, then you could imagine why the red light therapy might
be good. I don't know, depending on the neighborhood you live in, that
may or may not be a weird thing to go outside and expose your body to
sunlight. Probably a number of factors that dictate whether or not
that'd be weird or not, but that's up to you, not me, and it seems
that, so movement, heat, not ice, light, sleep, and in some cases, the
use, and I'll talk about this in a moment, that some cases the use of
restricting above and below the injury to then release and then
increase perfusion through the site may actually accelerate the wound
healing. All of this might sound just like common sense knowledge, but
to me, at least as a 45-year-old, I always just thought it's ice, it's
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, it's things that block
prostaglandins, so things like aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen.
Those things generally work by blocking things, they're called the COX
prostaglandin blockers and things of that sort, things in that
pathway. Those sorts of treatments which reduce inflammation may not
be so great at the beginning when you want inflammation, they may be
important for limiting pain so people can be functional at all, but
the things that I talked about today really are anchored in three
principles. One is that the inflammation response is a good one. This
is what we're learning from Qiufu Ma's lab's work on acupuncture. The
immediate acute inflammation response is good. It calls to the site of
injury things that are going to clean up the injury and bad cells.
Then there are going to be things that are going to improve perfusion,
like the glymphatic system, getting deep sleep, feet elevated,
sleeping on one side, low-level Zone 2 cardio three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=5170"&gt;Glymphatics and Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red light, perhaps, is going to be useful although sunlight might be
just as good depending on who you talk to, and we can talk about that
probably more at length in a future episode. A number of people will
ask me, I'm sure, about stem cells and I don't want to take more of
your time by going into an hour-long discussion about stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=5189"&gt;Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds and Should Nots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells exist in all of us during development. We were created from
stem cells, which are cells that can become essentially anything.
Later, cells get what's called restricted in their lineage, so a skin
cell, unless you do some fancy molecular gymnastics to it, you can't
actually turn that cell into a neuron. Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize
for finding these Yamanaka factors which you could give a skin cell to
turn into a neuron, but that's not an approved therapy at this time,
but many people ask me about platelet-rich plasma, so-called PRP. They
take blood, they enrich for platelets, and they re-inject it back into
people. Here's the deal. This deserves an entire episode. It has never
been shown whether or not the injection itself is what's actually
creating the effect. This is something that the acupuncture literature
suffered from for a long time, that the sham control, as it's called,
sham, we don't mean it's a sham, but in science you say a sham control
meaning you do everything exactly the same way you would. So for
acupuncture, you would bring the needle right up to the skin, but you
wouldn't actually poke it into the skin, for instance. That would be a
sham control. With a drug treatment, you would inject a drug into a
person and then the control, the sham control, would be that you would
bring the injection over, you might do the injection or not do the
injection 'cause you imagine that the injection itself could have an
effect. It's never really been shown whether or not PRP has effects
that are separate from injecting a volume of fluid into a tissue. The
claims that PRP actually contains stem cells are very, very feeble,
and when you look at the literature and you talk to anyone expert in
the stem cell field, they will tell you that it's, the number of stem
cells in PRP is infinitesimally small. In fact, so much so that these
places that inject PRP for injuries are not allowed to advertise
through the use of the words stem cells. It's actually illegal at this
point, at least as far as I know. It was through the end of last year
and I'm guessing it still is now. Stem cells are an exciting area of
technology. However, there's a clinic down in Florida that was shut
down a couple of years ago for injecting stem cells harvested from
patients into the eye for macular degeneration. These were people that
were suffering from poor vision and very shortly after injecting the
stem cells into the eyes, they went completely blind. I'm somebody who
is very skeptical of the stem cell treatment work that's out there.
It's actually very hard to get in the United States for this reason.
It's not approved. The PRP treatments are very complicated. The
marketing around them is shaky at best. I'm sure a number of people
will say that they had PRP and benefited from it tremendously and I
don't doubt that. Whether or not it was placebo, today we talked a lot
about top-down control, that's just a variant on the word placebo,
belief effects, whether or not it was placebo or not, I don't know. I
wasn't there. That's for you to decide and I'm not here to tell you
that you should or shouldn't do something, but I do think that
anything involving stem cells, one should be very cautious of. You
should also be very cautious of anyone that tells you that PRP is
injecting a lot of stem cells. This is an evolving area that really
needs a lot more work and attention. The major issue with stem cells
that I think is concerning is that stem cells are cells that want to
become lots of different things, not just the tissue that you're
interested in. If you damage your knee and you inject stem cells into
your knee, you need to molecularly restrict those stem cells so that
they don't become tumor cells. A tumor is a collection of stem cells.
When you get something horrible like glioblastoma in the brain, which
is a terrible thing to have, it's glial cells that returned to
stemness, excessive stemness, they've started to produce too many of
themselves, and glioblastoma is often deadly, not always. Injecting
stem cells, it sounds great, and it sounds like something that one
would want to do, but one needs to approach this with extreme caution,
even if it's your own blood or stem cells that you're re-injecting. I
think those technologies are coming. They're on the way. If any of you
are devotees of PRP, tell me your experiences with them. I'm curious.
I want to see the papers. I want to know the evidence, and of course,
there are always folks out there that say, "I don't care what the
scientists and the physicians and the FDA say. I just want to do
this," and if that's your stance, that's your stance. I'm not here to
govern that, but I do think that people should be informed, and in
thinking about tissue recovery and injury, that's what I was able to
glean. Again, check out what Kelly and his coworkers are doing at The
Ready State. It's phenomenal and they've worked with all the top
people in just about every domain of life, it seems. Very high-
integrity folks. Some of you are probably saying, "Well, I'm not
injured. I'm not an athlete. I don't want stem cell injections. I
don't have," again, I'm saying you shouldn't get stem cell injections
for now. Please hold off until the field learns more about how to do
that safely, but I want to talk about and end with a really
interesting and somewhat weird technology, which is baby blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=5498"&gt;Young Blood: Actual Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a colleague at Stanford, his name is Tony Wyss-Coray, and in
2014 his laboratory published a study showing that the blood of young
rodents, mice and rats, when transfused into old, demented rodents,
mice and rats, made those old, demented rodents recover much of their
memory and seem much more vital and energetic, better recall of
different spatial learning tasks. Tissue and wound healing, they've
since shown, can be improved in these older animals. It's pretty
incredible. They went on to show several years later that blood from
umbilical cords, I'm not making this up, blood from umbilical cords
can do the same and this is the basis of a biotech company. Actually,
one of my former postdocs is now an employee there. They've isolated
the molecules from young blood that seems to vitalize or revitalize
the old brain and body, and one of those molecules goes by the name
TIMP2. T-I-M-P-2. Where's all this going? Well, I don't know how long
it's going to be before there are treatments based on these blood
transfusions. I doubt that blood transfusions themselves from young
people into old people is going to be used for the treatment of
dementia, although it might, as weird as it seems. We know that
transfusions of all sorts of stuff, for instance, fecal transplants
are being used to treat obesity. The gut microbiome of thin people is
being, not transfused, but is being transplanted into the colons and
guts of obese people and leading to weight loss, which sounds really
wild and is not a topic I particularly enjoy talking about, but
nonetheless, it points to the importance of the gut microbiome in
regulating things like blood sugar and health as it relates to obesity
and diabetes and all sorts of things. It does appear that there are
things, factors in the blood of young members of a given species that
are lost over time in the older members of that species. I'm not going
to give you a tool on the basis of these findings today. I am not
going to tell you to consume any fluid from any other member of your
species, our species, for any reason, but I do think that it's
important to mention that the science is asking questions such as what
are the factors within the brain that allow the young brain to recover
so much better than the older brain from injury, from all sorts of
things, events, et cetera, and what are the factors in the older brain
that are limiting, and thinking about identifying which factors are
going to allow people to restore cognitive function, physical
function, wound healing and so forth. It's a really exciting area. I
mention it not to be sensationalist but because it's happening and
because there's a lot of excitement about it and because I think it's
clear that the young brain and body and blood are very different from
the old brain, body and blood, and the goal of science is to identify
and isolate those factors that make that so, such that people who
would otherwise get dementia or perhaps even have dementia will be
allowed to recover. Again, not an actionable item at this point, but
one to think about, perhaps not too long, but one to think about. I'm
going to close there. I've talked about a lot of tools today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPSRWUYCv0&amp;amp;t=5744"&gt;Synthesis, Support &amp;amp; Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've talked a lot about somatosensation, about plasticity, about pain,
about acupuncture, some of the nuance of acupuncture, inflammation and
stress. We even talked a little bit about high-intensity breathing,
talked about restricting limb movement to get compensatory regrowth of
pathways, or I should say reactivation of pathways that have been
injured or damaged. As always, we take a whirlwind tour through a
given topic, lay down some tools as we go. Hopefully the principles
that relate to pain and injury but also neuroplasticity in general,
today in the context of the somatosensory system, will be of use to
all of you. I don't wish injury on any of you, but I do hope that
you'll take this information to mind and that you will think about it
if ever you find yourself in a situation where you have to ask what's
the difference between my perception and the actual tissue damage? Is
injury and pain, is it the same? Well, no. Do I have some control over
my experience of pain? Absolutely. Does all of that involve taking
drugs or doing certain therapeutics? No, not necessarily. There's the
incredible subjective component. There also is a need sometimes to
treat the injury at the level of the pain receptors at the site of the
wound, so please take the information, do with it what you will, and
in the meantime, thank you so much for your time and attention. Before

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science, and
science-based tools for everyday life. My name is Andrew Huberman, and
I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology, at Stanford School
of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research
roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to
bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science
related tools. And keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
InsideTracker analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better
understand your body and health and health needs. I've been getting my
blood tested for many years now. Because, it just turns out that many
of the things that are important to our health and wellbeing can only
be detected in a blood test or a DNA test. InsideTracker makes that
really easy. They can come to your house to take those samples if you
like, or you can go to a nearby clinic as well. The major problem with
most blood tests and DNA tests is that it's very hard to make sense of
the information you get. You get a lot of numbers related to metabolic
factors, endocrine factors, et cetera. InsideTracker makes it very
easy, to decipher what those levels, in your blood and DNA mean, and
what to do about them. They have a very easy to use dashboard that if
you go to it, it can inform about lifestyle choices such as, adding or
subtracting certain forms of exercise or nutrition, other things
related to supplementation. It's a really powerful and easy to use
program. If you wanna try InsideTracker, you can go to
insidetracker.com/huberman, and put Huberman at checkout to get 25%
off any of their programs. That's insidetracker.com/huberman, and put
Huberman at checkout. The second sponsor of today's podcast is
Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one, vitamin mineral
probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012. And so
I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. I started using
Athletic Greens and I still use Athletic Greens, because I find it
very complicated and almost dizzying to figure out which vitamins and
minerals I need to take in order to just cover my nutritional basis.
Taking Athletic Greens makes that very easy. It also tastes very good.
I mix mine with water, a little bit of lemon juice, and I really like
it. So I drink it once or twice a day. The probiotics that are in
Athletic Greens are also important to me. Because there are a lot of
data now showing that the gut microbiome, which is supported by
probiotics, is important for things like the gut brain access, mood,
endocrine factors, metabolism, many, many biological functions. And so
by taking Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins, the minerals and the
probiotics all in one. Easy to consume, great tasting drink. If you
wanna try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
And if you do that you'll also get, a one year supply of liquid
vitamin D three K two. There are a lot of data now as well, showing
that vitamin D three is important for immune function, for mood,
endocrine factors, as well as other systems in the brain and body.
That's athleticgreens.com/huberman. And I should also mention if you
do that you won't just get the vitamin D three K two year supply,
you'll also get five free travel packs of Athletic Greens. Mixing up
powders when one is on the road, either in the car or in a hotel or on
the plane, et cetera, can be kinda messy. These little travel packs
make it really clean and easy. So once again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman, you'll get a special offer, of your
Athletic Greens but you'll also get the year supply of vitamin D3 K2,
and the five free travel packs. The third sponsor of today's podcast
is Madefor. Madefor is a behavioral science company that makes
attaining positive changes and growth mindset easy, through a simple
set of steps, and a monthly program. The company was founded by former
Navy SEAL Patrick Dossett and Toms founder, Blake Mycoskie. I'm the
head of their scientific advisory board. And the other members of the
advisory board, include people like the director of the chronobiology
unit the National Institute of Mental Health, members of Harvard
Medical School, and many other people who are serious about taking
science and developing protocols, that can be applied towards positive
habits, and growth mindset. If you wanna check out Madefor, you can go
to getmadefor.com. And if you purchase any of their products and put
Huberman at checkout, you'll get 20% off their program. In addition to
that, we do a monthly Zoom call, where the members of Madefor get on
it. And Patrick and myself, sometimes Blake as well, discuss the
Madefor program and the personal goals and things that people are
trying to achieve with the program. So it's a dialogue back and forth
on Zoom call once a month. Once again, that's getmadefor.com, put in
Huberman at checkout, and you'll be able to get the 20% off as well as
access to the monthly Zoom calls with us. Let's talk about
neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=293"&gt;The Daily (Learning) Routine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, let's talk about how, we can optimize our brains.
Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature of our nervous system that
allows it to change itself, even in ways that we consciously decide.
That's an incredible property. Our liver can't decide to just change
itself. Our spleen can't decide to just change itself, through
conscious thought, or through feedback from another person. The cells
in those tissues can make changes sure, but it's our nervous system,
that harbors this incredible ability to direct its own changes, in
ways that we believe, or we're told will serve us better. Now, today's
a really special episode because, while we are going to talk about
science and as always we will delve into mechanism. Today's episode is
really geared toward answering your most common questions about how to
leverage neuroplasticity. The previous episodes were about focus, and
how to achieve focus for sake of plasticity. As well as the last
episode which is, what are some of the portals into plasticity that
relate to movement, how behavior can activate plasticity, as well as
how to activate plasticity for behavior itself. How to get better at
learning certain movements. Today's podcast is really directed toward
answering your most common questions, and the bigger theme, of how
does one go about optimizing their brain or even think about,
optimizing the brain? What is this thing that we're calling optimizing
the brain? In doing so I'm also gonna share some of my, typical
routines and tools. I don't share these because I think that they are
the only ones that are available out there. Certainly they're not. Nor
do I share them because I think that everyone should do them just
'cause I do them, certainly not. I share them because many of you,
have asked for very concrete examples of what I do and when, and so
I'll share those with you and you can decide whether or not those
protocols are for you or not. Everybody's different, but there are
some common features, of how we are all put together, at the level of
the nervous system and body, that direct us toward particular
practices, particular routines that can be especially powerful, for
neuroplasticity. So I wanna open up the discussion today, by
emphasizing something, that's fundamentally important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=433"&gt;Plasticity Is NOT the Goal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is that plasticity, is not the goal. Plasticity is never the
goal. Plasticity is simply a state, or a capacity, for our nervous
system to change. And so, nothing makes me more frustrated, perhaps
then when I hear, oh, you know, this pill, this potion, this practice,
it gives you plasticity. Plasticity is just change. The real question
is what are you trying to change? And specifically what end goal are
you trying to achieve? Specific end goals might be extremely specific.
Like, you want to learn how to speak a particular language or you want
to learn a new motor skill or you want to get very good at calculus,
or you'd like to forget the bad emotions related to a particular human
being or experience, or it can be more general. Like you'd like to be
more creative. And we'll actually talk about creativity today. Or you
would like to achieve more focus or you'd like to be less stressed. So
it's very important, that you understand that plasticity, and
achieving plasticity is the first step, in what we call optimizing
your brain. You don't want your brain to be plastic all the time. In
fact, one of the major questions, one of the major unsolved mysteries
of neuroscience is how each and every one of us wakes up every day,
and knows who we are. Why should that be? Well, the brain is plastic.
It has a capacity to change throughout the lifespan but it's not so
plastic, that every night when we go to sleep, or in our waking that
the connections get reconfigured so much so that we forget who we are,
or how to walk, or how to eat. It's a good thing that we don't have,
such robust plasticity or ongoing plasticity, that we have to
restructure ourselves each day. It's part of what gives our life
continuity. So remember, plasticity is not and is never the goal. The
goal is to figure out how to access plasticity, and then to direct
that plasticity, toward particular goals or changes that you would
like to achieve. And I should just mention, there's no rule that in
life you have to leverage this incredible thing called neuro-
plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=566"&gt;No Obligation To Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one said you had to do that. This podcast in this episode is
particularly for people, who are either happy or unhappy with where
they're at with a particular aspect of their life. And they wanna
shift it, in some positive way. And many of you listening might say,
well wouldn't everyone wanna do that? Well actually, there are a
certain number of people that are pretty good where they're at and
they don't wanna change and that's terrific. And I tip my hat to them
and I think that's wonderful. If ever they decide that they wanna
leverage these plasticity mechanisms, they can, at any stage
throughout the lifespan. Let's start by talking about the different
systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=599"&gt;Practical Plasticity Language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;within the nervous system, that are available for plasticity. And in
doing so, I'll frame them in the context of what I do on a daily
basis, on a weekly basis, and on a yearly basis. First of all, there
are several forms of plasticity. They have names like long-term
potentiation, long-term depression, which has nothing to do with
emotional depression, by the way. And things like spike-timing-
dependent plasticity. Those names are used to describe cellular
phenomenon. The actual ways that the synapses, the connections between
neurons change. I'll mention those things and I'll give a little more
[indistinct] to what they are as I mentioned them. But, that's
probably not the best way to think about plasticity in terms of
optimizing your brain. The best way to think about it is in terms of
short term, medium term, and long-term plasticity. Short-term
plasticity, is any kind of shift that you want to achieve, in the
moment or in the day, but that you don't necessarily wanna hold on to
forever. You might say, well, what kinds of things are those? Well,
for instance, short-term plasticity might be, you wake up earlier than
you would like to catch a flight. You're not feeling particularly
alert, and you want to use a protocol, or you decide to use a protocol
which could be coffee or it could be a certain form of breathing or it
could be some other tool, to become more alert at a time of day when
normally you aren't that alert. But, your expectation is that when you
return home, you will discard with that, the need to do that at 5:30
AM because you'll be asleep at 5:30 AM. So there's short-term
plasticity, behavioral plasticity. Then there's medium-term plasticity
which are changes, that you might wanna make. I call this with
respect, and a little bit of humor, or at least my kinda humor. I call
this the undergraduate, pre-med phenomenon. For those of you that have
worked with pre-meds. And I have tremendous respect for medical
students and pre-meds, there is a kind of a stereotype which I don't
necessarily agree with, but the stereotype is that they wanna know
what they need to know for sake of the exam, but they don't really
wanna know. They just want the A. And I don't think that's always
true. I've worked with a number of different pre-meds over the years
and there are many of them that are absolutely, passionate about the
knowledge itself. And they also wanted the A. But the pre-med
phenomenon as it's discussed among professors and TAs, is that, you
know, you've got these students, they just wanna know what they need
to know so they can get the A, right? It's medium-term plasticity.
They don't actually want it to be embedded in their memory too long,
or else they would actually care about the information. So that's
medium term information. And sometimes that's useful for instance if
you go on vacation to Costa Rica, and you don't know your way around
Costa Rica. You wanna learn the different town and the routes there.
But you don't have any intention of going back. It's just medium term.
You wanna just program it in for sake of your time there and then you
wanna discard it. Most of the time when we think about or talk about
optimizing the brain, we're talking about long-term plasticity. We're
talking about the kinds of changes that people wanna make so that
their brain reflexively works differently. This is what a child does
when it goes from not knowing how to walk to knowing how to walk. It
doesn't have to think about it after it learns how to walk. It becomes
reflexive. Long-term plasticity, is almost always the big goal. It's I
wanna know how to speak that language. I wanna be able to do that
skill. I wanna be able to feel this way, without having to put much
work into it. And there are tools and protocols that one can do to
achieve that. And we are going to talk about those. We've talked about
a few of them in previous episodes but I will revisit those protocols
today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=817"&gt;Pillars of Neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm gonna frame all this in the context of the daily life, the weekly
life, and the yearly life. And that's because, neuroplasticity and
optimizing your brain, rides on a deeper foundation, of this thing
that governs plasticity. In fact, governs all our life, called
autonomic arousal which is that we're asleep for part of the 24 hour
cycle and we are awake almost always. If we push ourselves and stay
awake, we're okay. We can do that for a night or two, but almost
always we are asleep for a portion of it and we are awake for a
portion of it. I've said it before but I'll say it again. The trigger
for plasticity in learning occurs during high focus, high alertness
states, not while you're asleep. And the focus and alertness are both
key because of the neurochemicals associated with those states. But,
the actual rewiring and the reconfiguration of the brain connections
happens during non sleep deep rest, which we'll talk more about as
always. And, deep sleep. So you trigger the change and in sleep you
get the change. So, some of the things that we'll talk about today
about optimizing the brain, are centered around not sleep, but around
the autonomic arousal system. We have this system of neurons in our
brain and body that's just incredible, that wake us up and make us
alert. And when we're not accessing that system, well, we cannot
access plasticity. We can not optimize our brain. Likewise, if we
cannot sleep well, and we can't rest well, we will not access
plasticity and rewire our brain because that's when the actual
configuration between the connections occurs. So to set this in
context,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=916"&gt;My Daily Routine: Chronotype Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up each day, and I'll be totally honest. I usually don't feel
like bouncing right out of bed. I usually don't feel completely
rested. And that's not because I don't get enough sleep. It's probably
because I'm not terrific about timing my sleep so well. Now this month
isn't about sleep, that was the previous month but I really wanna
emphasize a few points. I wake up, generally more tired, and groggy
than I would like, because I tend to go to sleep too late. It's just
some thing that I do. And I tend to get up early either because I set
an alarm, because I have things to do, or because I naturally wake up
early because the light coming in and so forth. Well, what that tells
me is that I'm probably somebody whose natural circadian rhythm. You
may have heard of chronotypes. These are genetically programmed
things. But chronotype, is shorter than 24 hours. It means that the
cycle of waking and alertness for me is probably shorter than 24
hours. Which means that getting some light in the late afternoon will
help me shift, and make my cycle a little bit longer. It will phase
delay me if that doesn't make any sense, see a previous episode. But
what it really means is getting some light in the afternoon, will
allow me to stay up a little bit later. But what it means is that, I'm
not really matching my hard-wired needs of going to bed probably at
8:30 or 9:00 and waking up at 4:00 AM. I tend to go to sleep around
10:30, 11:00, lately around 11:30 or 12:00 and then I wake up at 6:00.
And so of course, I'm gonna feel groggy. So neuroplasticity will allow
me, to optimize my wakefulness but I have to do something in order to
access that. And some of you may already be anticipating what I'm
about to say, which is, oh, no he's gonna tell us to get sunlight in
our eyes in the first 30 minutes of the day. I am gonna tell you to do
that, but I'm gonna also tell you two things that I've have not
discussed before, which relate to the plasticity, between the
melanopsin cells. These sunlight detecting, bright light detecting
cells in our eye and the circadian clock. I've never said this before
in this podcast, but it turns out that the connections&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1040"&gt;Plasticity of the Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;between these melanopsin cells and the circadian clock, are plastic
throughout the lifespan. There's a massive configuration of the
connections there. And a cell type called the astrocytes which are a
glial cell, are actively removing and reinforcing connections between
the eye and that clock, every day. Now this is incredible because
other aspects of your brain that for instance, represent you knowing
who you are, when you wake up in the morning, or what your name is,
assuming that you're old enough that you've already learned your name.
When the first things kids learn and something we rarely ever forget.
Those connections, are changing all the time every 24 hour cycle. So
there's an opportunity for short-term plasticity. So that's why I view
sunlight first thing in the day, it helps me wake up. The other thing
that I do is that there's a circuit, that exists between the circadian
clock and our adrenals that I've talked about before that triggers the
release of cortisol first thing in the morning, that wakes us up.
Especially when we view light. So if you're groggy in the morning
that's why viewing light is helpful. But, the interesting thing is if
you start viewing light frequently in the morning, then those
connections between the melanopsin cells and the circadian clock,
become primed or potentiated we would say, they become stronger for
the anticipation of light. And you naturally start waking up earlier,
feeling more alert. So, what this says is and what I do is I get that
regular light because I know that some mornings, I'm just not gonna
feel very alert, I'll feel, especially tired. And I might not be able
to access sunlight because it's really overcast or I'm traveling, or
some other feature. But the system is plastic so it shifted in the
right direction. Now it will shift back, because it's short-term
plasticity after about two, three days. So you wanna try and get the
sunlight exposure on a regular basis. The other thing that I do is I
delay my intake of caffeine, for the first two hours that I'm awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1149"&gt;Delay Caffeine!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this can be very painful for people. But, earlier we talked
about, the adenosine system and how the accumulation of adenosine
makes us sleepy. And caffeine suppresses adenosine and it makes us
feel alert. But we know, that if you ingest caffeine, immediately on
waking, the signal to the adrenals, to release cortisol, which is a
healthy release of cortisol, and the suppression of adenosine that
happens as we come out of sleep, and in deep sleep the suppression of
adenosine, if you ingest caffeine too early, there's a mechanism by
which the adenosine competes for the receptors et cetera, so that you
have a mid-morning crash. Because if caffeine, the way it works is if
caffeine is occupying the adenosine receptor, then the natural
endogenous mechanisms, for suppressing adenosine, are not actually
gonna have their action. So the brain to adrenal axis, is subject to
plasticity also. And so by delaying caffeine until about two hours
after waking, I'm able to capture, and reinforce, to potentiate, the
neural circuit that exists between the circadian clock and the
cortisol released in the adrenals, as well as, leave those adenosine
receptors, unoccupied so that I can then use the caffeine to get a
natural lift, in alertness and focus two hours later as opposed to
using it, just to wake myself up out of sleepiness. So while I'm sure
there are some eye-rolls out there and some yawns, about, oh no, it's
the sunlight in the morning thing again. It's a powerful tool, for
readjusting these circuits. So the short-term plasticity. And the
reason for delaying caffeine for the first two hours of the day even
if it's painful to do for the first couple of days is that then you
naturally start to wake up, more readily in the morning without
caffeine because, the adenosine is suppressed and you don't have these
competing. It's called a competing antagonist, for the adenosine
receptor. So I wake up, I get sunlight in my eyes. Lately because I
wake up very early I do use a bright light, to stimulate alertness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1279"&gt;Light, Black Coffee, Hydrate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not actually designed for that purpose. It's just a light board
that has been about 900 lux. And then I delay caffeine. Some of you
have asked, and again I'm not saying anyone has to do this. You know,
what exactly do you drink? I'm a big believer in black coffee. I just
happen to like black coffee. People have asked me about, and I don't
wanna name brand names here about this type of coffee or, that type of
coffee you mixed with these other, kinds of things. Will that increase
focus? You know, I'm gonna talk today a lot about the use of diet and
fasting and timing of foods and certain kinds of foods. But to be
honest, black coffee is just a simple choice that's always worked for
me. I also make sure I hydrate first thing in the morning. There is
plenty of data now showing that even a slight, increase in
dehydration, meaning just when you're lacking water, can make people
have headaches. It can provide some additional photophobia for those
of you that are migraine prone. Bright light can trigger migraines.
That's no surprise to those of you that get headaches and migraines.
But dehydration, can compound, the vulnerability to migraine and
headache. So I drink water, I drink black coffee, or I drink mate
which is just because I have Argentine lineage which is just a high
caffeine drink first thing in the morning, but I delay it until two
hours after I wake up. And that's because, I want the circuits between
my eye and my circadian clock and my adrenals, to be functioning in a
particular way, so that then later the caffeine is an addition. It
adds more alertness. Now this is a discussion about how to optimize
your brain. Many people who wake up quickly, and just naturally feel
like bouncing out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1377"&gt;High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I envy these people. They will do just fine, by going into a learning
bout or taking care of, whatever it is that they need to take care of.
Sometimes that's kind of more mundane tasks like email and whatnot.
Here's a more or less a rule about how the brain functions, vis-a-vis,
focus, learning and creativity. And I'm gonna discuss this much more
in future episodes. Generally states of high alertness, when we're
very very alert, are great for strategy implementation. When we
already know how to do something. And it's just simply a matter of
plugging the correct elements into the correct boxes. I've talked
before about duration, path and outcome, as the three things that the
deliberate conscious brain is trying to figure out in order to perform
certain tasks, even cognitive tasks. This is the sort of thing that we
are very good at when we're well rested, and we're focused. In our
autonomic arousal or our alertness rather is at a high level. If you
are somebody who is hitting that alertness phase of your day, very
early, right after you wake up, that's a great time to move right into
things that, at least the research says, you already know, have the
strategy and you just wanna implement the strategy. This is where I
fundamentally depart from the idea that, oh, you know, you have to do
the hardest or most critical tasks throughout the day. Sometimes the
hardest and most critical tasks, are tasks that require creativity.
And as we'll soon talk about creativity, and tasks related to it,
oftentimes come to us best or the brain is best at achieving those,
when we're in states of calm or even slightly drowsy. Which is
something that's interesting in what we'll get into. But for me, for
instance, I get up, I'm not terribly alert, first thing. And so I try
and just get my brain and my thoughts organized. It's not a time for
me to be responding in a very linear fashion to emails or carrying out
calculations. That comes about two hours later. And I think many
people out there will relate, mid-morning is when many people tend to
achieve their peak in alertness and focus. Now, many times I get the
question and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1512"&gt;Background Music/Noise: Yay or Nay?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this what I'm about to say is directly related to the hundreds of
questions I got about this. Should I use, background music in order to
learn? Should I have, you know, construction next door? Is that a good
thing or a bad thing? Is it better to be in complete silence, et
cetera? Now this will vary. Some people can tolerate their own noise
within their head much better than others. Other people find that
having some background noise, helps cancel that out. But there's a
simple rule of thumb that one can use, because at least my experience
is that sometimes background music, background noise is very helpful
for allowing me to focus. And other times, it's very distracting. So
what actually governs that? Well, we have to ask ourselves, what is at
the source, of the lack of focus? If our lack of focus is because our
autonomic arousal or our alertness is very, very high. We had a little
too much coffee, or if there is such a thing, slept a little too long
or we're really stressed or really activated, and we can't seem to
focus. In that case, eliminating background noise, and really just
trying to get silence, so that we can quiet some of that autonomic
arousal, is going to be best for learning and for implementation of
things we already know how to do. For any kind of focus linear task.
Which, basically learning is a focus linear task is that you're just
not necessarily, performing well all the time. Last time we talked
about making errors. So as a rule of thumb, if you're too keyed up,
then silence and quiet is going to be helpful. In fact, if you're very
keyed up, a particular circuit, related to the basal ganglia, starts
getting triggered more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1612"&gt;“GO” versus “NO-GO”: The Basal Ganglia &amp;amp; Dopamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this circuit, I'm gonna talk about in depth. But, it's called the
go, no-go circuit. We have circuits that connect our forebrain, to our
structure in our brain called the basal ganglia which is actually a
collection of structures. And the forebrain, which is involved in
rational thought and thinking and planning and action, is always
trying to plan what should I do, and then implement that action. And
the basal ganglia are intimately involved in that discussion. There's
a reciprocal loop of communication, between basil ganglia and cortex.
The basal ganglia has one set of connections to the cortex, and the
cortex back to the basal ganglia that facilitates go. It facilitates
action. And the molecule, the neuromodulator dopamine, triggers the
activation of go. It tends to make us want to do more things. It tends
to make us bias toward action. By the way that dopamine binds to
something called the D1 receptors. Just a particular type of dopamine
receptor. For those of you that wanna know. The no-go pathway, the
pathway in the basal ganglia, and cortex that suppresses action,
involves dopamine binding to this other receptor called the D2
receptor. Now D1, D2 receptors, you can't just consciously decide, oh,
I only want my D1 receptors and my D2 receptors to be active. You have
to think about, which sorts of states of mind and body, facilitate go,
and which ones facilitate no-go. Now this is critically important,
because doing focused work, accessing plasticity, and learning,
involve doing certain things and not doing others. So here's how it
works. And here's how I apply it on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1717"&gt;Leveraging GO, NO-GO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I tend to be most alert, first thing, mid-morning or so. And
then I generally will have my caffeine mid-morning. My peak of
alertness, in the early part of the day, is occurring for me sometime
between 9:30 and 11:00 AM. That's just me. Other people might
experience that immediately after rolling out of bed. They might be
wide awake and ready to go. Which case they should be cautious about
throwing caffeine in the mix and it's gonna make them very, very
alert. There are three sort of levels, of autonomic arousal of
alertness, that bias us more toward go, no-go, or both. And this
relates, to a question that I've gotten now hundreds of times from
you, in the comment section for this podcast, which is, is it better
for me to listen to music in the background while I work and learn, or
should I have complete silence? And the answer is it depends. But it
doesn't depend randomly on who you are, or even necessarily time of
day, it depends, on your overall level of autonomic arousal. And it
depends because, autonomic arousal level of alertness, biases the
extent to which, we are more prone to gos to action, or to no-gos, to
suppress action. And dopamine is this molecule that's swimming around
and is going to buy us one or the other responses. So here's how it
works. Let's say, I'm very alert. Maybe I got a particularly good
night's sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1808"&gt;Non-Specific Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the night before, I had a little too much coffee, and I'm gonna sit
down to some work. The thing to know, and what I always tell myself is
when I'm very alert, I am very prone to go, to action, but I'm also
prone to, not no-go, right? I'm not gonna be very good at suppressing
action. So those are two different things. Being biased toward action
and being biased, toward suppressing action are two different things,
okay? So those are push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, when
you're very alert, the tendency is for everything to be a stimulus.
This is why when people say, well, should I just take a drug that will
increase my level of epinephrine and alertness? Will that help me
learn better? No, because it will make you do things, but it will also
make you less good at suppressing actions that you need to suppress.
So if I'm very alert, particularly alert for me and I recognize what
that state is, of course 'cause everyone will be different. I know
what it is for me. Then I want silence for learning. I want it shut
down my internet, which I do. I sometimes use a program, that I
believe is a free program called Freedom, where it actually locks you
out of the internet for a particular time. They're not a sponsor of
the podcast. I just happen to use it. There's another version of
Freedom where you go to the wireless thing and you turn it off. You
disconnect from the wireless. That's the other one. Although, many
people have a hard time not reactivating it. So I'm trying to shut
down the go pathway towards distraction. And the other thing that I'll
do, is I'll generally turn off my phone, put the phone outside in the
car or in really extreme cases I'll throw it up on the roof which is
hard for me to retrieve, so that I can't get to it. So if I'm very
alert, I'm aware that I will have a bias toward action. It will be
hard for me to suppress non-action, but that it's very nonspecific.
Because, the next kind of level down of alertness,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=1926"&gt;Clear, Calm, Focused: The GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or autonomic arousal is clear, calm and focused where we have that
kind of sweet spot between, our willingness to pursue action. We're in
a mode of go, and it's not always physical action but it can be
pursuing hard bouts of learning. But that our ability to suppress is
also very good. And this is because, and I don't wanna get into too
many details, because of the way that dopamine competes for these
dopamine one receptors in the go pathway and dopamine two receptors in
the no-go pathway. They're always in this kind of push pull. And so
there is a sweet spot. And that sweet spot isn't flow, where it is in
some sort of state where all of a sudden things come naturally to us.
The state that we're trying to achieve that's optimal for learning is
one in which, we have the energy and focus to pursue, but we also have
the energy and focus to suppress action. So the basal ganglia are
kinda working in a perfect kind of sing songly manner, through this
parallel pathway. Now, as we get tired or as we round out an ultradian
cycle of about 90 minutes, what happens is our fatigue even if it's
not a physical fatigue that makes us wanna go to sleep, but our mental
fatigue starts to accumulate because these pathways of go, no-go are
actually, very metabolically consuming. So what I recognize is that as
they start to falter, I have a harder time engaging and going or going
toward the goal rather. I also know that my reflex, toward actions
that are unrelated to the learning are also gonna start increasing
because I'm not gonna be able to suppress action and activate the no-
go pathways. So if this all sounds like a mouthful, let's make it very
simple for you. When you are very alert,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2028"&gt;When Very Alert, Work In Silence; When Tired, Include Background Noise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the best situation for learning is going to be silence. It's going to
be complete quiet. If you are low arousal, and you're tired and you're
kind of sleepy, a lot of people find that having some background
chatter and some background noise, can help elevate their level of
autonomic arousal. And that's because our auditory system and our
visual system, are linked and are part of really what's called the
salience network. Which is that we're always, scanning our environment
for things. And when we have a lot of things in our environment to
scan, generally our level of alertness goes up. This is why
environments that are very stark or have very little or very few
objects in them, tend to make us feel kind of calm, because our
salient network kinda shuts off. A lot of people don't like that.
They'll go to a meditation retreat, or they'll go into an environment
where there's very little clutter especially city people. And all of a
sudden, they start feeling really, really anxious. And that's because
their internal level of autonomic arousal is really high and it's not
being occupied by all this stuff to pay attention to. And so their
salience network starts to turn inward. They move from exteroception
to interoception. They're not looking outside themselves, they're
looking inside themselves and there's a lot of noise in there. So, as
a rule of thumb, if you tend to be kind of on the high level of
alertness and kind of anxiety, and I'm not talking about clinical
levels of anxiety but you tend to, be pretty high energy, well then,
you are definitely going to benefit more in a learning bout, from
learning to go as well as activate the no-go pathway. And that
requires a lot of energy. And when you have a lot of distractions in
your environment, there's a high probability that you're gonna be
distracted from the learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2128"&gt;Temperaments Vary: And So Should This&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some people are just naturally more calm. They're like my bulldog
Costello, who's exceedingly calm. They're pretty mellow. They're kind
of clear, calm and focused all of the time. And those people, actually
are gonna be less flappable. They're not gonna be yanked around by
background noise or they're not gonna be around, you know, bothered
from their learning or from their studying by a clanging of a pot from
somebody in the kitchen. So, each one of us generally tends to ride up
and down this autonomic ladder, so to speak, at different times a day.
For most people, three hours after waking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2161"&gt;The 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those three hours, not three hours on the mark but for that three hour
bin tends to be the period in which they're most alert throughout the
day. Except I'll tell you later about a unique time right before sleep
in which you're also very, very alert, naturally. So, that morning
three hours is quite vital. Now, many of you might ask about exercise
and when to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2180"&gt;Early Morning Exercise and GO Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I may have mentioned this on a previous podcast episode. But,
the research shows that at least for performance, afternoon exercise
might be better in terms of avoiding injury, et cetera. But in terms
of rising body temperatures, and matching body temperature to have
mental alertness, et cetera. It's pretty clear, that exercising early
in the day, not only biases us towards waking up earlier, but that it
also triggers the release of things like epinephrine and other
neuromodulators, that lend itself, to a situation where we have
heightened levels of arousal and mental acuity in the late morning and
even into the afternoon. Now, this can be very good because if you
wanna restrict most of your focus learning to the early part of the
day, exercising early in the day does set a neurochemical context or
mill you for go. It tends to trigger activation of the go pathway. And
so for those of you like myself who have a hard time kind of engaging
and getting into action early in the day, early morning exercise
within an hour of waking, and certainly no later than three hours
after waking, will give you quote unquote more energy throughout the
day. It will make you feel more biased for action. You won't feel as
lethargic. So, in can kind of reviewing what I've set up until now I
do the morning light thing, I delay my caffeine two hours after
waking, and then I generally try and get exercise in the first hour or
ideally within the first three hours of waking up. And then I'll move
into a focused learning bout. Now, some of you wrote to me and said,
if I exercise early in the day, then I feel a crash afterwards. If
that exercise is very, very intense. So you're depleting all your
glycogen. So you're doing heavy deadlifts, et cetera. Chances are
after you eat, you will start to feel a crash. So this relates to
timing of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2285"&gt;Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, &amp;amp; Food Volume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in just as a general rule of thumb, fasted states, and low
carbohydrate states, I'm not talking about a keto diet around the
clock or all week but fasted states, and low carbohydrate states lend
themselves to alertness. And that's because carbohydrates are rich in
tryptophan, and they tend to lend themselves to sleepiness. Of course,
ingesting large amounts of any kind of food, any substance that fills
your gut will divert blood to your gut. So if you eat a lot of food
regardless of whether or not it's a lot of carbohydrate or not, you're
going to generally feel more sleepy. Now, many people, including
everyone use food, to modulate their levels of autonomic arousal. And
typically eating shifts us more towards a state of calm. And fasting
shifts us more toward a state of alertness. And these are hard-wired
circuits that relate to the need and desire to find food which
requires action, or the so-called rest and digest system which diverts
our resources and our energy towards digestion. It makes us feel calm.
So I personally rely on water, mate, and black coffee first thing in
the day, in order to exercise and get into the first round of work. If
I find that I'm too alert, and then I generally will tend to eat and
kind of bring down my level of alertness, and will continue working.
Now this is in district thing. And since people asked me what I do,
and I'm not dictating that people follow it exactly of course or even
generally, but I'll just tell you what I do. It is possible if you're
drinking black coffee, or mate and you're ingesting a lot of water,
that you're going to dehydrate yourself somewhat, because of excretion
of sodium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2381"&gt;Sodium/Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided you don't have hypertension, salt is a really good thing. A
lot of people think that they are low on blood sugar because they're
shaky and they can't think or they have a headache when actually
they're low in sodium. And especially if you're drinking a lot of
caffeine. So I'm a big believer in salt. So I drink salt water first
thing in the morning because I drink black coffee. And that keeps my
levels of alertness really good. I always thought that I had messed up
blood sugar. I had shaky hands and I didn't know what was going on.
I'd drink a little bit of coffee and feel too amped up. And turns out
that it was a sodium issue. And if I just drank water with a little
bit of sea salt and or even just a typical table salt, then I'd fell
rock solid in terms of my blood sugar. Now, again, I'm not a
physician, I'm a professor so I don't prescribe anything, but I
profess lots of things. So I don't want people who have diabetes or
blood sugar issues to go off the rails. You're responsible for your
health, not me. But it's an interesting parameter to think about and
experiment with, you know, provided that your doctor says it's okay,
because I think a lot of people, probably ingest too much sodium but a
lot of people might be sodium deficient in particular the people that
are fasting. I typically eat my first meal right around mid day,
whether or not I've exercised or not. And the food content there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2457"&gt;Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is actually quite important to me. I don't know why this is. I don't
have a scientific mechanism for this but if I eat hot food for lunch,
I get sleepy after lunch. So I generally don't eat hot food for lunch.
I might have a little bit of soup or something like that. But in
general, I rely on a low carbohydrate meal. I'll eat meat or salad or
some variation of that and nuts and fats and things like that because
of the [indistinct] content for focus, because the protein is good in
my belief. And because I believe in eating fruits and vegetables. I do
that too. If I've exercised very hard early in the day, I do ingest
starches like oatmeal or rice and fruit and things like that. Now, why
am I telling you all this? Because, 100s if not 1000 people ask me, is
fasting good for focus? And indeed fasting will increase alertness,
but if you're so hungry or preoccupied with food that you can't focus
well, then it's not gonna be good for learning. It's only going to be
good for agitation. Now, I'm just gonna mark continue to march through
my day. And this is, of course what I experienced. Some people are
quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2521"&gt;Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what I find is around 2:00 or 3:00 PM, I start getting a little
groggy. A little bit sleepy. I will tend to shift my work from work
that requires a lot of duration path, outcome, really careful analysis
and activation of the no-go pathway. Meaning I'm trying to suppress
the impulse to look at my phone or answer email, or do other things.
This is why I haven't emailed you back until 3:00 in the afternoon. By
the way, or responded to your text messages, whoever you are out
there. Around early afternoon, I find I can do kind of typical more
mundane tasks. Because, those tasks require less cognitive load. And
they can be done more or less, in and out of sequence. I can answer a
couple email here, maybe answer that email there. I don't have to do
it in pure linear fashion. Any kind of linear work or learning work is
gonna take a lot of focus. And then typically around 4:00 PM or so, I
do two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2576"&gt;Hydration, NSDR, Nap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a little earlier. Sometimes a little later but I do two
things. One, is I make sure I hydrate. Because if you're exercising
and you're eating, you need to digest that food, et cetera. I make
sure I hydrate. So I drink water. I try and refrain from drinking
coffee in the afternoon. This is a new thing for me. I sometimes do
it, but I try and refrain from that. And then I always do, a non sleep
deep rest protocol sometime in the afternoon. This is sometimes a 10
minute yoga nidra type protocol, or a 30 minute yoga nidra type
protocol. These are protocols I have no relationship to, no business
relationship to whatsoever. I've been doing them for years now. They
involve listening to a script. We'll provide the links again although
we've provided them before. Or I'll do a hypnosis protocol, from
Reveri Health which is my colleague David Spiegel's website that has
these free hypnosis apps or scripts that you can listen to. And those
take me into a state of really deep rest. Sometimes so much so that I
fall asleep. And I always set an alarm so that I don't sleep for
longer than 90 minutes. But typically this goes for about 30 minutes.
And I do that because for me by about 4:30 in the afternoon, I'm
capable of doing basically nothing. I am just a complete Costello. I
can't think, I can't do, I can't respond to email. I've just
completely troughed my ability to function. I personally find it a
mistake, to that point, down a double espresso, and charge really
hard. It just doesn't work for me. I end up really disrupting my sleep
schedule. I end up disrupting a lot of different things. So for me, I
do the non sleep deep rest protocol. It really helps me later when I
need to fall asleep. It helps with all sorts of things, as I mentioned
before. But I usually emerge from that a little groggy or feeling like
I have another whole day, second wind. Like I could just work. And
then I'll do a second bout of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2694"&gt;Creativity Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll do some sort of work that either involves linear analysis of
something. So maybe numerical work or I'm trying to learn something. I
generally try and really use those bouts of 90 minute focus energy
after the non sleep deep rest. And as I mentioned in previous
episodes, there's a lot of evidence, that these non sleep deep rest
protocols can enhance and accelerate plasticity. The most I think
recent and striking one is the study that we referenced last time in
the caption notes. It was the cell press article, Cell Reports, great
journal. Was showing that these 20 minute, kinda shallow naps and non
sleep deep rests, can facilitate sensory motor learning. So then I'll
go into another learning bout that's caffeine free. This learning bout
is very different than the morning one. This is a work bout or
learning bout that's more in the clear common focus regime because
I've come out of this non sleep deep rest. I'm not ingesting caffeine
because I wanna make sure that I can sleep later that night really
well. And, this tends to be more when I do creative type work. Now,
creativity is a topic that we're gonna spend the entire month on
coming up soon. But creativity is a very interesting state of mind in
which, we're taking existing elements. Things that we already know,
and rearranging them in ways that are novel. And I'd say, well, duh,
that's what creativity is. But creativity has two parts. It has a
creative discovery mode where you're kind of shuffling things around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=2786"&gt;Creativity Is A Two-Part Phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a very relaxed way and kind of being playful or exploring different
configurations. And then creativity also has, an absolutely linear
implementation mode. In which you take the idea or the design you've
come up with and you create something very robust and concrete. And so
creativity is really a two part thing. And the first part of actively
exploring different configuration, sometimes in a playful way,
sometimes in a way that's almost random and just kind of exploring.
That state is definitely facilitated by being relaxed and almost
sleepy. That is not a state that I personally can access very well
early in the day. I've tried to access it coming out of sleep because
one would say, well you're still sleepy early in the day and just
doesn't work. Most of what I write down. Most of what I do is complete
garbage. And so what I found is there's this block in the afternoon of
about 90 minutes where, I can do creative type writing or creative
type imagination of, scientific ideas or experiments we might wanna
do. Science might not seem like a creative endeavor to many of you,
but it is. Has a lot of imagining what if this, or we could combine
that and thinking of novel concepts or ways of arranging things. So
when you find yourself in that kinda clear common focused mode,
creative works tend to come about very well in those regimes. Now I
know there are a lot of people out there rely on substances to access
creative states. I'm not a marijuana user. It's just not the drug for
me, for a variety of reasons. I'm not a drinker. It's not the
substance for me for a variety of reasons. You know, I'm not a cop I'm
not out here to tell people what they should do or shouldn't do. The
problem with using substances to access creativity, is that generally
the substances that relax people, will allow them to get into that
creative brainstorming mode, but not so good at the linear
implementation mode. You know, the other day I was remarking with a
friend that there are some ads, some advertisements that I've seen
over the years, that are just incredible. I'll just tell you what they
are. So there's not cryptic or anything. I'm revealing my tastes here.
There's a particular perfume ad that Spike Jones made that is just
amazing. I'll put a link to it cause it's just so cool. I don't want
to give away the end but it has a feature of it that is particularly
interesting to me as a neuroscientist. And it's just so cool. 'Cause I
grew up in the skateboarding thing, I knew a little bit about Spike's
movies and skateboarding and he's of course made a lot of very
impressive, popular movies as well, full length features. I don't know
him personally, so this isn't a plug. Not that he needs my endorsement
for anything at all. But the amazing thing about this advertisement is
it's a collection of things that you would never really think would be
combined, and it involves different speeds of motion and all sorts of
effects. I mean, it's like a real classic like Spike Jones kind
delivery. But, what's incredible is when you think about not just the
fact that someone had to imagine that but to actually implement the
steps in order to create that, when you see this you'll realize that
was a ton of work. You can't just put that together randomly. And so a
lot of people, not Spike clearly, but a lot of people who have an
incredible mind for ideas and novel arrangements of things, they are
great at accessing that state but not so good at accessing the
implementation state. It's also true that a lot of people and some who
tend to fall on what we would call the kind of like more Asperger's or
autism end of the spectrum, are very good at linear implementation.
Now I'm not talking about all forms of autism of course. I'm sensitive
to the fact that there are many forms on the spectrum. But, some
people are very good at linear implementation. And that's, a separate
state from a creative state. So, that afternoon block is when I try
and access the freer kind of looser mindset that's associated with the
fatigue that comes later in the afternoon. And, for some of you that
state that favors creativity and creative learning, might be better in
the morning. I don't know. You're gonna have to decide. For some of
you you're gonna be late shifted. Some of you are gonna be morning
shifted. But where we have alertness, generally we are good at linear
implementation, we're good at activating the no-go pathway and
suppressing action, and we are good at pursuing particular goals and
strategy implementation. And where we tend to be more relaxed, and we
tend to be almost in a kind of sleepy mode. So for me, coming out of
one of these non sleep, deep rest modes or sleep, that's when we tend
to be better at novel configurations of existing elements, which is
creativity. And this brings about a question that I get, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=3075"&gt;Psychedelics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is, what about psychedelics? So, I am going to talk, to some
experts on psychedelics. I hope to bring some of them in. Actually
speaking on people coming in or creatures coming. A creature that's
definitely not on psychedelics who doesn't need any is Costello and he
just arrived. He seems to be in a sleepy state most, all the time. Hey
buddy, how you doing? You come in, yep. He's working on his 15th sleep
deep rest episode of the day which is generally followed by a 10 to 12
hour deep rest episode, almost exclusively comprised of REM. And I
know this 'cause his eyes are open 'cause they're so droopy, he can't
close them all the way and his eyes are going like this. And he's
going down for the count. So, yeah, nice and big yawn. Okay so,
psychedelics. First of all, I wanna be very clear. I am neither a
proponent, nor am I somebody who rejects the potential role of
psychedelics. I do however, think that psychedelics, can be
particularly hazardous, for people who have preexisting psychological
issues, and are not working with a board certified, psychiatrist or
physician, as well as for essentially all kids. I think that the young
brain is basically in its own psychedelic state and just naturally.
And all kidding aside, I think that the young brain is so subject to
neuroplasticity, that drugs, which like psychedelics which are very
powerful, can be detrimental to the developing brain. That's just my
stance. If anyone disagrees with me, I'd be happy to chat with you
about it in a polite and discourse. I'll be happy to listen as well as
tell you more why I believe that based on the data. I'm mentioning
psychedelics because many of you asked. Here's the deal with
psychedelics. At least here's how they work. In a nutshell,
psychedelics were thought to unleash sensory processing and to make it
less filtered. We have a lot of different inputs from our eyes, from
our ears, from our nose, from our taste, et cetera that you're coming
in all the time in parallel. And we have mechanisms that suppress some
of and allow us to only focus on things that are happening. Visually,
generally we don't have synesthesia unless some of us happen to have
synesthesia. We don't blend what we see with what we hear in a way,
that is confusing to us. We know what's making sounds and we know what
is a visual stimulus. On psychedelics, people report being able to
smell colors or to, you know, hear trees, et cetera. And that's
because there's a lot of sensory blending. Over that's led to the
misconception, that sensory blending itself, is a creative process.
There's nothing creative about sensory blending. You know there's, the
essence of a creative process, is that some novel configuration of
elements, whether or not it's notes on a piano, or whether or not it's
words on a page, whether or not it's numbers or whether or not it's
movement. That some way in which those are configured in some new way,
that the algorithm, the way in which, they are configured makes sense
to the observer. And this is a key thing. It seems to me that when
people report their psychedelic experiences, it makes a lot more sense
to the person who experiences it, than to the observer. And so,
creative works by definition are new ways of configuring things that
lend themselves to a bigger or greater or deeper or novel
understanding on the part of the observer. And just sensory blending
is not gonna accomplish that. Now it is true and there's a great
review in the journal cell, excellent journal about how psychedelics
work. And it turns out, they don't just work, by allowing for more
sensory blending. They do, because of the way that they activate
certain serotonin receptors et cetera. They do lend themselves to more
lateral connectivity between different brain areas, more novel
associations. So in principle, in principle, I should say not
necessarily in practice, but in principle, they do allow different
areas of the brain. Maybe even the two sides of the brain to
communicate more broadly than they would normally. So that has certain
elements that speak to creativity. But, it can't simply be the case
that psychedelics are the portal to creativity. Because creativity, as
I mentioned before, involves not just novel associations and a
breaking of kind of space-time rules, it also involves reconfiguring
things, such that the new space-time rule that one comes up with, is
interesting, stimulating and kind of in many cases, delightful to the
observer. And that's why, many claims that, you know, psychedelics
open plasticity or they increase creativity. That's not sufficient for
me personally. I'm curious about, does it not just open the creative
thinking process, this novel configuration process? But does it also,
lend itself to the implementation of creative works? And the answer
is, no. In most cases it has nothing to do with creative
implementation. Now, I think that, there may come a time and certainly
there are clinical trials that are happening now, where psychedelics
are leveraged toward particular clinical goals. And I wanna tip my hat
to the work at Johns Hopkins that's happening now, which really lends
itself, to the idea that early preliminary data and some of the papers
that are coming out they're really fantastic. Showing that there may
be some excellent roles for certain psychedelics in certain clinical
context. These are clinical studies done with a psychiatrist present,
that is authorized to do that. That can help people through
depression, trauma, et cetera. And we're gonna spend a lot of time
talking about that, including with some of those folks running those
studies. So we can look forward to that. So all of this is to say
that, no I don't take psychedelics to access creative states. That's
not where I think the major role, the important role of psychedelics
might show up if it's going to for humanity. I think that it may have
these important roles in the clinical context. Provided it's done
legally and safely. I think that, the creative process being a two-
stage process means that, I am personally best served by having this
period of non-linear exploration of concepts. Whatever it is I happen
to be working on in the afternoon. But then I'll actually shelve that
work. I'll just set it aside and then I'll revisit it the next day or
even the next day, to see whether or not that the work itself is ready
for deliberate linear implementation which I would wanna do during one
of these highly focused states. So, the long and short way of saying
this is that, when we're very alert, do linear type of operations.
When we tend to be more sleepy and more relaxed, that's when creative
works can first be conceived, but their implementation requires high
levels of alertness. Now, that gets us more to the kind of late
afternoon evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=3500"&gt;Afternoon Light As Insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am, as I mentioned before, I'm a proponent of getting sunlight
in the evening as well. This is a critical thing that I have not
mentioned before. Here's how it works. Many people now have heard me
say getting light early in the day is important. But that will advance
one's clock. It'll make you wanna get up earlier the next day. By
getting light in the evening it accomplishes two things for me. First
of all, it makes sure that I don't get up too early that I'm not
waking up at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning because it's going to shift
my clock. It's going to delay it a little bit. And so this is really
important. If you want to keep your schedule on a normal routine, on a
regular 24 hour cycle and not have your circadian rhythms of sleep and
wakefulness drifting all over the place and you want some
predictability to how your mind is going to work in order to optimize
learning and performance. Well, then you need to get morning light any
evening light. The morning light is going to advance my clock. Make my
system wanna get up earlier. And the evening light is going to delay
my clock a little bit so that on average it kind of bookends my
circadian mechanisms. And I'll basically wanna go to sleep at more or
less the same time each night and wake up, more or less at the same
time each morning. That's how it works. And that's a hard wired
mechanism. That's not some subjective thing that I tell myself. That's
a hardwired mechanism. So, that gets us to the evening. And generally
in the evening I'll get that light by going outside or sometimes I'll
do it by turning up artificial lights brightly, and then I'll start to
dim them for the evening 'cause as I've mentioned many times before
and I'm not gonna belabor the point. You wanna minimize your light
exposure, especially overhead bright light exposure, regardless of
whether or not it's blue light or not. In the evening from about 10:00
PM to 4:00 AM. Some of you asked, wait I thought it was 11:00 PM to
4:00 AM? Well, it is, but 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM is even better. It's
just that when I originally said 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM, people were like
that it's impossible for most people to adhere to. So for me, it
screens off, it's dim lights, and that's what favors falling asleep in
a good night's sleep for me. Since we were talking about food earlier,
I'll just revisit a little bit of what I said before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=3626"&gt;Evening Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My evening meal tends to be more carbohydrate rich more. If I have
proteins, there'll be like eggs, fish or chicken or something of that
sort or no protein. And I eat high carbohydrates. So I'm not one of
these people that's keto or high meat only, or anything like that.
Remember, fasting and low carbohydrate, states facilitate alertness.
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness and sleepiness. They'd
stimulate the release of tryptophan and the transition to sleep. So
that's why I do them late in the day. Also, if you've exercised early
in the day, especially if it's weight bearing exercise or everything's
weight bearing exercises. I suppose unless you're an astronaut. And
you're in space. But if you're early in the day, exercising with
weights or you're doing a long run, sooner or later, you need to
replenish glycogen. And, I realized that the ketonisters out there are
gonna say, well, you know, gluconeogenesis will allow you to replenish
glycogen, et cetera. I'm just gonna call out the lie right now,
because I feel like doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=3681"&gt;Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 'cause I think it just hasn't been stated. Which is that, not
everybody, but a lot of the people that are proponents of high meat
keto diets, fine. That's fine if that's what they wanna do. And as you
recall, I do relatively ketogenic diet during the day, for alertness
or fasting. But a lot of those people, can replenish glycogen really
well without ingesting carbohydrates, so-called gluconeogenesis and
enhance protein synthesis. Because they are hormone enhanced. I've
been around a while. I know what this looks like. They're either
thyroid enhanced or hormone enhanced and I don't pass any judgment.
But when you look at people who look amazing on keto and are able to
have a lot of energy and replenish their glycogen on keto, they are in
many cases, not all, but in many cases they're hormone enhanced.
They're taking exogenous hormones, that allow them to synthesize, and
repair muscle in ways that people who aren't taking those exogenous
hormones can't. This is not just true of the men by the way. This is
also true of the women. And this is a whole discussion into itself
probably not directly related to this month of the podcast. So, I
don't mind that people do this, but one problem is when people are
following ketogenic diets all the way through to sleep and they have
trouble with sleep or they're doing long bouts of fasting and they're
having trouble falling asleep. That makes sense. It's because their
autonomic arousal is tilted towards epinephrine release,
norepinephrine release, and dopamine release. So they have a lot of
energy but they have a hard time calming down and getting into deep
sleep. I tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates and it also
replenishes glycogen. So again, you know, I'm not trying to draw any
fire, but if I do, I'd be happy to have a conversation, about all
that. Again, no judgment, but I think that most people out there are
not aware of some of the other variables. Remember, good science is
about isolating variables. And so oftentimes what we're seeing in
social media, is we're getting presented single variables and we're
not seeing the full context of the other variables that are being
manipulated. So, I eat pasta and rice and vegetables and things like
that in the evening. Also, I just find, maybe I'm becoming one of the
last people that does that. Although I hope not. I hope there are
others out there like me. From all the literature speaks to the fact
that carbohydrates not only do that, but they also help maintain,
healthy thyroid function, et cetera. So that's my bias. That's what I
do. I do avoid caffeine and whatnot in the evening. I do take
supplements and I'll be happy at some point to put out the complete
list of supplements that I take out there. But in general, these are
the core things that I do. And they relate to a lot of the questions
that you've been asking over time. The next piece of scientific data
that I'm gonna describe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=3851"&gt;Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal and Easy To Solve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a very important piece of scientific data, for sake of
understanding how to optimize your brain and access sleep. It also can
help avoid a lot of anxiety issues. And these relate to data from
Charles Czeisler, doctor. He's an MD Charles Czeisler's lab at Harvard
Medical School. He's run a sleep lab out of Harvard Medical School.
For a long time now it has very impressive work. And what he's shown
is that the peak output, of the circadian clock for wakefulness, in
other words the peak of our wakefulness, and the suppression of the
sleep signal, actually happens very late in the day. So we have this
trough of activity and body temperatures lowest right before waking.
Then as we wake up our body temperature goes up and into the afternoon
it continues to go up and then it tends to fall in the evening and
towards bedtime. But there's a brief blip, of release of peptides and
other substances from the sleep centers in the brain, and the
suprachiasmatic nucleus that the sleep center is this preoptic area,
that if you wanna look that up. This preoptic area not far from the
circadian clock that signals the peak of alertness and wakefulness
about an hour, before bedtime. And he say, whoa, that's really weird.
But a lot of people get into bed. They're ready to go to sleep and
they're wide awake. And they think this is an unnatural thing or
there's something wrong with them. And actually it's not. This it's
believed, I don't know, again, I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
But it's believed, is a signal that is helpful to human beings to
start gathering up resources and securing themselves for a night's
sleep during which we, you know, historically were very vulnerable to
attack from other humans and from animals and so forth. And so that
desire to run around and clean the kitchen or organize things, or just
a general feeling of internal anxiety, late in the evening, that's a
natural blip that naturally passes after about 45 to 60 minutes. Now
that's often the time when people start stressing about the fact that
they have something to do the next day and they worry about not being
able to sleep and it can cascade into a whole set of things. So
another thing that I do throughout my day is I know that early day I'm
gonna be alert, afternoon I'm gonna be kinda sleepy. And then as the
evening comes around, in addition to doing all the other things I'm
doing, I anticipate, a peak in alertness in activity. And I don't
worry about it. I use that perhaps to get organized for the next day
but basically, I just go through, if I'm gonna do anything, it's gonna
be very mundane task like cleaning or things that require almost zero
effort. And that probably speaks to my cleaning abilities too. But,
the fact of the matter is we don't just go drift off into sleep.
There's this blip of alertness right before sleep that I hope just
cognitively knowing about will be helpful to people. And that raises,
yet another theme that I think is going to be very important. Which
is, physiological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=4028"&gt;The Power of Objective Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like these changes in alertness. Or using breathing tools. Something
we'll talk about in future episodes to shift our levels of autonomic
arousal. Those are concrete, biological phenomenon. So is fasting.
Fasting will increase alertness that way. So is caffeine. Not
everybody's susceptible to caffeine to the same degree of others But,
it's a physiological mechanisms. We know the receptors. We know the
ligands as they're called which bind to the receptors. We know the
mechanisms. They involve cortisol and epinephrine. Those are the sorts
of things that I personally try and leverage, toward my learning and
optimization of my brain, and my activity. Doing physical activity
early in the day for instance, tends to give us a longer duration,
wake up signal, intends to accelerate waking up early in the day.
That's why working out late in the day can sometimes cause people to
have trouble falling asleep. It will also phase delay. You make it so
that you wanna wake up later the next day. It's not just 'cause you're
tired. It's 'cause you shifted your clock with activity and
temperature. Many people ask me about subjective tools for plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=4094"&gt;Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about visualization? Can we just imagine doing a particular
activity, will that help us get better at that activity? There's some
evidence that visualization can do that, it's true. But here's the
important distinction. And here's why I personally, don't do much,
deliberate visualization. First of all, I get my best ability, or
achieve my best ability to visualize things when I'm in kind of a
sleepy state. I don't know why but that's when I'm able to, direct my
brain towards internal visualization with my eyes closed. And
generally I fall asleep and I can't remember anything that I was
thinking about before. Some people, and these are work that was done
many years ago by Roger Shephard and by others. Roger was at Stanford
but and other labs have done this too, of course, of rotating objects
physically in their mind, as a way of improving or looking at the
speed of spatial calculations and so forth. Some people are very good
at visualization. They can close their eyes and they can just see
objects and rotate them deliberately, et cetera. A lot of people like
me, when we start doing that, our mind drifts too easily. But I like
to think I'm a reasonably focused person in the waking state. So,
visualization it's interesting 'cause I think people are very
attracted to the idea, that they can just think about something and
then get better at it that way. And it's probably true, if you can be
very linear in the way that you visualize things. So I wanna repeat
that. I think visualization does have certain power. If you can remain
very linear and deliberate and focused, in the visualization. But many
people like myself who are challenged, with maintaining that linear
focus with eyes closed, and in visualization, they don't get much out
of visualization. And I think the data on performance really supports
that. Now there are examples where for instance, people will injure
one limb and then they will exercise the intact limb, or the non-
injured limb rather. And they will visualize the opposite limb.
Sometimes there's even the use of mirror boxes. So that let's say my
left limb is injured. I'm maintaining activity with my right limb but
I'm using a mirror box so it looks like my left limb is working well.
Yes, there's some top-down or feedback mechanisms, that support the
idea that the injured limb can rehabilitate more quickly, et cetera.
But, those are fairly elaborate schemes. I don't want a mirror boxes
around my house. I think these are specialized circumstances. They're
a little bit like the examples that we see in the news where, oh, so-
and-so has a stroke and then spontaneously speaks a new language. I
don't know what the answer to that is. It shows that the brain has
associative networks that are typically suppressed and those can be
unleashed. But you certainly don't wanna go out and give yourself a
stroke deliberately to try and unmask some skill, because there's no
concrete way to go about that in a way that you could really know that
you were gonna offset the detrimental effects of the stroke. In fact,
I think it'd be a terrible idea. So I think what I'm trying to
describe is how a typical, I don't know if I'm typical or normal. I
mean, I've been told otherwise, and certainly not normal. But in terms
of the way that I structure my day, I think that's normal. That's
pretty normal. I tend to wake up right around, I don't know,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=4294"&gt;Mini-Synthesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;somewhere between 5:30 and 7:00 AM, depending on what I've been doing
the night before. I tend to go to sleep somewhere around 10:30, 11:00.
I tend to have one bout in the morning where I can do really focused
hard work and I can really activate the go pathway while also
activating the no-go pathway so that I can really stay focused. But I
rely on some tools. I have a period in the afternoon where I get
sleepy and kinda out of it like I think most people. And I tend to
come out of that recognizing the opportunity of that slightly sleepy
state for creative work and for thinking about things in novel ways. I
get light a couple of times a day. I eat low carb during the day, and
I don't say high, but you know, higher carbs I eat starches, in the
evening. So in a way I can sleep. And then, I really anticipate that
late afternoon peak and alertness. Excuse me, late night peak and
alertness that many people confuse for insomnia or challenges when
actually they're really quite normal in their circadian cycle. And
then I fall asleep. And if all goes well, I stay asleep for four or
five hours. Typically it's three or four and then I wake up. I think
I'm like most people I wake up during the middle of the night. Now,
one thing that I don't think has been discussed a lot but one of my
colleagues at the Stanford sleep lab tells me is that, every hour and
a half or so, we all wake up. Some of you even look around, believe it
or not and go right back to sleep. And you don't recognize it. Waking
up periodically during sleep is the norm. It is not abnormal. I don't
know why this hasn't been discussed more prominently. I tend to wake
up and if there's a bright light coming through the blinds, or if
there's some noise upstairs, if Costello's snoring particularly loud,
I might get up, I might, go use the restroom. I might, you know, pick
up a book and read under low light or something and then I generally
fall back asleep and wake up, typical time for me again, 5:30 or 7:00
AM in the morning. This waking up in the middle of the night thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=4411"&gt;Resetting Your Clock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as I mentioned at the beginning of the podcast episode today, is not
necessarily abnormal. What it probably reflects, is that the real time
meaning, the time that I should go to sleep is probably closer to
eight o'clock. The word midnight was literally supposed to mean mid
night. We, many meaning all of us were meant to go to sleep and wake
up with the rise, you know, with the setting and rising of the sun.
And we know this because this beautiful study from University of
Colorado, where they took people out into the wilderness to reset
their circadian clocks, measured by way of melatonin and cortisol.
They were completely out of whack from interacting with screens and
staying up too late, et cetera. And they basically had them view the
sunrise and view the sunset each evening and almost all of them not
all of those students, but all of them, got onto a schedule where they
naturally wanted to go to sleep at sunset and wake up around sunrise
or just before sunrise, even when they were brought back into a normal
artificial light setting. So I think that's the natural pattern and
we've just deviated from it with artificial lights. So waking up at
3:00 AM or 4:00 AM doesn't necessarily mean that there's something
screwed up about you. Or that you have anxiety or something, although
you might. What it likely means is that you were supposed to go to bed
much earlier. And because of this asymmetry in the autonomic nervous
system where it's much easier for us to push, and to delay our sleep
time than it is to accelerate our wake-up time. In other words, it's
easier to stay up and hang out at the party even if you don't wanna be
there than it is to wake up when you're exhausted and your fast sleep.
Most people are pushing through, into the late hours of the evening
and night and going to bed much later than they naturally would want
to. And so I personally don't want to go to bed at 8:00 PM. A lot of
good things happen between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM. And so, I wanna enjoy
those. And I push through the evening hours. But as a consequence, I'm
running out of melatonin. My melatonin release is basically subsided
by about 3:00 or 4:00 AM and so it makes sense that I would wake up. I
don't take melatonin for reasons discussed in previous episodes. I do
rely on things like magnesium glycinate or magnesium threonate, things
like theanine. I'm not saying any of you need to take those. That's
just what I happened to take in order to facilitate my sleep. And it's
been of great benefit to me. If I wake up in the middle of the night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=4555"&gt;Don’t Trust the Mind Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I'm anxious for whatever reason or my mind is looping, I have a
couple of rules. One is, I don't trust anything I think about. When I
wake up in the middle of the night, any of it. Unless I've had a
magnificent dream and I wanna write it down, I'll do that every once
in a while. Typically when I go back and read it, it's not at all
magnificent. I can't ever remember coming up with anything really
fantastic in one of my dreams that stuck with me, or that I
implemented. I don't really trust the kind of thinking that happens in
those wee hours of the circadian cycle for me. There's just nothing
either for me terribly creative, or worth linear implementation at
that time. But, one thing that has been very helpful is to sometimes
do one of these non sleep deep rest protocols as a way to go back into
sleep. So a hypnosis app or some of the scripts by Michael Sealey that
I've mentioned before, or the Reveri Health, or a yoga nidra protocol.
Those for me have been very useful at helping me turn off, kinda
looping thinking in the middle of the night and fall back asleep. In
reviewing my schedule for you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=4619"&gt;Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just as a context for how to implement certain types of tools for
optimizing learning. Realize that, it gives the impression that
there's a 90 minute bout of learning and work in the morning and then
a 90 minute bout of creative type work in the afternoon and that's it.
There are a lot of hours in between of course, and I just wanna be
very clear. Those hours for me are occupied by pretty not mundane
tasks but things that are kinda random. Those are things like email or
attending to Zoom meetings or meeting with colleagues and students and
things of that sort. I sometimes will read just for sake of my own
enrichment. I mentioned those two 90 minute bouts because those are
the two 90 minute bouts where I'm trying to expand on, the mental
capacities that I already have. They're to really where I'm trying to
stretch and grow what I'm able to do on a regular basis reflexively.
So I wanna emphasize that the whole day doesn't just consist of those
two 90 minute bouts. That's not the way my schedule works and that's
not the way my lifestyle is arranged. Which is fortunate 'cause I
enjoy all those other things as well. And so for many of you out there
who are in school or have family demands or other demands, the key is
to slot in those brain optimization segments of about 90 minutes, one
or two, or maybe more per day. You're trying to slot those in wherever
you can amidst to your other, obligations and things that you need to
do. But, you wanna do that in an intelligent way that's anchored to
your biology. And then you wanna do a number of things which I've
talked about today, in order to optimize those sessions to get the
most out of them. So as we round up, I acknowledged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=4713"&gt;Organizational Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that once again I've covered a huge range of topics, related to how to
optimize learning, and brain change, and essentially mental
performance. And I've set that in the context, of some biological
mechanism like the basal ganglia, go, no-go pathways, the circadian
autonomic system, and some of the relationship between food and
fasting and particular types of food in alertness or sleepiness.
Linear focus and strategy implementation is best served by high alert
states, although not too alert, and how creative states, at least the
first phase of creativity, which is the creative arrangement, kind of
brainstorming stage is supported by states of kind of relaxation or
even slightly sleepy. But the creative implementation is a very linear
and focused and deliberate process, much like the highly focused
state, that I described. I described how I do these things so just to
give you a context. A lot of you asked for, you know, what I do in
order to set it within a context. But by no means are these rigid
times and ways of doing things. But, I think it's fair to say that,
what I do has a circadian logic. It also has grounding in biological
mechanisms that are very concrete. That we know the cells and
mechanisms and neuro-transmitters. And then some of them are a little
bit headed out into the, what we would call, kind of emerging, or, you
know, I don't wanna say cutting edge, but maybe front edge of what
neuroscience is starting to understand about creativity and so forth.
Those are areas that are just now, coming to some clarity. And there
is certainly is still a lot more work to do. There are a lot of
different ways to arrange one's routine. But hopefully, the tools and
practices I described, will be useful to you. I wanna mention that a
lot of people ask me about specific tools and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=4822"&gt;Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked me of Wim Hof Breathing, about ice baths. Have talked a
little bit about ice baths before I think in cold exposure. About
binaural beats and things of those sorts. I think the way to look at
any tool, to modulate or measure the nervous system, is ask whether or
not it's going to move you up or down, the state of autonomic arousal.
Whether or not it's gonna can make you more alert or more calm. More
focused or less focused. That's kind of the two axes here that we need
to think about. Sometimes you wanna be more alert than you are. And
indeed, things like cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, Wim
Hof type breathing, will bring your level of alertness up. There's
some cautionary notes associated with each of those. You need to read
and understand those cautionary notes, for yourself. Everybody's
different and some of those carry certain dangers, under certain
conditions. Others have huge margins for safety. An ice bath generally
wakes you up. A warmer, hot bath generally calms you down, right?
Binaural beats, there aren't a lot of data and quality peer-reviewed
journals. I did put in the effort to go search it out. There are a
few. Binaural beats are listening to frequencies of sound that
slightly differ offset for the two ears. It has been shown, can shift
the brain into particular states. You'll notice today, I didn't really
talk about alpha or theta or gamma rhythms. I personally in reviewing
the literature, I don't think it's fair to say that alpha states are
great for X and theta states are great for Y. And besides, most of us
aren't walking around our homes and our workplaces, geared up to EEG
machines or with wires down below our skull. So we don't know when
we're in those states anyway. I think the subjective reading of
whether or not one is alert, or calm, and whether or not that
alertness or calmness matches the goal or that thing that we're trying
to achieve in terms of learning, including sleep, is the most
valuable, internal tool and recognition that we can all have. In other
words, if I want to be very alert and I need to be very alert and I'm
exhausted, there might be tools that I should use to wake up. It might
also speak to the fact that I might not have slept as well as I could
have or should have the night before. So it's really about a match
between where we are on that autonomic arousal scale and what we're
trying to achieve. And indeed, there are gonna be a lot of tools
including supplements and other prescription drugs and things that can
help, move us along that autonomic continuum, up toward more alertness
or toward more calmness. But ultimately it's about tailoring that
alertness and calmness to the specific types of learning and
activities that you are going to do and perform. And, it's reciprocal.
Meaning some of those activities like exercise early in the day will
increase your level of autonomic arousal and alertness. Certain foods,
will tend to wake you up. Certain foods will tend to make you more
sleepy and the volume of food and the timing of food is a factor also.
So it's a huge parameter space. It's a huge set of variables, that
impacts whether or not we're feeling well, performing well, learning
great, or not learning great. And the key thing is to become an
observer, of your own system and what works for you. And, to recognize
that there are two bins of tools for optimizing, learning and brain
performance. One, are tools that are really anchored in biological
mechanism and we are certain of what those are. I've talked about some
of those. The other, the more subjective tools, for some of you
visualization, might work terrifically well. For some of you, one song
might really wake you up because of the associations you have with it.
And for me, I might just, you know, it might repel me from the room.
'Cause I don't like it or it might put me to sleep. But of course,
volume is kind of a universal. Loud music tends to wake people up.
Soft music, doesn't tend to wake them up quite as much. So, part of
today is really getting you to think about, in a scientific way, in a
structured way, about the non-negotiable elements which are that
you're going to have a period of every 24 hour cycle when you tend to
be more awake, and a period when you tend to be more asleep. And how
to leverage those so you're not fighting an uphill battle to wake up
when you actually, would want to be in and should be sleepy and not
trying to go to sleep when you are naturally, going to be most awake.
So a lot of it is really anchors back to those core mechanisms of
biology, and then you start layering on the different protocols of
food and supplementation, et cetera. And I think it's important to
recognize that some people are just more go and no-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=5082"&gt;Variation Among People, and Dogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some people, are just calmer and have a harder time getting into
action in an activity. It's just the way that we're wired. Some of us
have autonomic nervous systems that are more geared towards
parasympathetic, calm states. One of the reasons I love bulldogs, not
just my bulldog, is that they are very calm animals. In fact, they
make no spontaneous movements unless there's something to respond to.
And I find that incredibly relaxing. Other animals like pit bulls, who
I also really like and enjoy and other species, their tail is always
wagging. And that they're always in a position to make a movement at
any any second 'cause they tend to ride at pretty high levels of
autonomic arousal. They pop up really quickly. When you say it's time
to go for a walk, Costello does it one limb at a time. And sometimes
he just goes back to sleep. And so, that there are people like that
too. And so you have to know where you are and what particular goals
you're trying to pursue. As a final closure to this, I wanna emphasize
that today as always, I've strived to be accurate. I'm sure if I made
mistakes, some of you will point out and I appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=5149"&gt;Accurate Versus Exhaustive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'll post a correction, if we agree that I indeed misspoke, or
misguided something. But, by no means was I exhaustive. I mean, I
might've exhausted some of you but the information wasn't exhaustive.
Meaning, there's no way that I could cover all the ways in which, we
optimize or can optimize learning and performance. I think we've
touched on a number of them that I hope, that you'll find value in and
that you'll explore in your own lives. We are continuing with this
theme because that's what we do, for this podcast. We stay on one
theme for an entire month. For the next episode, we're going to
explore two, very essential aspects of neuroplasticity. That actually
relate to learning. Which are pain, pain management, and neural
regeneration. And for those of you that, don't have injuries or don't
suffer from chronic pain, the discussion is still gonna be a very
important one. Because it's not just going to be about pain that
you're trying to get rid of. It's also going to be about how certain
sensory experiences, within the pain network, can become amplified, as
well as how we can use top-down modulation. We can use our mind, to
suppress the pain response. We're also gonna talk about some of the
hardwired mechanisms, that are bottom up, that exist in our periphery,
in our body to control pain. And we're also gonna discuss, a number of
interesting interactions between the pain system and the learning
system. So again if you're, not interested in pain per se, it still is
going to be a very valid conversation for sake of understanding how to
optimize brain performance. And neuro-regeneration goes hand in hand,
with that discussion. So I hope you'll join us for that. I suppose I'd
be remiss if I didn't mention that, Costello has been snoring
extremely loudly today. He had a good long walk this morning which
means up the driveway down the driveway. He's an old dog. So if you've
been hearing him in the background and it's been distracting, now you
know why. It probably relates to, where you were on your level of
autonomic arousal. And I'll leave it to you to answer that question
for yourself. Many of you continue to graciously ask how you can help
support the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuP-1ioh4LY&amp;amp;t=5277"&gt;Familiar and New Ways To Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we really appreciate the question. The best way is to subscribe
wherever it is you happen to be listening or watching. So for those of
you that it's YouTube, please subscribe to the YouTube channel. If
it's Apple, subscribe to the podcast on Apple or if it's Spotify,
subscribe there. Maybe you've subscribed to all three. If you have
comments and feedback for us, suggestions for future podcast, episodes
or topics to cover, please, place those in the comment section on
YouTube. Apple also provides a section where you can give us a rating.
We would love it if you give us a five star rating or whatever it is
that you feel that we deserve. And in general, if you could tell
people about the podcast, we hope that you would tell them because you
think the information will be of use to them of course. Tell your
friends, tell your family, tell your coworkers, because as we expand
the podcast, the support for the podcast just grows along with it. So
that's a terrific way to support us. As always, check out our sponsors
which were mentioned at the beginning. And in addition to that, we've
now set up a Patreon account. Some of you asked specifically, how you
can help support the podcast but you weren't interested, in our
sponsors or you were already engaged with our sponsors. So, we have a
Patreon account. You can find it at patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
Finally, in previous episodes today, and in future episodes, I
mentioned supplements. Supplements are one way, certainly not the only
way, but they're one way in which we can modulate, our nervous system,
for sake of better of sleep, learning, alertness, and several other
things as well. If you're interested in supplements, we've partnered
with Thorne, T H O R N E, because Thorne supplements have very high
stringency in terms of, what's in the bottle, the amounts of the
substances that are in each capsule or pill, et cetera. And, they have
partnered with other groups such as the Mayo Clinic, all the major
sports teams. So there's very high rigor associated with Thorne which
is why we've decided to partner with them. If you'd like to check out
Thorne supplements and see the supplements that I take, you can go to
Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman. And you'll see a list of some of the
supplements that I take. As well, you'll get 20% off, any of the
supplements listed there, as well as anywhere else on the Thorne
website. So that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman, for 20% off, any
Thorne supplements. Last but not least, on behalf of me and Costello,
I wanna thank you for your time and attention today. And as always,
thank you for your interest in science. [upbeat music]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. My name is Andrew Huberman, and
I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School
of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research
roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to
bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-
related tools. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Headspace. Headspace
is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating
on and off now for about 30 years, although I confess more off than
on. And that's because I think like, for a lot of people, sticking to
a meditation practice can be pretty challenging. I started using
Headspace a few years ago and I found that it's really allowed me to
stick to a meditation practice on a regular basis. I meditate anywhere
from five to seven times a week. The app includes meditations that are
all backed by scientific peer-reviewed studies. And it makes it really
easy to start and complete the meditations. I started using these
meditations while I was flying a few years back. On JetBlue flights,
they started offering Headspace meditations. That's where I initially
started. And then I moved over to the app, and I really enjoy it and I
derive great benefit from it. If you'd like to try Headspace, you can
go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get all
the meditations that Headspace offers for free for one month. That's
headspace.com/specialoffer. You get all the meditations for free,
which is the best offer that they has available right now. So if
you're interested in it, check it out. The second sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink. I started using Athletic Greens in 2012, and
I've been using it continuously ever since. I started using Athletic
Greens because I found it rather dizzying to know which vitamins and
minerals to take. And Athletic Greens allows me to get the full base
of all the necessary vitamins and minerals in one easy to consume
drink. It also turns out that the drink tastes quite good. I mix mine
with some lemon juice and some water, I drink it once or twice a day.
The probiotics in Athletic Greens are also important to me because
there are a lot of data now supporting the fact that the gut
microbiome is important for the gut-brain axis for various aspects of
cognitive function, immune function, metabolic function. There's just
a huge number of things that having a healthy gut microbiome has been
shown to be important for. So by taking Athletic Greens, I have that
base covered as well. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go
to athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, they'll give you a
year supply of liquid vitamin D3 K2. There are also a lot of data now
showing that vitamin D3 is very important for a number of different
biological functions. In addition, they'll give you five free travel
packs with your order. It can be difficult to mix up powders while on
the road, when in a car, or in a hotel, or on a plane, et cetera. The
travel packs make everything really clean and easy. So you'll get the
year supply of vitamin D3 K2 plus the five free travel packs if you go
to athleticgreens.com/huberman. The third sponsor of today's podcast
is Madefor. Madefor is behavioral science company that makes learning
positive habits and growth mindset easy. I've been involved with
Madefor since the beginning as the lead of their scientific advisory.
Other members of the scientific advisory include, for instance, the
head of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of Mental
Health, as well as psychiatrists from Harvard Medical School and
elsewhere, all of whom are serious about science and science-related
tools for developing positive habits and growth mindset. The program
is a 10 month-program, during which each month you engage in a
specific activity designed to encourage and cultivate positive habits
and growth mindset. As well, we hold a monthly Zoom call, during which
we discuss the program, people's progress, and answer any questions
they have directly. If you'd like to try Madefor, you can go to
getmadefor.com, and if you put Huberman in at checkout, you'll get 20%
off the program. That's getmadefor.com, put Huberman in at checkout,
and get 20% off the program. Today, we're going to talk about how to
change your nervous system for the better. As you recall, your nervous
system includes your brain and your spinal cord, but also all the
connections that your brain and spinal cord make with the organs of
your body and all the connections that the organs of your body make
with your brain and spinal cord. This thing that we call the nervous
system is responsible for everything we know, all our behavior, all
our emotions, everything we feel about ourselves and the outside
world, everything we think and believe. It's really at the center of
our entire experience of life and who we are. Fortunately, in humans,
unlike in other species, we can change our nervous system by taking
some very specific and deliberate actions. And, today, we're really
going to focus on the actions, the motor commands and the aspects of
movement and balance that allow us to change our nervous system. It
turns out that movement and balance actually provide windows or
portals into our ability to change our nervous system the way we want,
even if those changes are not about learning new movements or learning
how to balance. And soon you'll understand why. So, today, we're going
to talk a lot about the basic science of neuroplasticity. I promise to
not use excessive nomenclature. There'll be a little bit, but I'll try
and make it as clear as possible. And we're also going to talk a lot
about protocols and tools that the scientific literature points to and
support for changing our nervous system, again, not just for sake of
learning new motor movements or how to balance better, but for how to
feel differently about particular experiences, both past, present, and
future, and as well as how to learn faster. We're not going to discuss
hacks, a word I loath, we're not going to discuss gimmicks, we're
going to discuss mechanism and scientific data and the tools that
those mechanisms and scientific data point to so that you can tailor
your practices around learning to your specific needs and goals. So
let's begin by just examining&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=380"&gt;Nerves and Muscles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the big picture question which is, does the brain control behavior?
And my hope is that everyone is immediately thinking yes. The brain
and nervous system, we really should say, 'cause the brain is just one
component of the nervous system, controls our behavior. How does it do
that? Well, there are a couple different levels that it does that.
First of all, if we're talking about movement, behavior generally
means movement, if we're talking about movement, we have two
categories of neurons that are very important to think about in the
context of neuroplasticity. First of all, we have what are called
lower motor neurons. These are motor neurons that live in our spinal
cord. For the aficionados out there, for those of you that might be
headed to medical school or just want to learn more about the anatomy,
they live in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. But that doesn't
matter if you don't want to know that, just know that you have these
things called lower motor neurons. These are neurons that are in the
spinal cord but they extend a wire that we call an axon out into the
peripheral nervous system, into the body. And those neurons connect
with muscle. They send electrical potentials out there that allow our
muscles to twitch into contract. As a little point of fact, actually,
we don't have muscle memory. There's no such thing as muscle memory.
Muscles are dumb. They don't know anything, they don't have a history,
they don't have a memory, they don't know anything. It is the neurons
that control those muscles and their firing patterns in which all the
information for motor patterns are stored. So your ability to walk is
not muscle memory, it's neural memory. Now, the lower motor neurons,
while smarter than the muscle so to speak, are not the most brilliant
of the motor neurons. They are generally involved in doing what they
are told, and they are told what to do from two sources. We have
circuits in our brainstem, so this would be kind of around your neck
deep in the brain, that are called central pattern generators. These
are sometimes called CPGs. Central pattern generators are what allow
us to generate repetitive patterns of movement. So inhaling and
exhaling, inhaling and exhaling subconsciously is controlled by a
central pattern generator. That just means a collection of neurons. If
you really want to know, they're called the pre-Botzinger neurons
discovered by Jack Feldman and colleagues at UCLA. These neurons in
the brainstem send information down the phrenic nerve and control the
diaphragm. And it goes inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. And you don't
have to think about that. You could think about it and you could
change the durations of inhales and exhales and change that up, but
the motor neurons that control that are just responding to what the
brain is telling it to do. The other central pattern generators
include things like walking. The right limb-left limb, right limb-left
limb pattern that we normally associate with walking was learned
during childhood, and these central pattern generators, sometimes
called CPGs, tell our lower motor neurons, "Fire. Now you fire, now
you fire." So they are literally saying, "Right, left, right left."
They are the marching orders from the brainstem to the lower motor
neurons. So these lower motor neurons do what they are told. They are
obedient little soldiers and they do what they are told, and their job
is to make the muscles contract at specific times. Okay. That's all
simple. But then there are the upper motor neurons. The upper motor
neurons actually reside in our motor cortex, way up on top of the
brain. And they are involved in sending signals for deliberate action.
So they send signals to the lower motor neurons which are the
effectors, the ones that actually control the muscles, but the upper
motor neurons are the ones that send very specific signals. For
instance, the signals that would allow you to make a cup of coffee in
the morning or to deliberately engage in any kind of behavior. Now,
you can probably make a cup of coffee in the morning without having to
think about it too much. It's almost reflexive for you now, which
means that a lot of the information about how to perform that
particular movement has been passed off to circuitry that's now more
or less in the brainstem and below the motor cortex. Now, why am I
giving you all this detail? Well, if you want to change motor
patterns, you have to know where in the circuitry changes are possible
and you ought to know where the changes are most likely to occur. You
also need to know, how do you signal to the brain and nervous system
that a change is necessary? So let's just pause there, return to the
initial question that we started with, which is, does the brain
control behavior? And the answer is yes, and now you know how. It's
upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons, you've got these things
called central pattern generators and some connection with the muscle.
So there you go, you just got, basically, what was the equivalent of
the introduction to a college lecture on motor control and the nervous
system. But the point today is all about plasticity. How can that be
leveraged in order to open up this magical thing that we call
plasticity in order to access changes to our emotional experience, or
to our belief system, or to our ability to remember and use specific
kinds of information for say math, or language, et cetera? Well, what
I'm not going to tell you is that you need to go running or you need
to go biking, or that simply going through motor patterns is going to
open up plasticity because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=720"&gt;Exercise alone won’t change your brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to tell you this, but as beneficial as exercise is, it does not
open plasticity unless you do certain things. And I will tell you
exactly what those certain things are today. To be clear, I think
exercise is wonderful and healthy, can improve cardiovascular
function, maintain strength, bone density, all that good stuff. But
just working out or doing your exercise of various kinds will not
change your nervous system. It will maintain it, and it can certainly
improve other health metrics, but it is not going to open up the
window for plasticity. The question we need to ask is can behavior
change the brain? We already agree that the brain can change behavior,
but can behavior change the brain? And the answer is yes, provided
that behavior is different enough in specific ways from the behaviors
that you already know how to perform. Let me repeat that. Can behavior
change the brain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=778"&gt;Behavior will change your brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the answer is yes, provided that behavior is different enough from
the sorts of behaviors that you already know how to perform. And I
should've added the word well. Because you can't obviously perform a
behavior that you don't know how to perform because you don't know how
to do it yet. But there's a key element to accessing neuroplasticity
that frankly I don't see out there in the general discussion about
neuroplasticity. In the general discussion about neuroplasticity and
about learning, I hear all these gimmicks about using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=810"&gt;Remembering the wrong things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;different ways to remember lots of people's names and arranging things
into their first letters and mnemonics and all this kind of stuff,
which, frankly, to me feels really gimmicky. I think that if you look
at super learners, they tend to be people that have a process of say
extreme memory. But people who have extreme memory, generally, the
literature shows us, are pretty poor at other things. I don't think
most of us are interested in walking around knowing how to remember
everything. In fact, there are some interesting studies looking at
humans who over-remember, and they suffer tremendously because they
remember all sorts of things, like the number at the top of the
receipt at the bodega that they bought a Coca-Cola 10 years ago. This
is useless information for most people. They don't do well in life,
really. So the goal isn't to remember everything, the goal is to be
selective about your brain changes. And when we talk about brain
changes, I want to highlight adaptive changes. There's a whole
category of things that we're going to discuss when we talk about
traumatic brain injury and dementia, a topic for a future episode,
about all the things that happen when you have damaged your nervous
system or you're missing neurons. But, today, I really want to talk
about something that I think is very near and dear to many of your
hearts, which is what are the behaviors that you can engage in to
access neuroplasticity so that then you can apply that plasticity to
the specific things that you want to learn or unlearn. This is very
important because I don't want people to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=900"&gt;Behavior as the gate to plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;get the impression that we're really talking about learning a bunch of
motor movements. You may be an athlete, you might not be an athlete.
You might want to learn how to dance, you might not. You might want to
learn how to dance and get better at remembering and learning
languages, for instance, or at unlearning some difficult emotional
experience, meaning you want to remove the emotional load from a
particular memory of an experience. What we're talking about today is
using behavior as a gate to enter states of mind and body that allow
you to access plasticity. So let's talk about the different kinds of
plasticity that are available to us. Because those will point directly
towards the type of protocols that we should engage in to change
ourselves for the better, the so-called adaptive plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=945"&gt;Types of Plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something called representational plasticity.
Representational plasticity is just your internal representation of
the outside world. So you have a map of auditory space, believe it or
not, meaning you have neurons that respond when something over on my
right happens, like I'm [snaps fingers] snapping my fingers over to my
right. I can't snap as well on my left, which is the whole thing unto
itself. [snaps fingers] Yeah, weak over there on the left side. But
when I do that, there are different neurons respond to those. We have
a map of visual space. Certain neurons are seeing things in certain
portions of visual space and not others. We have a map of motor space,
meaning when we move our limbs in particular directions, we know where
those limbs are because even if we can't see them, we have what's
called proprioceptive feedback. So we have knowledge about where our
limbs are. In fact, people that lack certain neurons for
proprioceptive feedback, they are very poor at controlling their motor
behavior. They get injured a lot. It's actually a terrible situation.
So we've got all these representations inside and we have maps of our
motor commands. We know that, for instance, if I want to reach out and
grab the pen in front of me, that I need to generate a certain amount
of force. So I rarely overshoot, I rarely miss the pen. Our maps of
the motor world and our maps of the sensory world are merged. The way
to create plasticity is to create mismatches or errors in how we
perform things. And this I think is an amazing and important feature
of neuroplasticity that is highly underappreciated. The way to create
plasticity is to send signals to the brain that something is wrong,
something is different, and something isn't being achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=1052"&gt;Errors Not Flow Trigger Plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this will completely reframe the way that most people think
about plasticity. Most of us think about plasticity as, "Okay, we're
going to get into this optimal learning state or flow, and then
suddenly we're going to be able to do all the things that we wish that
we could do." Well, I hate to break it to you, but flow is an
expression of what we already know how to do. It is not a state for
learning. And I'm willing to go to bat with any of the flo-wa-nis-tas
out there that want to challenge me on that one. Flow is an expression
of nervous system capabilities that are already embedded in us. Errors
and making errors out of sync with what we would like to do is how our
nervous system is cued through very distinct biological mechanisms
that something isn't going right. And, therefore, certain
neurochemicals are deployed that signal the neural circuits that they
have to change. So let's talk about the experiments that support what
I just said. 'Cause I'm about to tell you that making errors over and
over and over again is the route to shaping your nervous system so
that it performs better and better and better. And I'm not going to
tell you that the last rep of a set where you hit failure in the gym
is anything like neuroplasticity. You hear that too that it's pushing
to that point of a cliff where you just can't function anymore, that's
the signal. That's not the signal. That's a distinct neuromuscular
phenomenon that bears zero resemblance to what it takes to get
neuroplasticity. So let's talk about errors and making errors and why
and how that triggers the release of chemicals that then allow us to
not just learn the thing that we're doing in the motor sense, play the
piano, dance, et cetera, but it also creates an environment, a milieu
within the brain, that allows us to then go learn how to couple or
uncouple a particular emotion to an experience, or better language
learning, or better mathematical learning. It's a really fundamental
aspect of how we're built. And when you look at it, it's actually very
straightforward. It's a series of logical steps that once you learn
how to open those hatches, it becomes very straightforward to deploy.
Last episode, we discussed some of the basic principles of
neuroplasticity. If you didn't hear that episode, no problem, I'll
just review it quickly, which is that it's a falsehood that everything
that we do and experience changes our brain. The brain changes when
certain neurochemicals, namely acetylcholine, epinephrin, and
dopamine, are released in ways and in the specific times that allow
for neural circuits to be marked for change. And then the change
occurs later during sleep. I'll review that later, but, basically, you
need a certain cocktail of chemicals released in the brain in order
for a particular behavior to reshape the way that our brain works. So
the question really is what allows those neurochemicals to be
released? And last episode, I talked all about focus. If you haven't
seen it or heard that episode, you might want to check it out, about
some specific tools and practices that can allow you to build up your
capacity for focus and release certain chemicals in that cocktail.
But, today, we're going to talk about the other chemicals in the
cocktail, in particular dopamine. And we're really going to center our
discussion around this issue of making errors and why making errors is
actually the signal that tells the brain, "Okay, it's time to change,"
or, more generally, it's time to pay attention to things so that you
change. And I really want to distinguish this point really clearly,
which is that I'm going to talk today a lot about motor and
vestibular, meaning balance programs, but not just for learning motor
commands and balance, not just for learning new motor skills and
balance, but also for setting a stage or a kind of condition in your
brain where you can go learn other things as well. Let's talk about
some classic experiments that really nail down what's most important
in this discussion about plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=1290"&gt;Mechanisms of Plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned last episode, and I'll just tell you right now again,
the brain is incredibly plastic from about birth until about age 25.
Passive experience will shape the brain just because of the way that
the chemicals that are sloshing around in there and the way that the
neurons are arranged and all sorts of things. The brain's job is to
customize itself in response to its experience. And then somewhere
about 25, it's not like the day after your 26th birthday, plasticity
closes, there's a kind of tapering off of plasticity, and you need
different mechanisms to engage plasticity as an adult. We're mostly
going to be talking about adult plasticity today, but I got a lot of
questions about, "Well, what about if I'm younger than 25?" First of
all, that's great. I wish I had a time machine, but I don't. Because
as I've said before, the stinger is when you're young, your brain is
very plastic, but you have less control over your experience. When
you're older, generally,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=1350"&gt;What to learn when you are young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you have more control of your experience, but your brain is less
plastic. So if you're already asking the question as a 20-year-old or
a 15-year-old, "What can I do now that's really going to enhanced my
brain?" I guess the simple answer would be an aside, which would be
get the broadest education you can possible. That means math,
chemistry, physics, literature, music, learn how to play an
instrument. I'm saying that 'cause I wish I had, et cetera. Get a
broad training in a number of things and find the thing that really
captures your passion and excitement, and then put a ton of additional
effort there. That's what I recommend, including emotional
development. Maybe a topic for a future episode. But if you are an
adult, or if you are a young person, knowing how to tap into these
plasticity mechanisms is very powerful. You need these chemicals
deployed in the nervous system in order to mark whatever nerve cells
happen to be firing in the time afterward for change. And people are
obsessed with asking, "What supplements, what drugs, what conditions,
what machines will allow for that?" But there's a natural set of
conditions that allow for that. When we came into this world, we
learned to take our different maps of experience, our motor maps, our
auditory maps, our visual maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=1430"&gt;Alignment of your brain maps: neuron sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to link them, we align those maps. The simplest example is the one
I gave before. If I hear something off to my right, like I click like
that, it could come from my fingers snapping or it could come from
something generated by somebody else or something else to my right, I
look to my right. If I hear it on the left, I look to my left. If I
hear it right in front of me, I keep looking right in front of me. And
if I hear it behind me, I turn around. And that's because our maps of
visual space and our maps of auditory space and our maps of motor
space are aligned to one another in perfect register. It's an
incredible feature of our nervous system. It takes place in a
structure called the superior colliculus, although you don't need to
know that name. Superior colliculus has layers, literally stacks of
neurons like in a sandwich where the zero point right in front of me,
or maybe 10 or 15 degrees off to my right or 10 or 15 degrees off to
my left, are aligned so that the auditory neurons, the ones that care
about sounds, at 15 degrees to my right, sit directly below the
neurons that look at 15 degrees to my right in my visual system. And
when I reach over to this direction, there's a signal that's sent down
through those layers that says 15 degrees off to the right is the
direction to look, it's the direction to listen, and it's the
direction to move if I need to move. So there's an alignment. And this
is really powerful. And this is what allows us to move through space
and function in our lives in a really fluid way. It's set up during
development. But there have been some important experiments that have
revealed that these maps are plastic, meaning they can shift, they're
subject to neuroplasticity. And there are specific rules that allow us
to shift them. So here's the key experiment. The key experiment was
done by a colleague of mine who's now retired but whose work is
absolutely fundamental in the field of neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen.
The Knudsen Lab, and many of the Knudsen Lab scientific offspring,
showed that if one is to wear prism glasses that shift the visual
field, that eventually there'll be a shift in the representation of
the auditory motor maps too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=1560"&gt;Wearing Prisms On Your Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what they initially did is they looked at young subjects, and
what they did is they moved the visual world by making them wear prism
glasses. So that, for instance, if my pen is out in front of me at
five degrees off center, so just a little bit off center, if you're
listening to this, this would be like just a little bit to my right,
but in these prism glasses, I actually see that pen way over far on my
right. So it's actually here, but I see it over there because I'm
wearing prisms on my eyes. What happens is in the first day or so, you
ask people or you ask animal subjects or whatever to reach for this
object, and they reach to the wrong place because they're seeing it
where it isn't. This gets especially complicated when you start
including sounds. When you have a thing off to your right making a
sound, but the thing is actually right here. So you're hearing the
sound at one location and you're seeing the object at another location
because you're wearing these prisms. So your image of the world is
totally distorted. Or, in experiments done by other groups, they wear
glasses, subjects wore glasses that completely invert the visual world
so that everything is upside down, which is an extreme example of
these representational maps being flipped or shifted. But what you
find is that in young individuals, within a day or two, they start
adjusting their motor behavior in exactly the right way so that they
always reach to the correct location. So they hear a sound at one
location, they see the object that ought to make that sound at a
different location, and they somehow are able to adjust their motor
behavior to reach to the correct location. It's incredible. It's
absolutely incredible. Or, in the case of the people who would look at
the world upside down, they somehow are able to navigate this upside
down world even though we're completely used to our feet being on the
floor and not on the ceiling and people not walking at us by hanging
off the ceiling like bats. Amazing. And what it tells us is that these
maps that are aligned to one another can move and shift and rotate,
and even flip themselves. And it happens best in young individuals. If
you do this in older individuals, in most cases, it takes a very long
time for the maps to shift, and in some cases they never shift. So
this is a very experimental scenario, but it's an important one to
understand because it really tamps down the fact that we have the
capacity to create dramatic shifts in our representation of the
outside world. So how can we get plasticity as adults that mimics the
plasticity that we get when we are juveniles? Well, the Knudsen Lab
and other labs have looked at this, and it's really interesting. First
of all, we have to ask, what is the signal for plasticity? Is it just
having prism glasses on? No, because they did that experiment and
ruled that out. Is it just the fact that the visual thing appears to
be far over to my right when in fact it's right in front of me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=1750"&gt;The KEY Trigger Plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The signal that generates the plasticity is the making of errors.
It's the reaches and failures that signal to the nervous system that
this is not working. And, therefore, the shifts start to take place.
And this is so fundamentally important because I think most people
think, "Oh, well, practice is going to be I have to access beginner's
mind," which is a great concept, actually, it's about approaching
things expecting to make errors, which is great. I think I am a
believer in beginner's mind. But people understandably get frustrated,
like they're trying to learn a piece on the piano and they can't do
it, or they're trying to write a piece of code, or they're trying to
access some sort of motor behavior, and they can't do it, and the
frustration drives them crazy, [indistinct] "I can't do it, I can't do
it," when they don't realize that [laughs] the errors themselves are
signaling to the brain and nervous system, "Something's not working."
And of course the brain doesn't understand the words something isn't
working. The brain doesn't even understand frustration as an emotional
state. The brain understands the neurochemicals that are released,
namely epinephrine and acetylcholine, but also, and we'll get into
this, the molecule dopamine when we start to approximate the correct
behavior just a little bit, and we start getting a little bit right.
So what happens is when we make errors, the nervous system kind of, I
don't want to say freaks out because it's a very mechanistic and
controlled situation, but the nervous system starts releasing
neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that say, "We better change
something in the circuitry." And so errors are the basis [laughs] for
neuroplasticity and for learning. And I wish that this was more
prominent out there. I guess this is why I'm saying it. And humans do
not like this feeling of frustration and making errors. The few that
do do exceedingly well in whatever pursuits they happen to be involved
in. The ones that don't, generally don't do well. They generally don't
learn much. And if you think about it, why would your nervous system
ever change? Why would it ever change? Unless there was something to
be afraid of, something that made us feel awful will signal that the
nervous system needs to change, or there's an error in our
performance. So it turns out that the feedback of these errors, the
reaching to the wrong location starts to release a number of things.
And now you've heard about them many times, but this would be
epinephrin. It increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus. And this is
why frustration that leads us to just kind of quit and walk away from
the endeavor is the absolute worst thing. Because if acetylcholine is
released, it creates an opportunity to focus on the error margin, the
distance between what it is that you're doing and what it is that you
would like to do. And then the nervous system starts to make changes
almost immediately in order to try and get the behavior right. And
when you start getting it even a little bit right, that third molecule
comes online or is released, which is dopamine, which allows for the
plastic changes to occur very fast. Now, this is what all happens very
naturally in young brains. But in old brains, it tends to be pretty
slow, except for in two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=1940"&gt;Frustration Is the Feeling to Follow (Further into Learning)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me just pause and just say this, if you are uncomfortable
making errors and you get frustrated easily, if you leverage that
frustration toward drilling deeper into the endeavor, you are setting
yourself up for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage. But
if you take that frustration and you walk away from the endeavor, you
are essentially setting up plasticity to rewire you according to what
happens afterwards, which is generally feeling pretty miserable. So
now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is that continuing to
drill into a process to the point of frustration but then staying with
that process for a little bit longer, and I'll define exactly what I
mean by a little bit, is the most important thing for adult learning
as well as childhood learning, but adult learning in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=1990"&gt;Incremental Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Knudsen Lab did two very important sets of experiments. The
first one was published in "Nature,' very important study, which
showed that juveniles can make these massive shifts in their map
representations, meaning you can shift the visual world using visual
prisms a huge amount and very quickly. Young individuals can shift
their representations of the world so that they learn to reach to the
correct location. They get a lot of plasticity all at once, and it
happens very fast in a period of just a couple days. In adults, it
tends to be very slow and most individuals never actually accomplish
the full map shift. They don't get the plasticity. Here we're talking
about map shifts, but this could be learning a new language, this
could be any number of different things that [indistinct] we're
attempting. So what we're saying is what I already said before, which
is that we learn very well as youngsters, but not as adults after 25.
But then what they did is they started making the increment of change
smaller. So instead of shifting the world a huge amount by putting
prisms that shifted that the visual world all the way over to the
right, they did this incrementally. So, first, they put on prisms that
shifted it just a little bit, just like seven degrees I believe was
the exact number. And then it was 14 degrees, and then it was 28
degrees. And so what they found was that the adult nervous system can
tolerate smaller and smaller errors over time, but that you can stack
those errors so that you can get a lot of plasticity. Put simply,
incremental learning as an adult is absolutely essential. You are not
going to get massive shifts in your representation to the outside
world. So how do you make small errors as opposed to big errors? Well,
the key is smaller bouts of focused learning for smaller bits of
information. It's a mistake to try and learn a lot of information in
one learning about as an adult. What these papers from the Knudsen Lab
show, and what others have gone on to show, is that the adult nervous
system is fully capable of engaging in a huge amount of plasticity,
but you need to do it in smaller increments per learning epoch or per
learning episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=2130"&gt;Huberman Free Throws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how would you do this? Well, say for instance, I'm terrible at free
throws, so let's say I wanted to learn free throws. I'm 45 years old,
so I'm well past the 25 and under mark. I'm going to make errors. I'm
going to make a lot errors. If I go into learning free throws knowing
that errors are the gate to plasticity, well, then I feel a little bit
better, but I still have to aim for the rim of the basket or the net.
Basically, showing how little I know about basketball. But I think I
know the general themes around basketball, involves a net, a back
board, and a ball, of course. So I go to the free throw line and I'll
throw. How long should I go? Well, until I'm hitting the point of
frustration. And at that point, continuing probably for anywhere from
10 to 100 more trials should be my limit, right? That should be my
limit if I want to improve some specific aspect of the motor behavior.
And so the question then is what should I be paying attention to? What
should I be focusing on? Well, obviously trying to get the ball into
the basket. But the beauty of motor learning is that the circuits for
auditory and visual and motor more or less teach themselves. I don't
necessarily have to be paying attention to exactly the contact of my
fingers with the ball or some random feature like whether or not I'm
bending my knees or not. The key is to try a number of different
parameters until I start to approximate the behavior that I want to
get a little bit better, and then trying to get consistent about that.
Now, many of you involved in sports learning will say, "Okay, well,
that's obvious, it's just incremental learning." But the key thing is
in those errors. By isolating the errors and making a number of errors
in a particular aspect of the motor movement, it signals to the brain
that it's plastic. And if I leave that episode of going and trying to
learn how to shoot free throws, my brain is still plastic. Plasticity
is a state of the brain and nervous system. It's not just geared
toward the specific thing I'm trying to learn. So there are two
aspects to plasticity that I think we really need to highlight. One is
that there's plasticity geared toward the thing that you are trying to
learn specifically. And then there are states of mind and body that
allow us to access plasticity. Now, toward the end of this episode,
I'm going to spell out specific protocols in a little more detail.
That free throw example might not correlate with what you want to
learn. Actually, I don't have a huge desire to learn free throws. I've
more or less given up on basketball, and free throws in particular.
But I think that it's important to understand that motor movements are
the most straightforward way to access states of plasticity. And that
can be for sake of learning the motor movement or for sake of
accessing plasticity more generally. One very important aspect to
getting plasticity as an adult is not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. So I gave an example of another 100 free throws or
something, but going out there and just getting 10,000 free throws all
at once or packing as much as I can into one episode is not going to
be as efficient for me as shorter bouts of intense learning as an
adult. Because the error signals are not as well-defined to my nervous
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=2330"&gt;Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not going to know what needs to change. And so this is really the
key element of incremental learning, is that you're trying to signal
to the nervous system at least one component that needs to change. The
nervous system needs to know what the error is. Now, when I shoot free
throws, Lord knows there are a lot of different kinds of errors that
happen, probably the way I'm bending my knees, the arc of the ball,
the way I'm organizing my shoulders, probably where my eyes are, lots
of things. So which ones to focus on? And that's what I said before,
the beauty of the motor system is I don't have to worry about all of
that. I just need to get the reps in a number of times, and the
nervous system will figure out how far off my motor commands are, at
the level of these maps that I described earlier, how far those
deviate from the desired behavior, getting the ball into the basket,
and it will start making adjustments. But as I make adjustments, or as
my nervous system makes adjustments for me, the key thing is to not
start adding a variety of new errors because then it gets confused.
And so this is why short learning bouts are absolutely essential. So
let's say it's for learning an instrument as an adult. Probably
anywhere from 7 minutes to 30 minutes, provided that you're fully
attending, you're very focused, is going to be a pretty significant
stimulus to inspire plasticity in the nervous system. Now, there is
one way to get a lot of plasticity all at once as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=2420"&gt;Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is that kind of Holy Grail thing of getting massive plasticity
as you would when you were a young person but as an adult. And the
Knudsen Lab revealed this by setting a very serious contingency on the
learning. What they did was they had a situation where subjects had to
find food that was displaced in their visual world, again, by putting
prisms, and they had to find the food, and the food made a noise,
there was a noise set to kind of the location of the food through an
array of speakers. Basically, what they found was that if people have
to adjust their visual world in order to get food, the plasticity
would eventually occur, but it was very slow as an adult. It was very,
very slow. Unless they actually had to hunt that food. In order to eat
at all, they needed plasticity. And then what happened was remarkable.
What they observed is that the plasticity as an adult can be as
dramatic, as robust as it is in a young person or in a young animal
subject, provided that there's a serious incentive for the plasticity
to occur. And this is absolutely important to understand, which is
that how badly we need or want the plasticity determines how fast that
plasticity will arrive, which is incredible because the brain is just
neurons and soup of chemicals. But this means that the importance of
something, how important something is to us, actually gates the rate
of plasticity and the magnitude of plasticity. And this is why just
passively going through most things, going through the motions, as we
say, or just getting our reps in quote, unquote, is not sufficient to
get the nervous system to change. This study, a beautiful study,
published in the journal of neuroscience shows that if we actually
have to accomplish something in order to eat or in order to get our
ration of income, we will reshape our nervous system very, very
quickly. So the nervous system has a capacity to change at a
tremendous rate, to an enormous degree at any stage of life provided
it's important enough that that happen. And I think some of you might
be saying, "Well, duh, that's obvious. If it's really crucial, then,
of course, it's going to change faster." But it didn't have to be that
way. And for most people who are trying to learn how to learn faster
or learn better, they probably, in most cases, they are hitting a
limit because the need to change is not crucial enough. And I think
there are a number of places where this has important relevance in the
people who are battling addiction, for instance. I will be the first
to say that I sympathize with the fact that addictions have a
biological component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=2605"&gt;Addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's clearly cases where people struggle tremendously to change
their behavior and their nervous system, in some cases, is so
disrupted by whatever substance they've been abusing or behavior that
they've been engaging in, that it's that much harder for them to
change. But we've also seen incredible examples where when people have
to change from an internal standpoint, from their own belief and
desire to change, that massive change is possible. And so I think that
the studies that Knudsen did showing the incremental learning can
create a huge degree of plasticity as an adult as well as when the
contingency is very high, meaning we need to eat, or we need to make
an income, or we need to do something that's vitally important for us,
that plasticity can happen in these enormous leaps just like they can
in adolescence and young adulthood. That points to the fact that it
has to be a neurochemical system. There has to be an underlying
mechanism. This wasn't a case of sticking a wire into the brain or
taking a particular drug. All the chemicals that we're about to talk
about are released from drugstores, if you will, [laughs] chemical
stores that already reside in all of our brains. And the key is how to
tap into those stores. And so we're going to next talk about what are
the specific behaviors that liberate particular categories of
chemicals that allow us to make the most of incremental learning and
that set the stage for plasticity that is similar enough or mimics
these high contingency states, like the need to get food, or really
create a sense of internal urgency, chemical urgency, if you will. If
you've heard previous episodes of this podcast, you may have heard me
talk about ultradian rhythm, which are these 90-minute rhythms that
break up our 24-hour day. They help break up our sleep into different
cycles of sleep like REM sleep and non-REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=2725"&gt;An Example of Ultradian-Incremental Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They break up our day in ways that allow us to learn best within
90-minute cycles, et cetera. So some of you might be saying, "Wait,
you've been talking about ultradian cycles, and a moment ago you were
talking about 7-minute or 12-minute or 30-minute learning cycles.
Today, we're really talking about how to tap into plasticity through
the completion of a task or working towards something repetitively and
making errors. And so just to frame this in the context of the
ultradian cycle, you might sit down, decide that you're going to learn
conversational French, which would mean that you probably don't
already speak French. So you're going to sit down, you're going to
decide you're going to learn some nouns and some verbs, you might do
some practice set. The ultradian cycle says that for the first 5 to 10
minutes of doing that, your mind is going to drift and your focus will
probably kick in, provided that you're restricting your visual world
to just the material in front of you, something we talked about last
episode, somewhere around the 10 or 15-minute mark. And then at best
you're probably going to get about an hour of a deliberate kind of
tunnel vision learning in there. Your mind will drift. And then toward
the end of that, what is now an hour and 10 or hour and 20 minute
cycle, your brain will sort of start to flicker in and out, you might
start thinking about what you need to eat or the fact that you have to
use the bathroom or something. And then by 90 minutes, it's probably
time to just stop the learning about and go do something else, maybe
return for a second learning about later, maybe take a nap afterwards
or something to enhance the learning. It's going to happen within
about a 90-minute block. You're going to go through that cycle of
learning. But when I refer to the 7 or 12 or 30 minutes of making
errors, what I mean is when you're really in a mode of repeating
errors, not deliberately, you're trying your best to accomplish
something, and you're failing. You're absolutely failing. You're
trying to remember say the sign language alphabet. I was trying to
teach myself this recently, and then I keep repeating and repeating,
and then get to a certain point where I kept making errors, making
errors, making errors. You want to keep making errors for this period
of time that I'm saying will last anywhere for about 7 to 30 minutes.
It is exceedingly frustrating, but that frustration, it liberates the
chemical cues that signal that plasticity needs to happen and they
also signal the particular neurons that are active. So in the case of
sign language, it might be the ones that control my hand movements as
well as me thinking about what the different letters are. It's
signaling different opponents within the networks between the brain
and body, and it's trying to figure out, "Wait, where are these errors
coming from? Where are the errors coming from? Ah, it's those neurons,
they're making the mistakes. They're making the mistakes, they're
making the mistakes." And it essentially highlights that pathway for
change. And it is the case that when we come back a day or two later
in a learning about after a nap or a night or two of deep rest, then
what we find is that we can remember certain things and the motor
pathways work. And we don't always get it perfectly, but we get a lot
of it right. Whereas, we got it wrong before. So that 7 to 30-minute
intense learning about is within the ultradian cycle, and I want to be
clear about that. And some people can tolerate many of these per day.
Most people can only tolerate one or two, maybe three. This is intense
work. If shooting free throws, you could probably do it all day. But
what I'm talking about is really trying to accelerate plasticity by
having a period of the 7 to 30 minutes per learning about that is
specifically about making errors. I want to really underscore that.
And it's not about, as I mentioned before, coming up with some little
hack or trick or something of that sort. It's really about trying to
cue the nervous system that something needs to change because
otherwise it simply won't change. Now, there's another aspect to
learning, I think it's only fair to mention, which is that we can all
learn very easily when there's something very bad happens to us. I
don't wish this on anyone, but it is the case that if something really
terrible happens that we will have a lifetime memory for that event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=2982"&gt;Bad Events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are processes that allow us to uncouple the emotional load of
that event. I talked about some of those a few episodes back, the
episode on dreams, trauma, and hallucinations. And we're going to
return to trauma release, PTSD, and some of those other themes in a
future episode. But the reason why negative experiences can be wired
into us so quickly is because our nervous system's main job is to keep
us safe, but at a deeper level, it's because negative experiences cue
us to the fact that whatever's happening that's really bad is very
different than the other things that tend to happen before. Most of
our experience doesn't remap us, but those negative experiences deploy
high levels of norepinephrine, high levels of acetylcholine, and
really make so that whatever it is that we experienced in that bad
episode is essentially queued up, and so we're on the lookout for it.
And this has a number of negative effects in terms of psychological
and emotional effects, but it is really a process designed to keep us
safe. The other ways in which we can learn more quickly besides just
making errors is when something really surprises us. And if we're
positively surprised by something or we are just flooded with this
molecule dopamine, then there's a great opportunity for plasticity.
Dopamine is a molecule that's almost always associated with pleasure
and with the accomplishment of a particular goal, but it's really also
a molecule of motivation. It's a molecule that is released inside of
us when we think we're on the right path. And it does have a capacity
to increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. It's released in
response to a number of natural behaviors, just that help with the
progression of ours and other species, things like food, sex, in some
sense social connection, although that's more serotonin, and serotonin
doesn't have the same effects on plasticity quite the same. And we'll
talk about a few later. But dopamine is when we think we're on the
right path toward an external goal,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3115"&gt;Surprise!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a little bit is released and it tends to give us more motivation
toward that goal. I think everyone could stand to enhance the rate of
learning by doing the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3120"&gt;Making Dopamine Work For You (Not The Other Way Around)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to attach dopamine, in a subjective way, to this process of
making errors. Because that's really combining two modes of plasticity
in ways that together can accelerate the plasticity. So, earlier, I
talked about making errors and having a focus about of learning that
includes making a lot of errors inside of that learning about. That is
going to be frustrating, but the frustration itself is the cue, and
epinephrine will be very high under those conditions. But if you can
just subjectively associate that experience with something good and
that you want to continue down that path as opposed to quitting when
you hit the point of frustration, well then you now start to create a
synergy between the dopamine that's released when we subjectively
think something is good, or tell ourselves something is good, and that
situation of making failures. In other words, making failing
repetitively, provided we're engaged in a very specific set of
behaviors when we do it, as well as telling ourselves that those
failures are good for learning and good for us, creates an outsize
effect on the rate of plasticity. It accelerates plasticity. Now, some
of you might be asking, and I get asked a lot, "Well, how do I get
dopamine to be released? And can I just tell myself that something is
good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3200"&gt;HOW to release dopamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when it's bad?" Well, actually yes, believe it or not. The thing about
dopamine is it's highly subjective. What's funny to one person is not
necessarily funny to the next. So it has to have some sense of
authenticity for you. But if you really want to be learning the thing
that you're trying to learn, that should be reason enough to tell
yourself, "Well, I'm frustrated, but the frustration is the source of
accelerated learning." Dopamine is one of these incredible molecules
that both can be released according to things that are hardwired in us
to release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth when we're
cold, cool environments when we're too warm. It's that kind of
pleasure molecule overall. But it's also highly subjective what
releases dopamine in one person versus the next. Everyone releases
dopamine in response to those very basic kind of behaviors and
activities, but dopamine is also released according to what we
subjectively believe is good for us. And that's what's so powerful
about it. In fact, a book that I highly recommend, if you want to read
more about dopamine, is a book that frankly I wish I had written, it's
such a wonderful book, it's called "The Molecule of More." And it
really talks about dopamine not just as a molecule associated with
reward, but a molecule associated with motivation and pursuit, and
just how subjectively controlled dopamine can be. So make lots of
errors, tell yourself that those errors are important and good for
your overall learning goals, so learn to attach dopamine, meaning
release dopamine in your brain when you start to make errors, keep the
bouts of learning relatively short if you're an adult. Younger people
can probably engage in more bouts of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3300"&gt;(Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's probably one of the reasons why they learn so much faster.
They can just pack so much more information into the brains and
nervous systems compared to adults. It's a little bit like, I'll use
the example of performance-enhancing drugs. Some of those drugs
probably do enhance performance at the level of increasing red blood
cell count, et cetera. But a lot of what those drugs do is they allow
athletes to recover faster so they can just train more. They allow
them to do more work. And so being a child is a little bit like being
in a performance enhanced brain milieu. Their brains are kind of on
natural, healthy neurochemicals that afford them a lot more learning
should they pursue it. So this goes back to my advice for young people
early on. If you're young, what should you do? Learn as much as you
can about as many things as you possibly can. And I suggest
specializing in something. I guess I'm not in a position to give
anyone direct advice, but I would say, hopefully, by about age 30,
hopefully younger,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3360"&gt;Timing Your Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you have some sense of what excites you and try and get really good at
that thing, provided it serves the world for better. But that's all
I'll say in terms of parenting advice. It's not my place. But maybe
sometime I'll have an episode completely devoted to sort of youth and
learning in youth. But once you're attaching dopamine to this process
of making errors, then I start getting lots of questions that really
are the right questions, which are, how often should I do this? And
when should I be doing this and at what time? Well, I've talked a
little bit about this in previous episodes, but as long as we're now
kind of into the nitty-gritty of tools and application, each of us
have some natural times throughout the day when we are going to be
much better at tolerating these errors and much more focused on what
it is that we're trying to do. Last episode was about focus, but
chances are that you can't focus as well at 4:00 pm as you can at
10:00 am. It differs for everybody depending on when you're sleeping
and your kind of natural chemistry and rhythms. But find the time or
times of day when you naturally have the highest mental acuity, and
that's really when you want to engage in these learning bouts. And
then get to the point where you're making errors and then keep making
errors for 7 to 30 minutes. Just keep making those errors and drill
through it. And you're almost seeking frustration. And if you can find
some pleasure in the frustration, yes, that is a state that exists,
you have created the optimal neurochemical milieu for learning that
thing. But then here's the beauty of it, you also have created the
optimal milieu for learning other things afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3456"&gt;(Chem)Trails of Neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you leave that about of, I gave the example of free throws, or
maybe it's playing tennis, or maybe it's some other skill, and you sit
down to read a book, your brain is in a heightened state to learn and
retain the information. Because those chemicals don't get released and
then shut down. You're creating a whole milieu, an environment of
these chemicals. And the tale of how long these chemicals stay
sloshing around in your brain has too many factors for me to put a
hard number on it. It's going to depend on transporters and enzymes
and all sorts of things. But at least for an hour or so I would say,
you're going to be in a state of heightened learning, and the ability
to learn, not just the motor patterns but cognitive information,
language information, maybe you go to therapy right after that and you
work on something in a very deliberate way that you're trying to work
on, maybe you don't go to therapy, maybe you do something else that's
important to you. Again, there are just a variety of examples I could
give. There are a number of things that allow us to powerfully access
these states of error that are kind of surprising but also kind of
fun. Again, these aren't gimmicks, these tap into these basic
mechanisms of plasticity. And the three that I'd like to talk about
next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3537"&gt;The Three Key Levers To Accelerate Plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are balance, meaning the vestibular system, as well as the two sides
of what I call limbic friction or autonomic arousal. And if none of
that makes sense, I'm going to put a fine point on each one of those
and what it is and why it works for opening up neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3555"&gt;Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm and Focused&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about limbic friction. Now, limbic friction is not a term
you're going to find in the textbooks. So if any of my colleagues are
listening, I want to repeat limbic friction, I realize is not
something you're going to find in any of the textbooks. But it is an
important principle that captures a lot of information that is in
textbooks, both neurobiology and psychology, and it has some really
important implications. Limbic friction is my attempt to give a name
to something that is more nuanced and mechanistic than stress.
Because, typically, when we hear about stress, we think of heart rate,
heartbeat going too fast, breathing too fast, sweating, and not being
in a state that we want, we're to alert and we want to be more calm.
And, indeed, that's one condition in which we have limbic friction,
meaning our limbic system is taking control of a number of different
aspects of our autonomic or automatic biology. And we are struggling
to control that through what we call top-down mechanisms. We're trying
to calm down in order to reduce that level of arousal. We're all
familiar with this, it's called the stress response. However, there's
another aspect of stress that's just as important, which is when we're
tired and we're fatigued and we need to engage, we need to be more
alert than we are. And so what I call limbic friction is really
designed to describe the fact that when our autonomic nervous system
isn't where we want it, meaning we're trying to be more alert or we're
trying to be less alert, both of those feel stressful to people. The
other way to put it is that the word stress is not a very good word to
describe what most people experience as stressful because it can
either be being too tired or being too alert. Now, why am I bringing
this up in a discussion about neuroplasticity? This is not a
discussion about stress. At some point, we will talk about stress and
tools to deal with stress. But the reason I'm bringing this up is that
in order to access neuroplasticity, you need these components of
focus, you need the component of attaching subjective reward, you need
to make errors, all this stuff. And a lot of people find it difficult
to just get into the overall state to access those things. So now
there's a series of gates that people are having a hard time
accessing. They're too tired and they can't focus, for instance. Well,
here's the beauty of it. If you are too alert, meaning you're too
anxious, and you want to calm down in order to learn better, there are
things that you can do. The two that I've spoken about previously on
various podcasts, and I'll just review them really quickly, are the
double inhale exhale. So inhaling twice through the nose and exhaling
once through the mouth. This is not some yoga trick or some hack. This
is what's called a physiological sigh. It offloads carbon dioxide from
the lungs, it has a number of different effects. These were described
in textbooks dating back to the 30s and a number of laboratories have
explored the neurocircuitry underlying these so-called physiological
sighs. That will calm you down faster than anything else that I'm
aware of. The other thing is starting to remove your tunnel vision.
When you use tunnel vision, you're very focused, that epinephrine up
is released by dilating your field of gaze, so-called panoramic
vision. Great, so now you can start to sort of move up and down this
level of autonomic arousal. The key is you want to be in a state of
arousal that's ideally matched to the thing that you're trying to
perform or learn. So if I'm really anxious and I can't even pick up
the basketball or I feel like I'm shaking or my muscles are too tight,
I don't have that kind of looseness, when I move like that, it almost
makes it look like I could throw a free throw, but I miss 95% of the
time, unless the basket is very, very low and I place it in directly.
I guess that's not a free throw, is it? [laughs] In any case, the
point being that you want to be in a state of alertness but calm. And
so you need to have ways to calm yourself down when you're too amped
up. But the other side of limbic friction is important too. If you are
too tired and you can't focus, well, then it's going to be impossible
to even get to the starting line, so to speak, for engaging in
neuroplasticity through incremental learning, et cetera. So in that
case, there are other methods that you can do to wake yourself up. The
best thing you should do is get a good night's sleep, but that's not
always possible, or use a NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocol. But if
you've already done those things or you're simply exhausted for
whatever other reason, then there are other things that I often get
asked about, like sure a cup of coffee or super oxygenation breathing,
which means inhaling more than exhaling on average in a breathing
about. Now we're sort of getting toward the realm of like how you
could trick your nervous system into waking up. And if you bring more
oxygen in by making your inhales deeper and longer, you will become
more alert. You'll start to actually deploy norepinephrine if you
breathe very fast. So there are things that you can do to move up or
down this so-called autonomic arousal arc. And what you want to ask
before you undergo any learning about is how much limbic friction am I
experiencing? Am I too alert and I want to be calmer, or am I too calm
and too sleepy and I want to be more alert?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3865"&gt;The First Question To Ask Yourself Before Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're going to need to engage in behaviors that bring you to the
starting line in order to learn. There are other things that you can
do in order to then learn better and faster besides incremental
learning, and those center on the vestibular system. And this may come
as a surprise to some people, but probably not as a surprise to some
of you whose professions or whose recreation involves a lot of motor
activity and sort of what we call high dimensional skill activity, not
just running or cycling or very linear activities like weightlifting,
but things that involve inversions and a lot of lateral movement,
actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling, these kinds of things,
gymnastics type stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=3900"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the vestibular system to access neuroplasticity? Well, we have a
hardwired system for balance, and here's how it works in as simple
terms as I can possibly come up with. As we move through space, or
even if we're stationary, there are really three main planes of
movement. Now, I realize some people are just listening to this, so
I'm going to do this for both the folks that are just listening and
for those of you that are watching on video. So there are three main
modes of movement. And it turns out that your brain doesn't really
know where your body is, except through that proprioceptive feedback.
The main way it knows is through three planes of movement that we call
pitch, which is like nodding. So if I nod like this, that's pitch.
Then there's yaw, which is side to side, which is like shaking my head
no. And then there's roll from side to side like when a puppy looks at
you, like mm-mmm, that kind of thing. So pitch, yaw, and roll. And the
pilots out there will know exactly what I'm talking about. The brain
knows the orientation and position of your body relative to gravity,
depending on whether or not your brain in your head actually is
engaging more in pitch, yaw, or roll, or some combination because if I
lean down like so or like so, it's a combination of pitch, yaw, and
roll. You might say like, "What is going on here?" Well, we have these
little things in our inner ear called the semicircular canals. Just
like our eyes have two main functions, one is to see objects in space
and the other is to set our circadian clocks through subconscious
mechanisms, our ears have two main roles. One is to hear, to perceive
sound waves or take in sound waves for perception, so-called hearing,
and the other is balance or vestibular function. So sitting in our
ears are these semicircular canals, and they're these little tubes
where these little stones, they're actually little bits of calcium,
roll back and forth like little marbles. When we roll this way, they
roll this way, when we pitch. When we go from side to side, there's
some that sit flat like this and they go [makes swishing sound] like
marbles inside of a hula hoop. And then we have roll, there's some
that are kind of at 45 degrees to those and it's kind of pitchy on
roll. Okay, great. That sends signals to the rest of our brain and
body that tell us how to compensate for shifts relative to gravity.
And you say, "Okay, I thought we were talking about plasticity." But
this is where it gets really, really cool. Errors in vestibular motor
sensory experience, meaning when we are off-balance and we have to
compensate by looking at, thinking about, or responding to the world
differently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=4065"&gt;Cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cause an area of our brain called the cerebellum, it actually means
mini brain, it looks like a little mini brain like tucked below our
cortex in the back, cause the cerebellum to signal some of these
deeper brain centers that release dopamine, norepinephrine, and
acetylcholine. And that's because these circuits in the inner ear, et
cetera, and the cerebellum, they were designed to recalibrate our
motor movements when our relationship to gravity changes. Something
fundamental to survival. We can't afford to be falling down all the
time or missing things that we grab for, or running in the wrong
direction when something is pursuing us. These are hardwired circuits
that tap right into these chemical pathways. And those chemical
pathways are the gates to plasticity. So I really want to spell this
out clearly 'cause I've given a lot of information today. The first
thing is, how are you arriving to the learning about? You need to make
sure your level of autonomic arousal is correct. The ideal state is
going to be clear, calm, and focused, maybe a little bit more on the
arousal level, like heightened arousal. So understand limbic friction,
understand that you can be too tired, in which case you're going to
need to get yourself more alert, or you can be too alert and you're
going to need to get yourself calmer. That gets you to the starting
line. When you're at the starting line, then you're going to go into a
learning about, and that's when you want to start making these errors.
But what I'm saying is there's a layer in between where if you are
interested in using motor patterns as a way to open up plasticity for
all kinds of learning, not just motor learning, disrupting your
vestibular motor relationship, and I'll tell you how to do that in a
moment, can deploy or release neurochemicals in the brain that place
you into a state that makes you much better at learning and makes
making errors much more pleasureful, you're much more willing to do
that. Now, some of you are probably saying, "Flow state, flow state."
Okay, I have friends that work on flow states and who are involved in
flow states and trying to figure out what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=4200"&gt;Flow States Are Not The Path To Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have great respect for those people. I want to tip my hat to them.
Very important work. But, again, flow is an expression of what you
already know how to do. It's not how you learn, it's how you express
what you've already learned. I want to be really clear about that.
It's been kind of presented as this super state or highly desirable
state that we can all reach for. That's the wrong [indistinct] to
reach for until you already know how to do the things that I'm
describing, in my opinion. So the vestibular system, if you can engage
the vestibular system and create some errors within the vestibular
motor operations that you're carrying out, you create a neurochemical
state that then makes you very, very good at learning very quickly
regardless of age. So what would this look like? Does this mean just
doing inversions? Does this mean doing yoga? Maybe. Does this mean
taking corners faster on your road bike? Let's say you always swim
freestyle or breaststroke, does this mean swimming backstroke or
butterfly? It depends. It depends, however, on a very, very easy to
understand parameter, which is how regularly you perform a particular
motor behavior and how novel a behavior is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=4278"&gt;Novelty and Instability Are Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the more novel that a behavior is in terms of your relationship to
gravity, the more it will open up the opportunity for plasticity. Have
you ever seen somebody who just jumped out of a plane for the first
time with a parachute? [laughs] I don't even want to think about what,
if you've just seen somebody who jumped out of a plane for the first
time without a parachute, I just hope the plane was on the ground. But
if you seen somebody after that, they are in this incredible state
because their body and brain are flooded with all these neurochemicals
because it's very novel to them. However, I've got friends from
communities that have done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens of
thousands of jumps, and they're always alert and aware, but it becomes
pretty regular for them. That's the point. And they're not in this
kind of buzzed out, excited state afterwards because it's routine for
them. The key is to bring novelty to the vestibular motor experience,
the vestibular motor commands that you're performing. How do you do
that? Well, it's all about your orientation relative to gravity. Now,
I wouldn't want anyone to place themselves at risk. So if you can't do
handstands, don't try and do them, freestanding and whatever. If
you're good at handstands, guess how much plasticity doing handstands
for half an hour is going to create for you. Zero. Zero. Your body is
fully comfortable walking on your hands. I see these people walking on
your hands, being upside down, being inverted. Your Cirque du Soleil
performers, they're very comfortable there, and there is zero
learning, zero plasticity because the failures and errors and the
relationship to gravity are very typical for that individual. Now,
what this means is that if we're going to use motor practices to open
up plasticity for learning, not just those practices, but maybe some
cognitive skills or other things in the period that follows, we need
to create a sense of novelty relative to gravity. And that means being
either in a new position or slightly unstable. Believe it or not, I
don't want anyone injuring themselves, but the sensation of falling or
close to falling signals the cerebellum to signal the deep brain
centers that release these neurochemicals that something is very
different and we need to correct this error very, very fast. Now,
earlier, I was talking about high contingencies for learning, and you
definitely don't want to make it a kind of like either survive this or
die kind of experience. I confess, I occasionally look at these
parkour videos on YouTube. Believe it or not, a lot of those people
have died, the ones that do these ridiculous things of hanging off of
buildings and things. I am not suggesting you do that. Please don't do
that. What I'm talking about is finding safe ways to explore the
sensory motor vestibular space, as we call it, the relationship
between those things. So that could be through yoga. If you're
terrible at yoga, there's more opportunity for you to learn than
somebody who's very skilled at yoga, for instance, or gymnastics, or
handstands, or on your road bike. This is, unfortunately, what, I
don't want to name brands, but stationary bikes where they give you
the visual experience of moving through space, but you're not actually
moving through physical space, there's no vestibular feedback. It's
all visual. You're stationary on the bike. So unless you're hanging
off the bike in your living room like almost to the point you're
tipping the bike, you're not getting the actual vestibular motor
sensory mismatch. That mismatch is the signal that deploys dopamine,
epinephrin, and these other things. I don't care how excited or how
much fun the ride was or how much music you're playing that you love,
it's not the same situation as being out of your normal relationship
to the gravitational pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=4495"&gt;How to Arrive At Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level of
autonomic arousal. Clear and focused is best, but don't obsess over
being right there, it's okay. If you're a little anxious or a little
bit tired, then you want to make errors. We talked about that, and
this vestibular motor sensory relationship is absolutely key if you
want to get heightened or accelerated plasticity. And we talked about
another feature, which is setting a contingency. If there's a reason,
an important reason for you to actually learn, even if you're making
failures, the learning will be accelerated. So there's really four
things that you really need to do for plasticity as an adult. And I
would say that these also apply to young people. And there's an
interesting kind of a thought experiment there as well, which is if
you look at children, they are moving a lot in different dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=4545"&gt;The Other Reason Kids Learn Faster Than Adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are sometimes hanging from trees. My sports were always things
where I tended to get hurt a lot, fall a lot. So it's skateboarding
for me when I was younger, so a lot of falling and rolling and various
things of that sort. But whatever sport the kids are playing, or even
if they don't play a sport, they tend to move in a lot of different
relationships to gravity, more dimensionality to their movements I
should say, than adults. And one of the questions that's always kind
of been in the back of my mind is, as we age we get less good at
engaging in neuroplasticity. Part of that is because as the brain ages
there are certain changes to the way that neurons are structured,
their molecular components, et cetera. But it's kind of a self-
amplifying, or I should say self-degenerating cycle where as we get
older, we tend to get more linear and more regular about specific
kinds of movements. So we'd get on the treadmill, or we take the walk,
or we just always go up the same stairs, et cetera. And there's less
opportunity, typically, for engaging these relationships to the
gravitational pull through the vestibular motor sensory convergence
that we talked about a moment ago. And so you sort of have to wonder
whether or not the lack of plasticity or the reduced plasticity in
older individuals, which includes me, would reflect the fact that
those chemicals aren't being deployed because we're not engaging in
certain behaviors as opposed to we can't engage in the behaviors
because the chemicals aren't being deployed. Now, I have a feeling
it's both. These have a reciprocal relationship. And I certainly,
again, I don't think it would be wise for anyone who doesn't have the
muscle stabilizing skills or the bone density, et cetera, to start
doing inversions and things of that sort. That's not what I'm talking
about here. But it's interesting to think about the sorts of exercise
that we engage in. We all know that getting the heart rate elevated
three to five times a week is really good for us for cardiovascular
health. I think there's a ton of data to support that now. Some load-
bearing exercise is important for increasing bone density and
maintaining muscular strength and proprioceptive feedback. Because,
I'm sure many of you know this, but resistance exercise actually
trains the nerve to muscle connections as much as it does the muscles
themselves. Something I talked about at the beginning of the episode.
But I think most of us could stand to increase the degree to which we
engage this vestibular system in novel ways. And that can be done
quite safely through a number of different mechanisms. I'm not a
surfer, but people who do that sort of thing are very familiar with
orienting their body differently according to the gravitational pull.
They're lying down, then they're standing up, then they're turning,
they're leaning their head. So, again, it's this pitch, yaw, roll
thing. And, again, if you're very skilled at surfing, you're actually
not going to open up plasticity just by surfing. It's in the learning
of these new relationships to gravity that the windows for plasticity
are enhanced. I want to make sure that I underscore the fact that this
vestibular thing that I've been describing is a way to really
accentuate plasticity. It's tapping into an inborn biological
mechanism where the cerebellum has outputs to these deep brain nuclei
associated with dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine. You don't
want to endanger yourself in the course of pursuing these activities,
but it is a powerful mechanism. That's kind of an amplifier on
plasticity, as is high contingency. If you really need to learn
conversational French&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=4765"&gt;Learning French and Other Things Faster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to save your relationship, the chances are you're going to learn it.
There are limits, of course, to the extent to which one can accentuate
or accelerate plasticity. The ceiling on this is not infinite,
although we don't know how high it goes. I think it's reasonable to
say that if someone put a gun to my head and said, "Learn
conversational French in the next 120 seconds," that conversational
French will be limited probably to just one word, probably the word
oui or something like that. Because I can't stuff in all the knowledge
all at once. I think that's the dream of brain-machine interface, that
one will be able to download a chip into their hippocampus or cortex,
or some other brain structure that would allow them to download
conversational French. And someday we may get to that, that capability
may come about. Right now, it does not exist, nor is there a specific
pill or chemical that will allow you to download more information more
quickly. This is the issue around nootropics I've talked about before.
There are things that can increase focus, mainly things that increase
acetylcholine and transmission through the nicotine system, things
that can increase dopamine, things like L-tyrosine. Again, I'm not
recommending these. You need to heed the warnings on those bottles,
but they will increase these neurochemicals. And there are, of course,
things that will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, or some
people, because of prescription, take Adderall. I'm, again, not
suggesting people take any of these things. In fact, today I focused
almost exclusively on behavioral tools and ways of structuring
learning bouts that will allow you to access more plasticity
regardless of age. And they center around things that I'm sure if you
look around you you'll see evidence for, "Oh, incremental learning is
powerful," or, "Oh, the vestibular system can open up opportunities
for plasticity." I'm sure that the yogis out there all saying, "Wait,
this sounds exactly like yoga. We're supposed to push to an edge and
do these inversions and do all those sorts of things." Well, I want to
be clear, I never said anyone should do inversions. I said that the
vestibular system is a valuable portal into some of these
neurochemical states that favor plasticity. But not so seldom, I hear
from the yoga community, and they will say things like, "Much of what
you're saying about how the brain works or neuroplasticity has already
been described or is embedded in yoga practices." And I just want to
be very clear, I have tremendous respect for the yoga community and
the practices, I've done yoga from time to time, I find it challenging
and valuable. I'm not a regular practitioner. But the problem with
yoga is exactly the same problem with science,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=4920"&gt;Yoga versus Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is that yoga has a lot of practices for which there are very
specific names, but no description or lending of understanding about
mechanism. And science has a lot of mechanisms [laughs] and a lot of
publications and papers for which there's very little, if not no
description of tools and practices. My goal in not just today but in
many ways throughout the course of the podcast is to bridge the gaps
between these various disciplines in ways that are grounded mainly to
the fields of neuroscience and some related fields. So, yes, it's true
that I look at things mainly through the lens of science, but that's
not to say that it exhaustively explains everything about anything,
nor is it to say that it's the only lens through which one could look
at something like neuroplasticity. So I just want to acknowledge that
I have great respect for all these different practices and
communities. And I think that, indeed, there are many cases in which
different communities and practices have been aimed at targeting the
same goals or outcomes. Science and neuroscience, through an
understanding of mechanism, can allow all of us to gain kind of common
understanding about what those practices are and how to access things
like neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. And I do believe. as I've said
previously on this podcast, that understanding mechanism affords us a
certain flexibility. And I don't mean physical flexibility. I mean a
flexibility when we can't engage in a particular behavior, maybe we
were injured or maybe we're not in the right situation to do a
particular practice, but by thinking about mechanism, we can adapt our
circumstances. I talked about this with sleep. If you're rigidly
attached to one protocol of always looking at sunlight at one
particular time in the morning and in the evening, that is not as
valuable as understanding the mechanisms of why you might look at
sunlight at one particular time versus another because that affords
you a flexibility, allows you to adapt. And life is very dynamic and
we don't have control over all the external conditions all the time.
And so understanding mechanism through the lens of neuroscience, I do
believe, can be very powerful because, of course, there are multiple
ways to access dopamine, there are multiple ways to adjust limbic
friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx3U64IXFOY&amp;amp;t=5055"&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just through respiration. Of course, there are many ways to
do that. And so my overall goal here in this episode and with this
podcast is to give you some understanding of the mechanisms and the
insights into the underlying biology that allow you to tailor what
these kind of foundational mechanisms are to suit your particular
learning needs. So I really thank you for your time and attention
today. I've covered a lot of material. I very much encourage questions
in the comments section if you're looking at this on YouTube. And if
you're not and you're listening to it, on Apple or Spotify. Please
feel free to visit us over on the YouTube channel and put your
questions in the comments section. I do read them. This entire month
is all about neuroplasticity. There's a lot to cover, but I'm very
excited to delve deeper into this topic as it relates to your
particular interests. Many of you have graciously asked how you can
help support the podcast. The best way you can do that is to subscribe
to the YouTube channel, if you haven't done that already, as well as
to place questions in the comments section below, or comments if you'd
like to give us feedback. Also to subscribe on Apple and/or Spotify.
And Apple allows you to leave a five-star review, if you believe we
deserve a five-star review, as well as leave comments about the
podcast. In addition, if you can suggest the podcast to your friends,
to your family members, or anyone that you think might be able to use
and appreciate the information, that's a terrific way to support us.
And, of course, check out our sponsors that we mentioned at the
beginning. That's a terrific way to support us as well. Several times
throughout today's episode, as well as on previous episodes of the
podcast, I've talked about various supplements that can be useful for
enhancing sleep, enhancing neuroplasticity, et cetera. And, again, I
want to emphasize that I always think that behavioral practices are
the place to start. I don't think supplements should ever be the first
line of entry for people looking to enhance these aspects of their
nervous system and life. But for those of you that are interested in
supplements and the supplements that I take, I'm pleased to announce
that we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E. And Thorne makes
supplements that are, in my opinion, of the very highest stringency in
terms of what's listed on the bottle is actually what you'll find in
the bottle, this is a serious issue for the supplement industry, as
well as just the overall quality of the materials they put into their
supplements. If you'd like to take a look at the supplements that I
take as well as explore any of them for yourself, you can go to
thorne.com/u/huberman. And if you look there, you'll see a number of
the different supplements that I take. And if you decide to purchase
any of them, you'll get 20% off your order. So that's Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman to see the supplements that I take and to
explore if any of them are right for you. In the next episode of this
podcast, we're going to continue to explore neuroplasticity. This, as
you may recall, is the way that we go about things here the Huberman
Lab Podcast, which is to really drill deeply into a topic for three or
four, or even five episodes so that by the end of those episodes, all
of you have a very firm understanding of how to apply the principles
of neurobiology to the specific practices and endeavors that are most
important to you. So I very much thank you for your time and
attention. I know it's a lot of information and it takes a bit of
focus and attention, and certainly will trigger plasticity to learn
all this information. I want to encourage you and just remind you that
you don't have to grasp it all at once, that it is here archived and
that if you want to return to the information, it will still be here.
And that I, most of all, really appreciate your interest in science.
Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] My name is
Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
at Stanford school of medicine. This podcast is separate from my
teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my
desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about
science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping
with that theme. I want to thank the first sponsor of today's podcast.
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized
nutrition platform that analyzes blood factors and DNA related factors
that helps you develop a personalized health plan. Many important
factors related to our health and wellbeing can only be measured by a
blood sample and by a DNA sample. I've been getting my blood work done
for many years now. And I use InsideTracker because InsideTracker
makes it very easy to not only get the blood work done, someone can
come to your house or you can go to a clinic for instance but also to
interpret the data that you get. Oftentimes when we get blood work
done there are all these numbers and all these levels of different
hormones and metabolic factors and so forth. But one doesn't know what
to do with that information InsideTracker has a terrific dashboard
platform where you go online and it makes analyzing all that easy. And

is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that
makes meditating easy. I've been meditating on and off for about three
decades now. And typically it's been more off than on. I think like a
lot of people I find it hard to stick with a meditation practice. A
few years ago, I started using the Headspace app. And when I did that,
I found that I was meditating really consistently. First of all, the
meditations in Headspace are backed by quality scientific peer
reviewed studies. Second of all the meditations allow the meditation
to be kind of easy and fun to access. I started first using them when
I would travel because on JetBlue flights, which was the airline I was
using the meditations are offered as an alternative to watching a TV
or a movie. And I found that I would arrive feeling much more
refreshed than had I just sort of zoned out on the TV the whole time,
or even if I had slept. And I'll continue to use Headspace regularly
pretty much every day for a short meditation. And I personally derive
tremendous benefits from it. If you'd like to try Headspace you can go
to headspace.com/specialoffer and they'll give you one month of all
the meditations that they have available completely free. That's the
best offer available right now from Headspace. So you can go to
headspace.com/specialoffer and you'll get one month completely free
all the meditations they have. The third sponsor of today's podcast is

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=230"&gt;Plasticity: What Is it, &amp;amp; What Is It For?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we're talking about neuroplasticity which is this incredible
feature of our nervous systems that allows it to change in response to
experience. neuroplasticity is arguably one of the most important
aspects of our biology. It holds the promise for each and all of us to
think differently, to learn new things, to forget painful experiences
and to essentially adapt to anything that life brings us by becoming
better. Neuroplasticity has a long and important history and we're not
going to review all of it in detail. But today what we are going to do
is discuss what is neuroplasticity? As well as the different forms of
neuroplasticity. We're going to talk about how to access
neuroplasticity depending on how old you are and depending on the
specific types of changes that you're trying to create. This is a
topic for which there are lots of tools, as well as lots of biological
principles that we can discuss. So let's get started. Most people are
familiar with the word neuroplasticity. It's sometimes also called
neural plasticity. Those are the same thing. So, if I say
neuroplasticity or neural plasticity, I'm referring to the same
process, which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change
itself. There are a lot of reasons why the nervous system would do
this. It could do it in response to some traumatic event. It could,
for instance, create a sense of fear around a particular place or a
fear of automobiles or planes. It could also occur when something
positive happens, like the birth of our first child or when our puppy
does something amusing or we see an incredible feat of performance in
athleticism. The word neuroplasticity means so many things to so many
different people that I thought it would be important to just first
put a little bit of organizational logic around what it is and how it
happens, because nowadays if you were to go online and Google the word
neuroplasticity, you would find hundreds of thousands of references,
scientific references as well as a lot of falsehoods about what
neuroplasticity is and how to access it. As I mentioned before, we're
going to talk about the science of it and we're going to talk about
the tools that allow you to engage this incredible feature of your
nervous system. And that's the first point, which is that all of us
were born with a nervous system that isn't just capable of change, but
was designed to change. When we enter the world, our nervous system is
primed for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=390"&gt;Babies and Potato Bugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain and nervous system of a baby is wired very crudely. The
connections are not precise. And we can see evidence of that in the
fact that babies are kind of flopping, they're like a little potato
bug with limbs. They can't really do much in terms of coordinated
movement. They certainly can't speak and they can't really do anything
with precision. And that's because we come into this world
overconnected. We have essentially wires, those wires have names like
axons and dendrites. Those are the different parts of the neurons
discussed in episode one, but those little parts and those wires and
connections are everywhere. Imagine a bunch of roads that are all
connected to one another in kind of a mess, but there are no highways.
They're all just small roads. That's essentially what the young
nervous system is like. And then as we mature, as we go from day one
of life to 10 years old, 20 years old, 30 years old, what happens is
particular connections get reinforced and stronger and other
connections are lost. So that's the first important principle that I
want everyone to understand, which is that developmental plasticity,
the neuroplasticity that occurs from the time we're born until about
age 25 is mainly a process of removing connections that don't serve
our goals well. Now, of course, certain events happen during that
birth to 25 period in which positive events and negative events are
really stamped down into our nervous system in a very dramatic
fashion, by what we call one-trial learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=480"&gt;Customizing Your Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We experience something once and then our nervous system is forever
changed by that experience. Unless of course, we go through some work
to undo that experience. So, I want you to imagine in your mind that
when you were brought into this world, you were essentially a widely
connected web of connections that was really poor at doing any one
thing. And that through your experience, what you were exposed to by
your parents or rather caretakers, through your social interactions,
through your thoughts, through the languages that you learn, through
the places you traveled or didn't travel, your nervous system became
customized to your unique experience. Now, that's true for certain
parts of your brain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=530"&gt;Hard-Wired Versus Plastic Brains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that are involved in what we call representations of the outside
world. A lot of your brain is designed to represent the visual world
or represent the auditory world or represent the gallery of smells
that are possible in the world. However, there are aspects of your
nervous system that were designed not to be plastic. They were wired
so that plasticity or changes in those circuits is very unlikely.
Those circuits include things like, the ones that control your
heartbeat, the ones that control your breathing, the ones that control
your digestion, And thank goodness that those circuits were set up
that way because you want those circuits to be extremely reliable. You
never want to have to think about whether or not your heart will beat
or whether or not you will continue breathing or whether or not you'll
be able to digest your food. So many nervous system features like
digestion and breathing and heart rate are hard to change. Other
aspects of our nervous system are actually quite easy to change. And
one of the great gifts of childhood, adolescence and young adulthood,
is that we can learn through almost passive experience. We don't have
to focus that hard in order to learn new things. In fact, children go
from being able to speak no language whatsoever to being able to speak
many many words and comprise sentences including words they've never
heard before which is remarkable. It means that the portions of the
brain involved in speech and language are actually primed to learn and
create new combinations. What this tells us is that the young brain is
a plasticity machine. But then right about age 25 plus or minus a year
or two, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=625"&gt;Everything Changes At 25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After age 25 or so, in order to get changes in our nervous system, we
have to engage in a completely different set of processes in order to
get those changes to occur and for them more importantly to stick
around. And this is something that I think is vastly overlooked in the
popular culture discussion about neuroplasticity. People always talk
about fire together, wire together. Fire together wire together is
true. It is the statement of my colleague at Stanford, Carla Shatz and
it's an absolute truth about the way that the nervous system wires up
early in development. But, fire together wire together doesn't apply
in the same way after age 25. And so we have these little memes and
these little quotes that, you know circulate on the internet like fire
together, wire together or there's a famous quote from the greatest
neurobiologist of all time, Ramón y Cajal. I think it goes something
like, you know should somebody wish to change their nervous system
they could be the sculptor of their nervous system in any way they
want, something like that. And that sounds great. I mean, who wouldn't
want to change their nervous system any way they want, but what's lost
in those statements is how to actually accomplish that. And we're
going to cover that today but please understand that early in
development your nervous system is connected very broadly in ways that
make it very hard to do anything well. From birth until about age 25
those connections get refined mainly through the removal of
connections that don't serve us and the incredible strengthening of
connections that relate to either powerful experiences or that allow
us to do things like walk and talk and do math, et cetera. And then
after age 25, if we want to change those connections, those super
highways of connectivity, we have to engage in some very specific
processes. And those processes, as we'll soon learn are gated. Meaning
you can't just decide to change your brain. You actually have to go
through a series of steps to change your internal state in ways that
will allow you to change your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=749"&gt;Costello and Your Hearing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to acknowledge that Costello is snoring particularly loud
today. Some of you seem very keen at picking up on his snoring, others
of you can't hear his snoring. It's very low rumbling sound and
whether or not you can or you can't probably relates to the
sensitivity of your hearing. We're actually going to talk about
perfect pitch today and range of auditory detection. And so if you can
hear Costello's snoring enjoy, if you can't, enjoy. I want to talk
about how the nervous system changes. What are these changes? Many of
us have been captivated by the stories in the popular press about the
addition of new neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=790"&gt;The New Neuron Myth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea, oh, if you go running or you exercise, your brain actually
makes new neurons. Well, I'm going to give you the bad news first
which is that, after puberty, so after about age 14 or 15, the human
brain and nervous system adds very few if any new neurons. The idea
that new neurons could be added to the brain is one that has a rich
history in experimental science. It's clear that in rodents and in
some non-human primates new neurons, a process called neurogenesis,
can occur in areas of the brain, such as the olfactory bulb, which is
of course involved in smell as well as a region of our hippocampus, a
center of the brain involved in memory called the dentate gyrus of the
hippocampus. And there is strong evidence that new neurons can be
added to those structures throughout the lifespan. In humans, the
evidence is a little bit more controversial. It's clear that we can
add new neurons to our olfactory bulb. In fact, if any of you have
ever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=850"&gt;Anosmia: Losing Smell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had the unfortunate experience of being hit on the head too hard, the
wires called axons from those olfactory neurons that live in your nose
can get sheared off because they have to pass through a bony plate
called the cribriform plate. And the cribriform plate can shear those
axons and people can become what's called anosmic, they won't be able
to smell. But over time, those neurons unlike most all central nervous
system neurons can grow those connections back and even reestablish
new neurons being added to the olfactory bulb. They come from
elsewhere deep in the brain and they migrate through a pathway called
the rostral migratory stream. You can Google these words and look up
some of the descriptions of this if you'd like to learn more. So
indeed there is some evidence that the neurons responsible for smell
can be replaced throughout the lifespan. Certainly, in very young
individuals from birth till about age 15 or so. Whether or not they're
new neurons added to the hippocampus, the memory center of the human
brain isn't clear. Many years ago, Rusty Gage's lab at the Salk
Institute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=913"&gt;Neuronal Birthdays Near Our Death Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;did a really important study looking at terminally ill cancer patients
and injecting them with a label, a dye that is incorporated only into
new neurons. And after these patients died, their brains were
harvested. The brains were looked at and there were new neurons there,
there was evidence for new neurons. Those results I think stand over
time but what was not really discussed in the popular press discussion
around those papers was that it was very few cells that were being
added. And a number of papers have come along over the years mainly
from labs at UCSF, although from others as well, showing that if there
are new neurons added to the adult brain, it's an infinitesimally
small number of new neurons. So that's the depressing part, we don't
get new neurons. After we're born, we pretty much have the neurons
that we're going to use our entire life. And yes, as we get older and
we start to lose certain functions in our brain, we lose neurons. But
all is not lost, so to speak, because there are other ways in which
neurocircuits can create new connections and add new functions
including new memory, new abilities and new cognitive functions. And
those are mainly through the process of making certain connections,
which of course are those things we call synapses, between neurons
making those connections stronger. So they're more reliable, they're
more likely to engage as well as removing connections. And the removal
of connections is vital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1005"&gt;Circumstances for Brain Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say moving through a grieving process or removing the emotional
load of a traumatic experience. So even though we can't add new
neurons throughout our lifespan, at least not in very great numbers,
it's clear that we can change our nervous system, that the nervous
system is available for change, that if we create the right set of
circumstances in our brain, chemical circumstances, and if we create
the right environmental circumstances around us, our nervous system
will shift into a mode in which change isn't just possible but it's
probable. As I mentioned before,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1041"&gt;Brain Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the hallmark of the child nervous system is change, it wants to
change. The whole thing, everything from the chemicals that are
sloshing around in there to the fact that there's a lot of space
between the neurons. A lot of people don't know this, but early in
development there's a lot of space between the neurons. And so the
neurons can literally move around and sample different connections
very easily removing some and keeping others. As we get older, the so-
called extracellular space is actually filled up by things called
extracellular matrix and glial cells. Glial means glue. Those cells
are involved in a bunch of different processes but they start to fill
in all the space kind of like pouring concrete between rocks. And when
that happens, it becomes much harder to change the connections that
are there. One of the ways in which we can all get plasticity at any
stage throughout the lifespan is through deficits and impairments in
what we call our sensory apparati, our eyes, our ears, our nose, our
mouth, and there are some very dramatic and somewhat tragic examples
of people, for instance who have genetic mutations where they're born
without a nose and without any olfactory structures in the brain so
they cannot smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1110"&gt;No Nose, Eyes, Or Ears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case areas of the brain that normally would represent smell
become overtaken by areas of the brain involved in other things like
touch and hearing and sight. In individuals that are blind from birth,
the so-called occipital cortex, the visual cortex in the back, becomes
overtaken by hearing. The neurons there will start to respond to
sounds as well as braille touch. And actually there's a one
particularly tragic incident where a woman who was blind since birth
and because of neuroimaging studies, we knew her visual cortex was no
longer visual, it was responsible for braille reading and for hearing,
she had a stroke that actually took out most of the function of her
visual cortex. So then she was blind, she couldn't braille read or
hear. She did recover some aspect of function. Now, most people they
don't end up in that highly unfortunate situation. And what we know is
that for instance, blind people who use their visual cortex for
braille reading and for hearing, have much better auditory acuity and
touch acuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1170"&gt;Enhanced Hearing and Touch In The Blind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning they can sense things with their fingers and they can sense
things with their hearing that typical sighted folks wouldn't be able
to. In fact, you will find a much greater incidence of perfect pitch
in people that are blind. And that tells us that the brain and in
particular this area we call the neocortex, which is the outer part,
is really designed to be a map of our own individual experience. So
these, what I call experiments of impairment or loss where somebody is
blind from birth or deaf from birth or maybe has a limb development
impairment where they have a stump instead of an entire limb with a
functioning hand, their brain will represent the body plan that they
have, not some other body plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1220"&gt;Brain Maps of The Body Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the beauty of the situation is that the real estate up in the
skull, that neocortex, the essence of it is to be a customized map of
experience. Now, it is true however, that if let's say I were to be
blind when I'm 50, I'm 45 right now, I've always been sighted. If I
was blind at 50, I'll probably have less opportunity to use my
formerly visual cortex for things like braille reading and hearing
because my brain has changed, it's just not the same brain I had when
I was a baby. So there's actually a principle of biology,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1260"&gt;The Kennard Principle (Margaret Kennard)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not many people know this, it's actually a principle neurology which
is called the Kennard principle, which says, if you're going to have a
brain injury, you want to have it early in life. And of course better
to not have a brain injury at all but if you're going to have it you
want to have it early in life. And this is based on a tremendous
number of experiments examining the amount of recovery and the rate of
recovery in humans that had lesions to their brain either early in
life or later in life. So the Kennard Principle says better to have
injuries early in life. Now, that's reassuring for the young folks,
it's not so reassuring for the older folks. But there are aspects of
neuroplasticity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1296"&gt;Maps of Meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that have nothing to do with impairments. I mean earlier I said we're
all walking around with this map, this representation of the world
around us so we can see edges, we can see colors, except for folks
that are color blind of course, and we also have a map of emotional
experience. We have a map of whether or not certain people are
trustworthy, certain people aren't trustworthy. A few years ago I was
at a course and a woman came up to me and she said, you know, I wasn't
teaching the course, I was in the course and she said, "I just have to
tell you that every time you speak, it really stresses me out." And I
said, "Well I've heard that before but do you want to be more
specific?" And she said, "Yeah, your tone of voice reminds me of
somebody that I had a really terrible experience with." I said, "Well,
okay, well, I can't change my voice but I really appreciate that you
acknowledge that and it also will help explain why you seem to cringe
every time I speak", which I hadn't noticed until then but after that
I did notice. She had a very immediate and kind of visceral response
to my speech, perhaps some of you are having that right now. But in
any event, over the period of this two-week course, she would come
back every once in a while and say, "You know what I think, just by
telling you that your voice was really difficult for me to listen to,
it's actually becoming more tolerable to me." And by the end we
actually became pretty good friends and we're still in touch. And so
what this says is that the recognition of something whether or not
that's an emotional thing or a desire to learn something else is
actually the first step in neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1380"&gt;Awareness Cues Brain Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's because our nervous system has two broad sets of functions.
Some of those functions are reflexive. Things like our breathing, our
heart rate, our obvious ones, but other aspects are reflexive like our
ability to walk. If I get up out of this chair and walk out of the
door, I don't think about each step that I'm taking and that's because
I learned how to walk during development. But when we decide that
we're going to shift some sort of behavior or some reaction or some
new piece of information that we want to learn, it's something that we
want to bring into our consciousness, that awareness is a remarkable
thing because it cues the brain and the rest of the nervous system
that when we engage in those reflexive actions going forward, that
those reflexive actions are no longer fated to be reflexive. Now if
this sounds a little bit abstract, we're going to talk about protocols
for how to do this. But the first step in neuroplasticity is
recognizing that you want to change something and you should
immediately say, well, kids don't go into school and say, oh, I want
to learn language or I want to learn social interactions, and that's
the beauty of childhood. The whole brain has this switch flipped that
is making change possible but after that we have to be deliberate. We
have to know what it is exactly that we want to change. Or if we don't
know exactly what it is that we want to change, we at least have to
know that we want to change something about some specific experience.
In this case, I believe that she came and told me that my voice was
really awful for her to listen to not to make me feel bad or for any
other reason except that she wanted it to not be the case. And she
knew I wasn't going to stop talking. So she decided to call it to her
consciousness and mine as well. So that's important. If you want to
learn something or you want to change your nervous system in any way,
whether or not it's because of some impairment or because of something
that you want to acquire, a cognitive skill, a motor skill, an
emotional skill, the first thing is recognizing what that thing is.
And that often can be the hardest thing to identify but the brain has
the self recognition mechanisms and those self recognition mechanisms
are not vague, spiritual or mystical or even psychological concepts.
They are neurochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1520"&gt;The Chemistry of Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to talk next about the neurochemicals that stamp down
particular behaviors and thoughts and emotional patterns and tell the
rest of the nervous system, this is something to pay attention to
because this is in the direction of the change that I want to make. So
I'll repeat that, there are specific chemicals that when we are
consciously aware of a change we want to make or even just that we
want to make some change, chemicals are released in the brain that
allow us the opportunity to make those changes. Now, there are
specific protocols that science tells us We have to follow if we want
those changes to occur. But that self-recognition is not a kind of
murky concept. What it is is it's our fore brain, in particular our
prefrontal cortex, signaling the rest of our nervous system that
something that we're about to do, hear, feel or experience is worth
paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1575"&gt;A Giant Lie In The Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we'll pause there and then I'm going to move forward. One of the
biggest lies in the universe that seems quite prominent right now is
that every experience you have changes your brain. People love to say
this. They love to say, your brain is going to be different after this
lecture or that your brain is going to be different after today's
class than it was two days ago. And that's absolutely not true. The
nervous system doesn't just change because you experienced something
unless you're a very young child. The nervous system changes when
certain neurochemicals are released and allow whatever neurons are
active in the period in which those chemicals are swimming around, to
strengthen or weaken the connections of those neurons. Now, this is
best illustrated through a little bit of scientific history. The whole
basis of neuroplasticity is essentially ascribed to two individuals,
although there were a lot more people that were involved in this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1630"&gt;Fathers of Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those two individuals go by the name David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel.
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel started off at Johns Hopkins, moved to
Harvard medical school. And in the seventies and eighties, they did a
series of experiments, recording electrical activity in the brain.
They were in the visual cortex, meaning they put the electrodes in the
visual cortex, and they were exploring how vision works and how the
visual brain organizes all the features of the visual world to give us
these incredible things We call visual perceptions. But Hubel was a
physician. And he was very interested in what happens when for
instance, a child comes into the world and they have a cataract, the
lens of their eye, isn't clear but it's opaque. Or when a kid has a
lazy eye or the eyes have what's called strabismus, which is when the
eyes either deviate outward or inward. These are very common things of
childhood, especially in particular areas of the world. And what David
and Torsten did is they figured out that there was a critical period
in which if clear vision did not occur, the visual brain would
completely rewire itself, basically to represent whatever bit of
visual information was coming in. So they did these experiments to
kind of simulate a droopy eye or a deviating eye where they would
close one eyelid and then what they found is that the visual brain
would respond entirely to the open eye. There was sort of a takeover
of the visual brain representing the open eye. Many experiments in
many different sensory systems followed up on this. There are
beautiful experiments for instance, from Gregg Recanzone's lab up at
UC Davis and Mike Merzenich's lab at UCSF showing that for instance if
two fingers were taped together early in development, so they weren't
moving independently, the representation of those two fingers would
become fused in the brain so that the person couldn't actually
distinguish the movements and the sensations of the two fingers
separately, pretty remarkable. All of this is to say that David and
Torsten's work, for which they won a noble prize, they shared it with
Rogers Barry, their work showed that the brain is in fact a customized
map of the outside world, we said that already. But that what it's
doing is it's measuring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1770"&gt;Competition Is The Route to Plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the amount of activity for a given part of our body, one eye or the
other, or our fingers, this finger or that finger and all of those
inputs are competing for space in the brain. Now this is fundamentally
important because what it means is that if we are to change our
nervous system in adulthood, we need to think about not just what
we're trying to get, but what we're trying to give up. We can't
actually add new connections without removing something else. And that
might seem like kind of a stinger but it actually turns out to be a
great advantage. One of the key experiments that David and Torsten did
was an experiment where they closed both eyes, where they essentially
removed all visual input early in development. Now this is slightly
different than blindness because it was transient, it was only for a
short period of time. But what they found is when they did that there
was no change. However, if they would close just one eye there was a
huge change. So when people tell you, oh at the end of today's
lecture, or at the end of something your brain is going to be
completely different, that's simply not true. If you're older than 25
your brain will not change unless there's a selective shift in your
attention or a selective shift in your experience that tells the brain
it's time to change. And those changes occur through the ways I talked
about before strengthening and weakening of particular connections,
they have names like long-term potentiation, long-term depression,
which has nothing to do with emotional depression by the way, spike-
timing-dependent plasticity. I threw out those names not to confuse
you, but for those of you that would like more in-depth exploration of
those, please you can go google those and look them up, there are
great Wikipedia pages for them and you can go down the paper trail. I
might even touch on them on some subsequent episodes. But the
important thing to understand is that if we want something to change,
we really need to bring an immense amount of attention to whatever it
is that we want to change. This is very much linked to the statement I
made earlier about, it all starts with an awareness. Now, why is that
attention important? Well, David and Torsten won their Nobel prize and
they certainly deserved it. They probably deserved two because they
also figured out how vision works. And I might be biased 'cause
they're my scientific great-grandparents but I think everybody in the
field of Neuroscience agrees that Hubel and Wiesel, as they're called
H&amp;amp;W for those in the game, absolutely deserved a Nobel prize for
their work because they really unveiled the mechanisms of brain change
of plasticity. David passed away a few years ago, Torsten is still
alive, he's in his late 90s, he's still at the Rockefeller university.
He's sharp as a tack. He still jogs several miles a day. He's really
into art and a number of other things. He's also a super nice guy.
Hubel was a really nice guy as well, also he was a great Frisbee
player I discovered 'cause he beat me in a game of ultimate when he
was like 80, which still, it has me a little bit irked. But anyway,
Hubel and Wiesel did an amazing thing for science that will forever
change the way that we think about the brain. However, they were quite
wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=1950"&gt;Correcting The Errors of History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about this critical period thing. The critical period was this idea
that if you were to deprive the nervous system of an input, say
closing one eye early in development and the rest of the visual cortex
is taken over by the representation of the open eye, that you could
never change that unless you intervened early. And this actually
formed the basis for why a kid that has a lazy eye or a cataract why,
even though there's some issues with anesthesia in young children, why
now we know that you want to get in there early and fix the cataract
or fix the strabismus it's what ophthalmologists do. However, their
idea that you had to do it early or else there was no opportunity to
rescue the nervous system deficit later on turned out wasn't entirely
true. In the early 90s, a graduate student by the name of Gregg
Recanzone was in the laboratory of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF.
And they set out to test this idea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2009"&gt;Adult Brain Change: Bumps and Beeps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that if one wants to change their brain, they need to do it early in
life because the adult brain simply isn't plastic it's not available
for these changes. And they did a series of absolutely beautiful
experiments, by now I think we can say proving that the adult brain
can change provided certain conditions are met. Now, the experiments
they did are tough. They were tough on the experimenter and they were
tough on the subject. I'll just describe one. Let's say you were a
subject in one of their experiments. You would come into the lab and
you'd sit down at a table and they would record from or image your
brain and look at the representation of your fingers the digits as we
call them. And there would be a spinning drum, literally a like a
stone drum in front of your metal drum that had little bumps. Some of
the bumps were spaced close together, some of them were spaced far
apart. And they would do these experiments where they would expect
their subjects to press a lever whenever for instance, the bumps got
closer together or further apart and these were very subtle
differences. So in order to do this you really have to pay attention
to the distance between the bumps and these were not braille readers
or anyone skilled in doing these kinds of experiments. What they found
was that as people paid more and more attention to the distance
between these bumps and they would signal when there was a change by
pressing a lever, as they did that there was very rapid changes
plasticity in the representation of the fingers. And it could go in
either direction. You could get people very good at detecting the
distance between bumps, that the distance was getting smaller or that
the distance was getting greater. So people could get very good at
these tasks that you're kind of hard to imagine how they would
translate to the real world for a non braille reader. But what it told
us is that these maps of touch were very much available for
plasticity. And these were fully adult subjects. They're not taking
any specific drugs. They don't have any impairments that we're aware
of. And what it showed, what it proved is that the adult brain is very
plastic. And they did some beautiful control experiments that are
important for everyone to understand which is that sometimes they
would bring people in and they would have them touch these bumps on
this spinning drum but they would have the person pay attention to an
auditory cue. Every time a tone would go off, or there was a shift in
the pitch of that tone, they would have to signal that. So the subject
thought they were doing something related to touch and hearing and all
that showed was that it wasn't just the mere action of touching these
bumps. They had to pay attention to the bumps themselves. If they were
placing their attention on the auditory cue on the tone, well then
there was plasticity in the auditory portion of the brain but not on
the touch portion of the brain. And this really spits in the face of
this thing that you hear so often which is every experience that you
have is going to change the way your brain works. Absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2185"&gt;What It Takes to Learn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiences that you pay super careful attention to are what open
up plasticity and it opens up plasticity to that specific experience.
So the question then is why? And Merzenich and his graduate students
and postdocs went on to address this question of why. And it turns out
the answer is a very straightforward neurochemical answer. And inside
of that answer is the opportunity for any of us to change our brain at
any point throughout our lifespan, essentially for anything that we
want to learn, that could be subtracting an emotion from an experience
we've had, it could be building a greater range of emotion, it could
be learning new information like learning a new language. It could be
learning new motor skill, like dance or sport or it could be some
combination of cognitive motor. So for instance, an air traffic
controller has to do a lot with their mind in addition to a lot with
their hands. So it's not just cognitive, it's not just motor but
combined. So we're going to talk about what that chemical is but to
just give you an important hint, that chemical is the same chemical of
stress. This is not a discussion about stress per se. In a future
podcast episode, we'll talk all about stress and tools to deal with
stress, something my lab works on quite extensively. And it's a topic
that I enjoy discussing. But this is a topic about brain change. And
what I just told you is that in order to change the brain you have to
pay careful attention. And the immediate question should be well, why?
Well, the answer is that when we pay careful attention there are two
neurochemicals, neuromodulators as they're called, that are released
from multiple sites in our brain that highlight the neural circuits
that stand a chance of changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2295"&gt;Adrenalin and Alertness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's not necessarily the case that they're going to change, but
it's the first gate that has to open in order for change to occur. And
the first neurochemical is epinephrin, also adrenaline. We call it
adrenaline when it's released from the adrenal glands above our
kidneys, that's in the body, we call it epinephrin in the brain, but
they are chemically identical substances. Epinephrin is released from
a region in the brainstem called locus coeruleus. Fancy name, you
don't need to know it unless you want to. Locus coeruleus sends out
these little wires we call axons such that it hoses the entire brain
essentially in this neurochemical, epinephrin. Now it's not always
hosing the brain with epinephrin. It's only when we are in high states
of alertness that this epinephrin is released. But the way this
circuit is designed, it's very nonspecific. It's essentially waking up
the entire brain and that's because the way that epinephrin works by
binding particular receptors is to increase the likelihood that
neurons will be active. So no alertness, no neuroplasticity. However,
alertness alone is not sufficient. As we would say, it's necessary but
not sufficient for neuroplasticity. We know this is true also from the
work of Hubel and Wiesel where they looked at brain plasticity in
response to certain experiences in subjects that were either awake or
asleep. And I hate to break it to you but you cannot just simply
listen to things in your sleep and learn those materials. Later I'll
talk about how you can do certain things in your sleep that you're
unaware of that can enhance learning of things that you were aware of
while you were awake. But that is not the same as just listening to
some music or listening to a tape while you sleep and expecting it to
sink in, so to speak. Epinephrin is released when we pay attention and
when we are alert. But the most important thing for getting plasticity
is that there'll be epinephrin which equates to alertness, plus the
release of this neuromodulator, acetylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2418"&gt;The Acetylcholine Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now acetylcholine is released from two sites in the brain. One is also
in the brainstem and it's named different things in different animals,
but in humans the most rich site of acetylcholine neurons or neurons
that make acetylcholine is the parabigeminal nucleus or the
parabrachial region. There are a number of different names of these
aggregates of neurons. You don't need to know the names, all you need
to know is that you have an area in your brainstem and that area sends
wires, these axons up into the area of the brain that filters sensory
input. So we have this area of the brain called the thalamus and it is
getting bombarded with all sorts of sensory input all the time.
Costello snoring off to my right, the lights that are in the room, the
presence of my computer to my left, all of that is coming in. But when
I pay attention to something like if I really hone in on Costello
snoring, I create a cone of attention and what that cone of attention
reflects is that acetylcholine is now amplifying the signal of sounds
that Costello is making with his snoring and essentially making that
signal greater than all the signal around it, what we call signal-to-
noise goes up. So those of you with an engineering background will be
familiar with signal-to-noise. Those of you who do not have an
engineering background, don't worry about it. All it means is that one
particular shout in the crowd comes through, Costello's snoring
becomes more salient, more apparent relative to everything else going
on. Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight but epinephrin for alertness.
acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs. Those two things alone are
not enough to get plasticity. There needs to be this third component.
And the third component is acetylcholine released from an area of the
forebrain called nucleus basalis. If you really want to get technical,
it's called nucleus basalis of Meynert. For any of you that are
buddying physicians or going to medical school, you should know that.
If you have acetylcholine released from the brainstem, acetylcholine
released from nucleus basalis and epinephrin, you can change your
brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2546"&gt;The Chemical Trio For Massive Brain Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can say that with confidence because Merzenich and Recanzone as
well as other members of the Merzenich lab, Michael Kilgard and others
did these incredible experiments where they stimulated the release of
acetylcholine from nucleus basalis either with an electrode or with
some other methods that we'll talk about. And what they found was when
you stimulate these three brain regions, locus coeruleus, the
brainstem source of acetylcholine and then the basal forebrain source
of acetylcholine. When you have those three things whatever you happen
to be listening to, doing or paying attention to immediately in one
trial takes over the representation of a particular area of the brain.
You essentially get rapid massive learning in one shop. And this has
been shown again and again and again in a variety of papers also by a
guy named Norman Weinberger from UC Irvine. And it is now considered a
fundamental principle of how the nervous system works. So while Hubel
and Wiesel talked about critical periods in developmental plasticity,
it's very clear from the work of Merzenich and Weinberg and others,
that if you get these three things, if you can access these three
things of epinephrin, acetylcholine from these two sources, not only
will the nervous system change, it has to change. It absolutely will
change. And that is the most important thing for people to understand
if they want to change their brain. You cannot just passively
experience things and repetition can be important, but the way to use
repetition to change your brain is fundamentally different. So now
let's talk about how we would translate all the scientific information
and history into some protocols that you can actually apply, because I
think that's what many of you're interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2650"&gt;Ways To Change Your Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm willing to bet that most of you are not interested in lowering
electrodes into your nucleus basalis and frankly, neither am I. In
episode one of the Huberman Lab Podcast, I described the various ways
that people can monitor and change their nervous system. Those ways
include brain machine interface, pharmacology, behavioral practices,
and those behavioral practices of course can include some dos, do this
and some don'ts, don't do that, et cetera In thinking about
neuroplasticity, I want to have a very frank conversation about what
one can do but also acknowledge this untapped capacity that I'm just
not hearing about out there, which is one can also combine behavioral
practices with pharmacology. One can combine behavioral practices with
brain machine interface, and you don't have to do that. In fact, I'm
not recommending you do anything in particular. As always, I'll say it
again, I'm not a physician, so I don't prescribe anything. I'm a
professor, so I profess a lot of things. What you do with your health
and your medical care is up to you. You're responsible for your health
and wellbeing. So I'm not going to tell you what to do or what to
take. I'm going to describe what the literature tells us and suggests
about ways to access plasticity. We know we need epinephrin, that
means alertness. Most people accomplish this through a cup of coffee
and a good night's sleep. So I will say you should master your sleep
schedule and you should figure out how much sleep you need in order to
achieve alertness when you sit down to learn. All the tools and more
science than probably you ever wanted to hear about sleep and how to
get better at sleeping and timing your sleep et cetera and naps and
all of that is in episodes two, three, four, and five of the Huberman
Lab Podcast. So I encourage you to refer to those if your sleep is not
where you would like it to be. Your ability to engage in deliberate
focused alertness is in direct proportion to how well you are sleeping
on a regular basis. I think that's kind of an obvious one. So get your
sleep handled. But once that's in place, the question then is how do I
access this alertness? Well, there are a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2776"&gt;Love, Hate, &amp;amp; Shame: all the same chemical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people use some pretty elaborate psychological gymnastics. They
will tell people that they're going to do something and create some
accountability. That could be really good. Or they'll post a picture
of themselves online and they'll commit to learning a certain amount
losing, excuse me, a certain amount of weight or something like this.
So they can use either shame-based practices to potentially embarrass
themselves if they don't follow through. They'll write cheques to
organizations that they hate and insist that they'll cash them if they
don't actually follow through or they'll do it out of love, you know,
they'll decide that they're going to run a marathon or learn a
language or something because of somebody they love or they want to
devote it to somebody. The truth is that from the standpoint of
epinephrin and getting alert and activated, it doesn't really matter.
Epinephrin is a chemical and your brain does not distinguish between
doing things out of love or hate, anger or fear. It really doesn't,
all of those promote autonomic arousal and the release of epinephrin.
So I think for most people if you're feeling not motivated to make
these changes the key thing is to identify not just one but probably
at kit of reasons, several reasons as to why you would want to make
this particular change and being drawn toward a particular goal that
you're excited about can be one, also being motivated to not be
completely afraid, ashamed, or humiliated for not following through on
a goal is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2850"&gt;The Dopamine Trap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to briefly mention one little aside there because I've got
a friend who's a physician, he's a cardiologist who has a really
interesting theory. This is just theory, but I think it will resonate
with a lot of people, which is that, you've all heard of this molecule
dopamine that gives us the sense of reward when we accomplish
something. Well, we also want to be able to access dopamine while
we're working towards things, enjoy the process as they say, 'cause it
has all sorts of positive effects gives us energy, et cetera. With my
friend, what he says is, you know, there's many many instances where
someone will come to him and say, "You know what, I'm going to write a
book." And he says, "Oh, that's great. I'm sure the book's going to be
terrific and you really should write a book." And then they never go
do it. And his theory is, if you get so much dopamine from the reward
of people saying, Oh yeah, you're absolutely going to be able to do
that, you might not actually go after the reward of the accomplishment
itself. So be aware these positive reinforcements also. I'm not saying
people should flagellate themselves to the point of victory in
whatever they're pursuing, but motivation is a tricky one. So I
suggest that everyone asks themselves what is it that I want to
accomplish? And what is it that's driving me to accomplish this and
come up with two or three things. Fear-based perhaps, love-based
perhaps or perhaps several of those in order to ensure alertness,
energy and attention for the task. And that brings us to the attention
part. Now it's one thing to have an electrode embedded into your brain
and increase the amount of acetylcholine. It's another to exist in the
real world outside the laboratory and have trouble focusing. Having
trouble bringing your attention to a particular location in space for
a particular event. And there's a lot of discussion nowadays about
smartphones and devices creating a sort of attention deficit, almost
at a clinical level for many people, including adults. I think that's
largely true. And what it means, however, is that we all are
responsible for learning how to create depth of focus. There are some
important Neuroscience principles to get depth of focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=2980"&gt;Nicotine for Focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to briefly talk about the pharmacology first because I always
get asked about this. People say, "What can I take to increase my
levels of acetylcholine?" Well, there are things you can take.
Nicotine is called nicotine because acetylcholine binds to the
nicotinic receptor. There are two kinds of acetylcholine receptors,
muscarinic and nicotinic, but the nicotinic ones are involved in
attention and alertness. I have colleagues, these are not my, you know
kind of like bro, science buddies, I have those friends too, this is a
Nobel prize winning colleague who chews Nicorette while he works. He
used to be a smoker. He quit smoking because of fear of lung cancer,
seemed like a smart choice, but he missed the level of focus that he
could bring to his work. This is somebody who has had very long
career. And if you ever meet with him, unfortunately I can't name him.
If you ever meet with him what you realize is he chews about five
pieces of Nicorette an hour, which I am not suggesting people do. But
when I asked him, "Why are you doing this?" He said, "Well, increases
my alertness and focus." And also his theory and I want to really
underscore that it's theory not scientifically supported yet, is that
it offsets Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. It is true that nucleus
basalis is the primary site of degeneration in the brain, in people
that have dementia and Parkinson's and it's what leads to a lot of
their inability to focus their attention, not just deficits and
plasticity. So he might be onto something. Now I've tried chewing
Nicorette, it makes me super jittery. I don't like it because I can't
focus very well. It kind of takes me too far up the level of autonomic
arousal. I've got friends that dip Nicorette all day, some of whom are
scientists, writers and artists and musicians are familiar with the
effects of nicotine from the era where a lot of people smoked and
fortunately fewer people smoke now. So if you're interested in the
pharmacology, there are supplements and things that can increase
cholinergic transmission in the brain. I'm not suggesting you do this
but if you're going to go down that route, you want to be very careful
how much you rely on those all the time. Because the essence of
plasticity is to create a window of attention and focus that's
distinct from the rest of your day. That's what's going to create a
mark in your brain and the potential for plasticity. Things that
increase acetylcholine, besides nicotine or Nicorette, the nicotine
could come from a variety of sources or things like alpha-GPC or
choline. There are a number of these things. I would encourage you to
go to examine.com, the website and just put in acetylcholine and it
will give you a list of supplements as well as some of the dangers of
these supplements that are associated with cholinergic transmission.
But I would be remiss and I would be lying if I didn't say that there
are a lot of people out there who are using cholinergic drugs in order
to increase their level of focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=3150"&gt;Sprinting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since we're coming up on the Olympics, I don't want to get anyone
in trouble but I'm well aware that the fact that the sprinters are
really into cholinergic drugs because not only is acetylcholine
important for the focus that allows them to hear the gun and be first
out the blocks on the sprints. That's a lot of where the race is won,
hearing that gun and being the quickest on reaction time. So they take
cholinergic agents for that as well as acetylcholine is the molecule
that controls nerve to muscle contraction. So your speed of reflexes
is actually controlled by this nicotinic transmission as well. So lots
to think about in terms of acetylcholine in sport and mental acuity,
not just plasticity. Now for most of you, you probably don't want to
chew Nicorette, definitely don't want to smoke cigarettes or take
supplements for increasing acetylcholine. So what are some ways that
you can increase acetylcholine? And there, it's going to sound like a
bit of a circular argument but you to increase focus. How do you
increase focus? You know, people are so familiar with sitting down,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=3210"&gt;How to Focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reading a couple pages of a book and realizing that none of it sunk in
or talking to someone and seeing their mouth move, maybe even nodding
your head subconsciously and none of it sinks in. This can be very
damaging for school, work performance and relationships as many of you
know. Costello incidentally never seems to pay attention to anything I
say while looking directly at me, which contradicts what I'm about to
say, which is that the best way to get better at focusing is to use
the mechanisms of focus that you were born with. And the key principle
here is that mental focus follows visual focus. We are all familiar
with the fact that our visual system can be unfocused, blurry or
jumping around or we can be very laser focused on one location in
space. What's interesting and vitally important to understanding how
to access neuroplasticity is that you can use your visual focus and
you can increase your visual focus as a way of increasing your mental
focus abilities more broadly. So I'm going to explain how to do that.
Plasticity starts with alertness. And as I mentioned before, that
alertness can come from a sense of love, a sense of joy, a sense of
fear, doesn't matter. There are pharmacologic ways to access alertness
too. The most common one is of course caffeine which if you watch the
sleep episodes, you know reduces this molecule that makes us sleepy
called adenosine. I drink plenty of caffeine. I'm a heavy user of
caffeine. I don't think abuser of caffeine. I think in reasonable
amounts provided we can still fall asleep at night, caffeine can be a
relatively safe way to increase epinephrin. Now, many people are now
also using Adderall. Adderall chemically looks a lot like amphetamine
and basically it is amphetamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=3322"&gt;Adderall: Use &amp;amp; Abuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will increase epinephrin release from locus coeruleus, it will wake
up the brain and that's why a lot of people rely on it. It does have a
heavy basis for use in certain clinical syndromes prescribed such as
attention deficit. However, it also has a high probability of abuse
especially in those who are not prescribed it. Adderall will not
increase focus, it increases alertness. It does not touch the
acetylcholine system. And if those of you that are taking Adderall
say, "Well, it really increases my focus overall", that's probably
because your autonomic nervous system is just veering towards what we
call parasympathetic. You're really just very sleepy and so it's
bringing your levels of alertness up. As I mentioned, Adderall is very
problematic for a number of people as it can be habit forming.
Learning on Adderall does not always translate to high-performance off
or on Adderall at later times. And the Adderall discussion is a
broader one that perhaps we should have with a psychiatrist in the
room at some point because it is a very widely abused drug at this
point in time. The acetylcholine system and the focus that it brings
is available as I mentioned through pharmacology, but also through
these behavioral practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=3400"&gt;Seeing Your Way To Mental Focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the behavioral practices that are anchored in visual focus are
going to be the ones that are going to allow you to develop great
depth and duration of focus. So let's think about visual focus for a
second. When we focus on something visually, we have two options. We
can either look at a very small region of space with a lot of detail
and a lot of precision or we can dilate our gaze and we can see big
pieces of visual space with very little detail. It's a trade-off. We
can't look at everything at high resolution. This is why we have
these, the pupil more or less relates to the fovea of the eye which is
the area in which we have the most receptors, the highest density of
receptors that perceive light. And so our acuity is much better in the
center of our visual field than our periphery. It's a simple
experiment you can do right now. If you're listening to this, you can
still do it. You can hold your feet or your hands out in front of you.
Provided that you're sighted you should be able to see how many
fingers you have in front of you. For me, it's five. I still got all
five fingers, amazingly enough. If I move my hand off to the side, I
can't see them with precision, but as I moved them back into the
center of my visual field I can see them with precision. And that's
because the density, the number of pixels in the center of my visual
field is much higher than it is in the periphery. When we focus our
eyes, we do a couple of things. First of all, we tend to do that in
the center of our visual field and our two eyes tend to align in
what's called a vergence eye movement towards a common point. The
other thing that happens is the lens of our eye moves so that our
brain now no longer sees the entire visual world but is seeing a small
cone of visual imagery. [door banging] If it... That was the dog
bumping into the wall, forgive me. That small cone of visual imagery
or soda straw view of the world has much higher acuity, higher
resolution than if I were to look at everything. Now you see, of
course, this makes perfect sense but that's about visual attention,
not mental attention. Well, it turns out that focus in the brain is
anchored to our visual system. I'll talk about blind people in a
moment but assuming that somebody is sighted, the key is to learn how
to focus better visually, if you want to bring about higher levels of
cognitive or mental focus, even if you're engaged in a physical task.
Now there's a remarkable phenomenon in animals where animals that have
their eyes on the side of their head are scanning the entire visual
environment all the time. They're not focused on anything. Think
you're grazing animals, your cows, your sheep your birds, et cetera.
But think about a bird picking up seeds on the beach or on concrete.
That bird's head is up here. It's up about a foot off the ground, or
if it's a small bird about six inches off the ground and its eyes are
on the side of its head and yet it has this tiny beak that can quickly
pick up these little seeds off the ground with immense precision. Now,
if you try to do that by staring off to the sides of the room and
picking up items in front of you with high precision at that tiny
scale, little tiny objects, you will miss almost every time. They do
it perfectly and they don't smash their beak into the ground and
damage it, they do it with beautiful movement acuity also. So how do
they do it? How do they create this focus or this awareness of what's
in front of them? It turns out as they lower their head, their eyes,
very briefly move inward, in what's called a vergence eye movement.
Now their eyes can't actually translocate in their head, they're fixed
in the skull, just like yours and mine are. But when we move our eyes
slightly inward, maybe you can tell and do it's like so basically
shortening or making the inter pupillary distance as it's called
smaller. Two things happen. Not only do we develop a smaller visual
window into the world, but we activate a set of neurons in our
brainstem that trigger the release of both norepinephrine, epinephrin
and acetylcholine. Norepinephrine is kind of similar to epinephrin. So
in other words, when our eyes are relaxed in our head when we're just
kind of looking at our entire visual environment, moving our head
around, moving through space we're in optic flow, things moving past
us or we're sitting still, we're looking broadly at our space, we're
relaxed. When our eyes move slightly inward toward a particular visual
target our visual world shrinks, our level of visual focus goes up and
we know that this relates to the release of acetylcholine and
epinephrin at the relevant sites in the brain for plasticity. Now,
what this means is that if you have a hard time focusing your mind for
sake of reading or for listening, you need to practice and you can
practice focusing your visual system. Now this works best if you
practice focusing your visual system at the precise distance, from the
work that you intend to do for sake of plasticity. So how would this
look in the real world? Let's say, I am trying to concentrate on
something related to, I don't know, science, I'm reading a science
paper and I'm having a hard time, it's not absorbing. I might think
that I'm only looking at the paper that I'm reading. I'm only looking
at my screen, but actually my eyes are probably darting around a bit.
Experiments have been done on this. Or I'm gathering information from
too many sources in the visual environment. Now, presumably because
it's me, I've already had my coffee, I'm hydrated. I'm well rested, I
slept well. And I still experienced these challenges in focusing
spending just 60 to 120 seconds focusing my visual attention on a
small window of my screen, meaning just on my screen with nothing on
it, but bringing my eyes to that particular location increases not
just my visual acuity for that location but it brings about an
increase in activity in a bunch of other brain areas that are
associated with gathering information from this location. So put
simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus practice visual
focus. Now, if you wear contacts or you wear corrective lenses, that's
fine. You of course would want to use those. You don't want to take
those off and use a blurry image. The finer the visual image and the
more that you can hold your gaze to the visual image, the higher your
levels of attention will be. Many times on Instagram and here I've
been teased for not blinking very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=3779"&gt;Blinking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's actually a practiced thing. We blink more as we get tired,
which as you hear it you'll probably just say, duh. As we get tired,
the neurons in the brainstem that are responsible for alertness and
that hold the eyelids open start to falter and our eyelids start to
close. This is why it's hard, the words, "I could barely keep my eyes
open" which may be how you feel right now. But assuming that you're
paying attention and you're alert, when you're very alert, your eyes
are wide, your eyes are open. And as you get tired, your eyelids start
to close. Blinks, actually reset our perception of time and space.
This was shown in a beautiful paper in Current Biology. I'll be sure
to post the reference in the notes. And blinking of course is
necessary to lubricate the eyes. People blink because their eyes might
get dry. But if you can keep focused by blinking less and by focusing
your eyes to a particular location that's probably pretty creepy for
you to experience as I'm doing this. But the more that you can do this
the more that you can maintain a kind of a cone or a tunnel of mental
focus. And so I'm sort of revealing my practice which is that I've
worked very hard through blinking contest with my 14-year-old niece
who still beats me every time and it really bothers me, but also just
through my own self practice of learning to blink less and focus my
visual attention on a smaller region of space. Now for me, that's
important because I'm mainly learning things on a computer screen. If
you're going to be doing sport, it's quite a bit different and we can
discuss how you might translate to that to sport. In fact, in the next
episode, I'm going to talk all about how plasticity and the focus
mechanisms relate to learning of movement practices and coordinated
movements. It's an entire discussion unto itself but the same
principle holds. So we need alertness. You can get that through mental
tricks of motivation, fear or love, whatever it is, pharmacology,
please do it healthfully. You know, caffeine if that's in your
practice, certainly want to be well hydrated that increases actually
will increase alertness. Well, having a very full bladder will
increase alertness although you don't want your alertness to be so
high that all you can think about is the fact that you have to go
urinate 'cause that's very distracting. You don't want your alertness
to go through the roof. You need focus and visual focus is the primary
way in which we start to deploy these neurochemicals. Now you may ask,
well, what about the experiment where people were feeling this
rotating drum or listening to the auditory cue that doesn't involve
vision at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=3930"&gt;An Ear Toward Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at people who are learning things with their auditory
system, they will often close their eyes. And that's not a
coincidence. If somebody is listening very hard, please don't ask them
to look you directly in the eye while also asking that they listen to
you. That's actually one of the worst ways to get somebody to listen
to you. If you say, now listen to me and look me in the eye. The
visual system will take over and they'll see your mouth move, but
they're going to hear their thoughts more than they're going to hear
what you're saying. Closing the eyes is one of the best ways to create
a cone of auditory attention. And this is what low vision or no vision
folks do. They have tremendous capacity to focus their attention in
particular locations. Incidentally does anyone know the two animals
that have the best hearing in the world? The absolute best hearing is
many orders of magnitude better than humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=3974"&gt;The Best Listeners In The World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it's the elephant. That might not surprise you, they have
huge ears and the moth which probably will surprise you. I didn't even
know that moths could hear. but now it explains why they're so hard to
catch. If you are not sighted, you learn how to do this with your
hearing. If you're somebody who braille reads, you learn how to do
this with your fingers. If you look at great piano players like Glenn
Gould, they often times will turn their head to the side. You think
about some of the great musicians like Stevie Wonder that were blind,
right? He would look away because he had no reason to look at the
keys, but oftentimes they'll orient an ear or one side of their head
to the keys on the piano. As I mentioned before, people who are non-
sighted have better pitch. So we have these cones of attention that we
can devote. And for most people, vision is the primary way to train up
this focus of building these cones of attention. So you absolutely
have to focus on the thing that you're trying to learn. And you will
feel some agitation because of the epinephrin in your system. If
you're feeling agitation and it's challenging to focus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=4040"&gt;Agitation is Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you're feeling like you're not doing it right chances are you're
doing it right. And you can practice this ability to stare for long
periods of time without blinking. I know it's a little eerie for
people to watch, but if your goal is to learn how to control that
visual window for sake of controlling your focus, it can be an
immensely powerful portal into these mechanisms of plasticity, because
we know it engages things like nucleus basalis and these other
brainstem mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=4060"&gt;ADHD &amp;amp; ADD: Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of questions about attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, ADHD, and attention deficit disorder. Some people actually
have clinically diagnosed ADD and ADHD. And if you do, you should
certainly work with a good psychiatrist to try and figure out the
right pharmacology and/or behavioral practices for you. Many people,
however, have given themselves a low grade ADHD or ADD because of the
way that they move through their world. They are looking at their
phone a lot of the time. It's actually very easy to anchor your
attention to your phone for the following reason. First of all, it's
very restricted in size. So it's very easy to limit your visual
attention to something about this big. It's one of the design features
of the phone. The other, is that just as you've probably heard a
picture is worth a thousand words, well, a movie is worth 10,000
pictures. Anytime we're looking at things that have motion, visual
motion, our attentional system will naturally gravitate towards them,
towards those movies. It's actually much harder to read words on a
page than it used to be for many people, because we're used to seeing
things spelled out for us in YouTube videos or videos where things
move in a very dramatic. It is true that the more that we look at
those motion stimulate, the more that we're seeing movies of things
and things that are very dramatic and very intense, the worst we're
getting at attending to things like text on a page or to listening to
something like a podcast and extracting the information so much so
that I think many people have asked me, "Hey you know what, why aren't
you providing intense visuals for us to look at?" Well, frankly, it's
because a lot of people are consuming this content through pure
auditory, through, it's by listening. And I want them to be able to
digest all the material. But in addition to that, if you think about
the areas of life that dictate whether or not we become successful,
independent, healthy individuals, most of those involve the kind of
boring practices of digesting information on a page. Boring because
it's not as exciting in the moment perhaps as watching a movie or
something being spoonfed to us. But the more attention that we can put
to something, even if it's fleeting and we feel like we're only
getting little bits and pieces, shards of the information as opposed
to the entire thing, that has a much more powerful effect in engaging
this cholinergic system for plasticity than does, for instance,
watching a movie. And that's because when we watch a movie, the entire
thing can be great, it can be awesome. It can be this overriding
experience but I think for all those experiences, if you're somebody
who's interested in building your brain and expanding your brain and
getting better at various things, in feeling better, doing better, et
cetera, one has to ask how much of my neurochemical resources am I
devoting to the passive experience of letting something, just kind of
overwhelm me and excite me, versus something that I'm really trying to
learn and take away. And now there's another I enjoy movie content and
TV content all the time. I scroll Instagram often. But we are limited
in the extent to which we can grab a hold of these acetylcholine
release mechanisms or epinephrin. And I think that we need to be
careful that we don't devote all our acetylcholine and epinephrin, all
our dopamine for that matter to these passive experiences of things
that are not going to enrich us and better us. So that's a little bit
of an editorial on my part but the phone is rich with movies, it's
rich with information. The real question is is the information rich
for us in ways that grow us and cultivate smarter, more emotionally,
you know emotionally evolved people, or is it creating what's it doing
for our physical wellbeing for that matter? So I don't want to tell
people what to do or not to do but think carefully about how often
you're focusing on something and how good you are or poor you are at
focusing on something that's challenging. So once you get this
epinephrin, this alertness, you get the acetylcholine released and you
can focus your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=4320"&gt;Ultra(dian) Focus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the question is for how long? And in an earlier podcast, I talked
about these ultradian cycles that lasts about 90 minutes. The typical
learning about should be about 90 minutes. I think that learning about
will no doubt include five to 10 minutes of warmup period. I think
everyone should give themselves permission to not be fully focused in
the early part of that about. But that in the middle of that about for
the middle hour or so you should be able to maintain focus for about
an hour or so. So that for me means eliminating distractions. That
means turning off the wifi. I put my phone in the other room. If I
find myself reflexively getting up to get the phone I will take the
phone and lock it in the car outside. If I find myself going to get it
anyway, I am guilty of giving away the phone for a period of time or
even things more dramatic, I've thrown it up on my roof before so I
can't get to it till the end of the day. That thing is pretty
compelling and we come up with all sorts of reasons why we need it, to
be in contact with it but I encourage you to try experiencing what it
is to be completely immersed in an activity where you feel the
agitation that your attention is drifting but you continually bring it
back. And that's an important point which is that attention drifts,
but we have to re-anchor it. We have to keep grabbing it back. And the
way to do that, if you're sighted is with your eyes. That as your
attention drifts, and you look away you want to try and literally
maintain visual focus on the thing that you're trying to learn. Feel
free to blink, of course, but you can greatly increase your powers of
focus and the rates of learning which is anchored in all the work of
Merzenich, Hubel and Wiesel and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=4410"&gt;When Real Change Occurs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that's the trigger for plasticity, but the real secret is that
neuroplasticity doesn't occur during wakefulness. It occurs during
sleep. We now know that if you focus very hard on something for about
90 minutes or so, maybe you even do several bouts of that per day. If
you can do that, some people can, some people can only do one focus
about of learning, that night and the following nights, while you're
asleep the neural circuits that were highlighted if you will with
acetylcholine transmission will strengthen and other will be lost,
which is wonderful because that's the essence of plasticity. And what
it means is that when you eventually wake up a couple of days or a
week later, you will will have acquired the knowledge forever unless
you go through some process to actively unlearn it. And we will talk
about unlearning in a later episode. So mastering sleep is key in
order to reinforce the learning that occurs. But let's say you get a
really poor night of sleep after a about of learning. Chances are, if
you sleep the next night or the following night that learning will
occur. There's a stamp in the brain where this acetylcholine was
released. It actually marks those synapses neurochemically and
metabolically, so that those are synopses are more biased to change.
Now, if you don't ever get that deep sleep then you probably won't get
those changes. There's also a way in which you can bypass the need for
deep sleep at least partially by engaging in what I call Non Sleep
Deep Rest, these NSDR protocols. But I just want to discuss the signs
of this. There was a paper that was published in Cell Reports last
year that shows that if people did, it was a spatial memory task,
actually quite difficult one where they had to remember the sequence
of lights lighting up and if they're just two or three lights in a
particular sequence it's easy but as you get up to 15 or 16 lights and
numbers in the sequence it actually gets quite challenging. If
immediately after, and it was immediately after the learning the
actual performance of this task, people took a 20 minute Non Sleep
Deep Rest protocol or took a shallow nap, so lying down, feet slightly
elevated perhaps, just closing their eyes, no sensory input, the rates
of learning were significantly higher for that information than where
the two just had a good night's sleep the following night. So you can
actually accelerate learning with these NSDR protocols or with brief
naps, 90 minutes or less. So the key to plasticity in childhood is to
be a child. The key to plasticity in adulthood is to engage alertness,
engage focus and then to engage Non Sleep Deep Rest and deep sleep
while you're in your typical about of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=4580"&gt;How Much Learning Is Enough?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always get asked, "How many bouts of learning can I perform?" Well,
I know people that train up these visual focus mechanisms to the point
where they can do several 90 minute bouts throughout the day, as many
as three or four. And some of them are also inserting Non Sleep Deep
Rest as well. Now that can get pretty tricky. A lot of people find
that they can recover best from these intense bouts of focused
learning by doing some motor activity where you get into self-
generated optic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=4610"&gt;Learning In (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that should make sense if you've ever heard me lecture about
stress which I've done a little bit in various podcasts. When we are
in a mode of self-generated optic flow like walking or running or
cycling and things are just floating past us on our retina, we're not
really looking anywhere in particular, so this is the opposite of a
tight window of focus. When we do that, there are areas of the brain
like the amygdala which are involved in releasing epinephrin and
create alertness. At the extremes, it creates fear but certainly
alertness, those are all shut down. So it's its own form of non sleep
deep rest. So some people find it much more pleasurable and practical
to engage in a focused about of learning and then go do some activity
that involves what we would essentially call worldlessness where
you're not really thinking about much of anything. And so for those of
you that listen to audio books or podcasts while you run you may want
to consider whether or not that's how you want to spend your time
right now. I'd love it if you were listening to this podcast while you
run or cycle, but I'm much more interested in you actually getting the
benefits of neuroplasticity than just listening to me for the sake of
listening to me. So for many people letting the mind drift where it's
not organized in thought after a period of very deliberate focused
effort is the best way to accelerate learning and depth of learning.
And there are good scientific data to support these sorts of things,
including the Cell Reports paper that I mentioned a few moments ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=4696"&gt;Synthesis/Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to synthesize some of the information that we've covered up
until now. This entire month is about neuroplasticity. Today's episode
has covered a lot, but by no means has it covered all of the potential
for neuroplasticity and protocols for plasticity. We will get into all
of it. But today I want to make sure that these key elements that form
the backbone of neuroplasticity are really embedded in people's minds.
First of all, plasticity occurs throughout the lifespan. Early, from
birth until 25, mere exposure to a sensory event can create
plasticity. That could be a good thing or a bad thing. We're going to
talk about unlearning the bad stuff, traumas, et cetera in a
subsequent episode this month. If you want to learn as an adult, you
have to be alert. It might seem so obvious but I think a lot of people
don't think about when in their 24 hour cycle, they're most alert.
There are four episodes devoted to that 24-hour cycle and the cycles
of alertness and sleep. I encourage you to listen to those if you
haven't had the opportunity to yet or just ask yourself when during
the day do you typically tend to be most alert? That will afford you
an advantage in learning specific things during that period of time.
So don't give up that period of time for things that are meaningless,
useless, or not aligned with your goals. That'd be a terrible time to
get into passive observance or just letting your time get soaked away
by something. That is a valuable asset, that epinephrin, released from
your brainstem is going to occur more readily at particular phases of
your 24-hour cycle than others, during the waking phase of course. You
should know when those are. And then you could start to think about
the behavioral practices, maybe the pharmacologic practices like
caffeine, hydration, et cetera that will support heightened levels of
alertness. Attention is something that can be learned and attention is
critical for creating that condition where whatever it is that you are
engaging in will modify your brain in a way that you won't have to
spend so much attention on it going forward. That's the essence of
plasticity, that things will eventually become reflexive. The language
that you're learning, the motor movement, the cognitive skill, the
ability to suppress an emotional response or to engage in emotional
response depending on what your goals are and what's appropriate for
you. Increasing acetylcholine can be accomplished pharmacologically
through nicotine. However, there are certain dangers for many people
to do that as well as the cost, financial cost, learning how to engage
the cholinergic system through the use of the visual system,
practicing how long can you maintain focus with blinks as you need
them, but how long can you maintain visual focus on a target, just on
a piece of paper set a few feet away in the room or at the level of
your computer screen. These are actually things that people do in
communities where high levels of visual focus are necessary. Now, the
other way to get high levels of visual focus and alertness is to have
a panic or to have a situation that's very, very bad. You will be
immediately focused on everything related to that situation, but
that's unfortunate. What we're really talking about here is trying to
harness the mechanisms of attention and get better at paying
attention. You may want to do that with your auditory system, not with
your visual system, either because you're low vision or no vision, or
because you're trying to learn something that relates more to sounds
than to what you see. But for most people they're trying to learn
information, cognitive information, or they're trying to learn how to
hear the nuance in their partner's explanations of their emotionally
challenging events, et cetera. And just remember, by the way, what I
said earlier, which is that if you really want somebody to listen to
you and really hear what you're saying and what's underlying it, you
should not, and cannot expect them to look directly at you while you
do that. That's actually going to limit their ability to focus. I'm
trying to rescue a few folks out there who might be in this struggle.
I of course have never been in this struggle. And that was supposed to
be a joke. I'm very familiar with that struggle but I know that one
can get better at listening, one can get better at learning, one can
get better at all sorts of things by anchoring in these mechanisms.
Now, of course you can also combine protocols. You can decide to
combine pharmacology with these learning practices. Many people in
communities do that. Many people are doing that naturally by drinking
their coffee right before they do their learning. But I would also
encourage you to think about how long those learning bouts are. If you
think you have ADD or ADHD, see a clinician but you should also ask
yourself are you giving up the best period of focus that you have each
day naturally to some other thing like social media or some other
activity that doesn't serve you well or are you devoting that period
to the opportunity to learn? You should also ask yourself whether or
not you're trying to focus too much for too long during the day. I
know some very high performing individuals, very high-performing in a
variety of contexts and none of them are focused all day long. Many of
them take walks down the hallway, sometimes mumbling to themselves,
they're not paying attention to anything else. They go for bike rides,
they take walks. They are not trying to engage their mind at maximum
focus all the time. Very few people do that because we learn best in
these 90 minute bouts inside of one of these ultradian cycles. And I
should repeat again, that within that 90-minute cycle, you should not
expect yourself to focus for the entire period of one 90-minute cycle.
The beginning and end are going to be a little bit flickering in and
out of focus. How do you know when one of these 90-minute cycles is
starting, or typically when you wake up os the beginning of the first
90-minute cycle, but it's not down to the minute. You'll be able to
tap into your sense of these 90-minute cycles as you start to engage
in these learning practices should you choose. And then of course
getting some non sleep deep rest or just deliberate disengagement,
such as walking or running, or just sitting, eyes closed or eyes open
you kind of mindlessly it might seem in a chair, just letting your
thoughts move around after a learning about will accelerate the rate
of plasticity that's been shown in quality peer reviewed studies. And
then of course, deep sleep. And so what we can start to see is that
plasticity is your natural right early in life. But after about age 25
you have to do some work in order to access it. But fortunately, these
beautiful experiments of Hubel and Wiesel and Merzenich and Weinberger
and others point in the direction of what allows us to achieve
plasticity, it points to the neurochemicals and the circuits. And we
now have behavioral protocols that allow us to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as&amp;amp;t=5115"&gt;Learning With Repetition, Forming Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really want to emphasize that there's an entire other aspect of
behavioral practices that will allow us to engage in plasticity that
don't involve intense focus on emotionality but involve a lot of
repetition. So there's another entire category of plasticity that
involves doing what seemed like almost mundane things but doing them
over and over again repeatedly and incorporating the reward system
that involves dopamine. So today I talked about the kind of plasticity
that comes from extreme focus. You would get that extreme focus and
alertness naturally through a harder, difficult event that you didn't
want. That's the kind of stinger but your brain is designed to keep
you safe so it wants to get one trial learning from things like
touching a hot stove or engaging with a really horrible person. You
can get incredible plasticity of positive experiences of things that
you want by engaging this high focus regime and then rest, non sleep
deep rest, and sleep. And there's another aspect of plasticity which
we will explore next episode as well as when we explore movement-based
practices for enhancing plasticity and plasticity of movement itself.
And those are not of the high attention kind of high emotionality or
in the intensity of the experiences that I described today. Those are
more about repetition and reward and repeat, repetition, reward,
repeat, and they are used for a distinctly different category of
behavioral change more of which relate to habits as opposed to
learning of particular types of information that allow us to perform
physically, cognitively or adjust our emotional system. So I'm going
to stop there. I'm sure there are a lot of questions. Please put your
questions in the comment section below and please remember that this
entire month we're going to be exploring neuroplasticity. So this
discussion/lecture, I wish it was more of a back and forth, but this
is what the format offers us. So please do put your questions in the
comment section and I will address them in the other episodes coming
soon on neuroplasticity. As I say that I'm reminded that many of you
are listening to this on Apple or Spotify and therefore there isn't an
opportunity to leave comments aside from the rating section on Apple.
So if you have specific topics related to neuroplasticity that you
would like me to cover in the subsequent episodes this month please go
to the YouTube, subscribe, but as well please put your question in the
comment section for this episode and I'll be sure to read them and
respond. Many of you have very graciously asked how you can help
support the Huberman Lab Podcast. Best way to do that is to subscribe
on YouTube. You might want to also hit the notification button so that
you don't miss any upcoming episodes. Leave a comment, as well if you
go to Apple, you can give us a 5-star rating and there's a place there
where also you can leave a comment. And if you prefer to listen on
Spotify subscribe and download on Spotify. In addition, it's always
helpful if you recommend the podcast to your friends and family and
others who you think might benefit from the information and as well,
please check out our sponsors. That's a great way to help us. Today
and in previous episodes, I've talked a number of times about
supplements. I'm very pleased that we're partnering with Thorne, T-h-
o-r-n-e supplements because Thorne has the very high levels of
stringency in terms of product quality and precision about how much of
given supplements are in the bottle which is vital and not all
supplement companies have stood up to the test on that one. If you
want to check out Thorne and go to Thorne that's
thorne.com/u/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get 20% off any
supplements that you purchase. I've also listed there a gallery of
supplements that I take, including magnesium glycinate. I know in
previous episodes, I talked about magnesium threonate as a sleep aid
that I take. magnesium glycinate and magnesium threonate are
essentially interchangeable. Thanks so much for your time and
attention, and as always thank you for your interest in science.

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=0"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to
bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science
related tools. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep. Helix
Sleep makes mattresses that are ideally suited to your sleep needs.
Helix mattresses are amazing. I can say this because I've been
sleeping on one and I've been sleeping better than I've ever slept
before. The interesting thing about Helix mattresses is that they're
tailored to your unique body type and sleeping style. What's a
sleeping style? Well, if you go to the Helix site you can take a quick
quiz, it takes about two minutes, as to whether or not you sleep on
your stomach, your side, your back, whether or not you flip back and
forth, or whether or not you don't know in what position you sleep, as
well as whether or not you tend to run hot or run cold, wake up cold,
wake up hot, et cetera. If you do that then it will match you to the
mattress that's perfect for your sleep needs. If you wanna try a Helix
mattress, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman. And if you do that,
you'll get $200 off your order as well as two free pillows. That's
helixsleep.com/huberman. The second sponsor of today's podcast is
Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012, and I
started using it because I had a lot of confusion about what vitamins
and minerals I should take. And taking Athletic Greens allowed me to
get the foundation or sort of the base of everything I need in one
easy to consume formula. It tastes great. I mix mine with water and a
little bit of lemon juice, and I like drinking it. And the probiotics
in there are important to me as well, because there are a lot of data
out there now identifying the gut microbiome and the importance of the
gut-brain axis for immune function, metabolic function and so forth.
If you want to try Athletic Greens you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that they'll also send you
a year supply of liquid vitamin D3, K2. There are a lot of data
starting to surface about the importance of vitamin D3 for immune
function, metabolic function, endocrine function, and so forth. In
addition, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, you'll get the
year supply of D3 and K2 as well as five free travel packs, which are
a little packets of Athletic Greens in addition to your normal order.
And those are great for when you're on the plane, or you're otherwise
traveling. They mix up really easily without any mess or the needs of
spoon out powder and things of that sort. So the things that are easy
to do at home are kind of harder on the road, those packets make it
easy while on the road. Today we're gonna talk about dreaming,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=180"&gt;The Dream Mask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learning during dreaming and unlearning during dreaming. In particular
unlearning of troubling emotional events. Now my interest in dreaming
goes way back. When I was a child I had a friend and he came over one
day and he brought with him a mask that had a little red light in the
corner. He had purchased this thing through some magazine ad that he
had seen, and this mask was supposed to trigger lucid dreaming. Lucid
dreaming is the experience of dreaming during sleep, but being aware
that one is dreaming. And in some cases being able to direct one's
dream activities. So if you're in a lucid dream and you wanna fly, for
instance, some people report being able to initiate that experience of
flying. Or to contort themselves into an animal, or to transport
themselves to wherever they want within the dream. I tried this
device. The way it worked is you put on the mask during a waking
state, I'm wide awake, and you look at the little light flashing in
the corner, and then you'd also wear it when you went to sleep at
night. And indeed, while I was asleep I could see the red light
presumably through my eyelids. Although, for all I know I had opened
my eyes. I don't know I was asleep. And then, because I was dreaming
and I was experiencing something very vivid, I was able to recognize
that I was dreaming and then start to direct some of the events within
that dream. Now lucid dreaming occurs in about 20% of people and in a
small percentage of those people they lucid dream almost every night.
So much so that many of them report their sleep not being as
restorative as it would be otherwise. Now all of this is to say that,
lucid dreaming and dreaming are profound experiences. We tend to feel
extremely attached to our dream experience. This may explain the
phenomenon of people who have a very intense dream they need to
somehow tell everybody about that dream, or tell someone about that
dream. I don't really know what that behavior is about, but sometimes
we wake up and we feel so attached to what happened in this state that
we call dreaming that there seems to be an intense need to share it
with other people, presumably to process it and make sense of it. Now
numerous people throughout history have tried to make sense of dreams
in some sort of organized way. The most famous of which of course is a
Sigmund Freud who talked about symbolic representations in dreams. A
lot of that has been kind of debunked. Although, I think that there's
some interest in what the symbols of dreaming are. And this is
something that we'll talk about in more depth today, although not
Freud in theory, in particular. So I think in order to really think
about dreams and what to do with them and how to maximize the dream
experience for sake of learning and unlearning, the best way to
address this is to look at the physiology of sleep, to really address
what do we know concretely about sleep. So first of all, as we get
sleepy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=360"&gt;Cycling Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we tend to shut our eyes, and that's 'cause there's some autonomic
centers in the brain, some neurons that control closing of the eyelids
when we get sleepy. And then we transitioned into sleep. And sleep,
regardless of how long we sleep is generally broken up into a series
of 90 minute cycles. These ultradian cycles. So early in the night
these 90 minute cycles tend to be comprised more of shallow sleep and
slow wave sleep. So stage one, stage two, et cetera, and what we call
slow wave sleep. I'll go into detail about what all this means in a
moment. And we tend to have less so-called REM sleep, R-E-M sleep,
which stands for rapid eye movement sleep. And I'll talk about rapid
eye movement sleep in detail. So early in the night, a lot more slow
wave sleep and less REM. For every 90 minute cycle that we have during
a night of sleep we tend to start having more and more REM sleep. So
more of that 90 minute cycle is comprised of REM sleep and less of
slow wave sleep. Now this is true regardless of whether or not you
wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom or your sleep
is broken. The more sleep you're getting across the night, the more
REM sleep you're going to have. And REM sleep and non REM, as I'll
refer to it, have distinctly different roles in learning and
unlearning, and they are responsible for learning and unlearning of
distinctly different types of information. And this has enormous
implications for learning of motor skills, for unlearning of traumatic
events, or for processing emotionally challenging as well as
emotionally pleasing events. And as we'll see, one can actually
leverage their daytime activities in order to access more slow wave
sleep or non REM sleep as we'll call it, or more REM sleep depending
on your particular emotional and physical needs. So it's really a
remarkable stage of life that we have a lot more control and power
over then you might believe. We'll also talk about lucid dreaming.
We're also gonna talk about hallucinations and how drug induced
hallucinations have a surprising similarity to a lot of dream states
and yet some really important differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=490"&gt;Chemical Cocktails of Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So let's start by talking about slow wave sleep, or non REM
sleep. And I realized that slow wave sleep and non REM sleep aren't
exactly the same thing. So for you sleep aficionados out there, I am
lumping right now. As we say in science, there are lumpers and there
are splitters and I am both. Sometimes I lump, sometimes I split. For
sake of clarity and ease of conversation right now I'm gonna be a
lumper. When I say slow wave sleep, I mean non REM sleep generally.
Although, I acknowledge there is a distinction. Slow wave sleep. So
slow wave sleep is characterized by a particular pattern of brain
activity in which the brain is metabolically active, but that there's
these big sweeping waves of activity that include a lot of the brain.
If you wanna look this up you can find evidence for sweeping of waves
of neural activity across association cortex, across big swaths of the
brainstem, the so-called pons geniculate occipital pathway. This is
brainstem, thalamus, and then cortex for those of you that are
interested. Although, more of that is going to occur in REM sleep. Now
the interesting thing about slow wave sleep are the neuromodulators
that tend to be associated with it, that are most active and least
active during slow wave sleep and here's why. To remind you
neuromodulators are these chemicals that act rather slowly but their
main role is to bias particular brain circuits to be active and other
brain circuits to not be active. These are like the music playlist. So
think of neuromodulators and these come in the names of,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine, think of them
as suggesting playlists on your audio device. So, you know, classical
music is distinctly different in feel and tone and a number of other
features from like third wave punk, or from, you know, hip hop, right?
So think of them as biasing toward particular genres of neural circuit
activity, okay. Mellow music versus really aggressive fast music, or
rhythmic music that includes lyrics versus rhythmic music that doesn't
include lyrics. It's more or less the way to think about these
neuromodulators. And they are associated as a consequence with certain
brain functions. So we know for instance and just to review,
acetylcholine in waking states is a neuromodulator that tends to
amplify the activity of brain circuits associated with focus and
attention. Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify
the brain circuits associated with alertness, and the desire to move.
Serotonin is the neuromodulator that's released intense to amplify the
circuits in the brain and body that are associated with bliss and the
desire to remain still. And dopamine is the neuromodulator that's
released and is associated with amplification of the neural circuits
in the brain and body associated with pursuing goals and pleasure and
reward. Okay. So in slow wave sleep something really interesting
happens. There is essentially no acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
production and release and action from the two major sites, which are
in the brainstem, which from a nucleus if it's a parabigerminal
nucleus, if you really wanna know, or from the forebrain, which is
nucleus basalis. And you don't need to know these names but if you
like, that's why I put them out there. Acetylcholine production
plummets. It's just almost to zero. And acetylcholine as I just
mentioned, is associated with focus. So you can think of slow wave
sleep as these big sweeping waves of activity through the brain and a
kind of distortion of space and time, so that we're not really
focusing on any one thing. Now the other molecules that are very
active at that time are norepinephrine. Which is a little bit
surprising 'cause normally in waking states norepinephrine is gonna be
associated with a lot of alertness and the desire to move. But there's
not a ton of norepinephrine around in slow wave sleep, but it is
around. So there's something associated with the movement circuitry
going on in slow wave sleep. And remember, this is happening mostly at
the beginning of the night, your sleep is dominated by slow wave
sleep. So no acetylcholine, very little norepinephrine, although there
is some and a lot of serotonin. And serotonin again is associated with
this desire, this sensation of kind of bliss or wellbeing, but not a
lot of movement. And during sleep you tend not to move. Now in slow
wave sleep you can move, you're not paralyzed. So you can roll over.
If people are going to sleep walk, typically it's going to be during
slow wave sleep. And what studies have shown through some kind of
sadistic experiments where people are deprived specifically of slow
wave sleep, and that can be done by waking them up as soon as the
electrode recording show that they're in slow wave sleep or by
chemically altering their sleep so that it biases them away from slow
wave sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=780"&gt;Motor Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What studies have shown is that motor learning is generally occurring
in slow wave sleep. So let's say the day before you go to sleep you
were learning some new dance move, or you were learning some specific
motor skill, either a fine motor skill or a course motor skill. So
let's say, it's a new form of exercise or some new coordinated
movements. This could be coordinate movement at the level of the
fingers, or it could be coordinated movement the level of whole body
and large limb movements. It could involve other people, or it could
be a solo activity. Learning of those skills is happening primarily
during slow wave sleep in the early part of the night. In addition,
slow wave sleep has been shown to be important for the learning of
detailed information. Now this isn't always cognitive information.
We're gonna talk about cognitive information, but the studies that
have been done along these lines involve having people learn very
detailed information about very specific rules and the way that
certain words are spelled, they tend to be challenging words. So if
people are tested and in terms of their performance on these types of
exams and they're deprived of slow wave sleep, they tend to perform
very poorly. So we can think of slow wave sleep as important for motor
learning, motor skill learning and for the learning of specific
details about specific events. And this turns out to be fundamentally
important because now we know that slow wave sleep is primarily in the
early part of the night, and motor learning is occurring primarily
early in the night, and detailed learning is occurring early in the
night. Now for those of you that are waking up after only three, four
hours of sleep, this might be informative. This might tell you a
little something about what you are able to learn and not able to
learn if that were to be the only sleep that you get. Although,
hopefully that's not the only sleep that you get. But we're going to
dive deep into how it is that one can maximize motor learning in order
to extract say, more detail information about coordinated movements
and how to make them faster or slower. So that might be important for
certain sports. It might be almost certainly important for certain
sports. It's gonna be important for any kind of coordinated movement,
like say learning to play the piano, or for instance, how to learn
synchronized movements with somebody else. So maybe I mentioned the
example of dance earlier. Like me a few years ago, I set out to learn
tango because I have some Argentine relatives and I was a Bismal. I
need to return to that at some point. I was just a Bismal. And one of
the worst things about being a bismal at learning dance is that, that
somebody else has to suffer the consequences also. So I don't know
maybe in the month on neuroplasticity, I'll explore that again as a
self experimentation. But, the key things to know are slow wave sleep
is involved in motor learning and detailed learning. There's no
acetylcholine around at that time, has these big amplitude activity
sweeping throughout the brain and that there's the release of these
neuromodulators, norepinephrine and serotonin. And again, that's all
happening early in the night. So athletes, people that are concerned
about performance, if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours
of,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=990"&gt;High Performance with Less Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you know, three, four hours of sleep because you're excited about a
competition the next day, presumably if you've already trained the
skills that you need for the event you should be fine to engage in
that particular activity. Now it's always going to be better to get a
full night's sleep. And that, you know, a full night's sleep for you
is six hours then it's always gonna be better to get more sleep than
it is to get less. However, I think some people get a little bit
overly concerned that if they didn't get their full night's sleep
before some sort of physical event that their performance is going to
plummet. Presumably, if you've already learned what you need to do,
and it's stored in your neural circuits and you know how to make those
coordinated movements, what the literature on slow wave sleep suggest
is that you would be replenished. That the motor learning and the
recovery from exercise is going to happen early in the night. Okay. So
we'll just pause there, and kind of shelve that for a moment and then
we're gonna come back to it. But I wanna talk about REM sleep, or
rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, as I
mentioned before, occurs throughout the night, but you're gonna have
more of it. A larger percentage of these 90 minute sleep cycles is
going to be comprised of REM sleep as you get toward morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1065"&gt;Rapid Eye Movement Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REM sleep is fascinating. It was discovered in '50s when a sleep
laboratory in Chicago, the researchers observed that people's eyes
were moving under their eyelids. Now, something very important that
we're going to address when we talk about trauma later is that, the
eye movements are not just side to side they're very erratic in all
different directions. One thing that I don't think I've never heard
anyone really talk about publicly is, why eye movements during sleep,
right? Eyes are closed. And sometimes people's eyelids will be a
little bit open and their eyes are darting around, especially in
little kids. I don't suggest you do this. I'm not even sure it's
ethical. But, it has been done where you, you know, pull back the
eyelids of a kid while they're sleeping and their eyes are kind of
darting all over the place. I think people do this to their passed out
friends at parties and things like that. So again, I don't suggest you
do it, but I'm telling you it because it's been done before and
therefore you don't have to do it again. But rapid eye movement sleep
is fascinating and occurs because there are connections between the
brainstem, an area called the pons, and areas of the thalamus and the
top of the brain stem that are involved in generating movements in
different directions, sometimes called saccades. Although, sometimes
during rapid eye movement sleep it's not just rapid, it's kind of a
jittery side to side thing and then the eyeballs kind of role. It's
really pretty creepy to look at if you see. So what's happening there
is the circuitry that is involved in conscious eye movements is kind
of going haywire, but it's not haywire. It's these waves of activity
from the brainstem up to the so-called thalamus, which is an area that
filter sensory information and then up to the cortex. And the cortex
of course, is involved in conscious perceptions. So in rapid eye
movement sleep there are a couple of things are happening besides
rapid eye movements. The main ones are that they're, I should say, in
contrast to slow wave sleep. In REM sleep serotonin is essentially
absent. Okay? So this molecule, this neuromodulator that tends to
create the feeling of bliss and wellbeing and just calm placidity is
absent. All right. So that's interesting. In addition to that,
norepinephrine this molecule that's involved in movement and alertness
is absolutely absent. It's probably one of the few times in our life
that epinephrin is essentially at zero activity within our system. And
that has a number of very important implications for the sorts of
dreaming that occur during REM sleep and the sorts of learning that
can occur in REM sleep and unlearning. First of all in REM sleep, we
are paralyzed. We are experiencing what's called atonia,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1230"&gt;Paralysis &amp;amp; Hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which just means that we're completely laid out and paralyzed. We also
tend to experience whatever it is that we're dreaming about as a kind
of hallucination, or a hallucinatory activity. Long ago I looked into
hallucinations and dreaming I was just fascinated by this in high
school. And there's some great books on this if you're interested in
exploring the relationship between hallucinations and dreaming. The
most famous of which are from a guy, a researcher at Harvard, Alan
Hobson, you know, wrote a book called, Dream Drug Store. And talked
all about the similarities between drugs that induce hallucinations
and dreaming in REM. So you can explore that if you like. So in REM
our eyes are moving, but the rest of our body is paralyzed and we are
hallucinating. There's no epinephrin around. Epinephrin doesn't just
create a desire to move and alertness. It is also the chemical
signature of fear and anxiety. It's what's released from our adrenal
glands when we experience something that's fearful or alerting. So if
a car suddenly screeches in front of us, or we get a troubling text
message, adrenaline is deployed into our system. Adrenaline is
epinephrin, those are equivalent molecules. And epinephrin isn't just
released from our adrenals it's also released within our brain. So
there's this weird stage of our life that happens more toward morning,
that we call REM sleep, where we're hallucinating and having these
outrageous experiences in our mind, but the chemical that's associated
with fear and panic and anxiety is not available to us. And that turns
out to be very important. And you can imagine why that's important.
It's important because it allows us to experience things, both replay
of things that did occur as well as elaborate contortions of things
that didn't occur. And it allows us to experience those in the absence
of fear and anxiety, and that it turns out is very important for
adjusting our emotional relationship to challenging things that
happened to us while we were awake. Those challenging things can
sometimes be in the form of social anxiety, or just having been
working very hard or concern about an upcoming event, or sometimes
people report for instance, dreams where they find themselves late to
an exam, or naked in public, or in some sort of situation that would
be very troubling to them. And that almost certainly occurs during REM
sleep. So we have this incredible period of sleep in which our
experience of emotionally laid in events is dissociated. It's
chemically blocked from us having the actual emotion. Now probably
immediately some of you are thinking, "Well, what about nightmares? I
have nightmares and those carry a lot of emotion, or sometimes I'll
wake up in a panic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1415"&gt;Nightmares&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's consider each of those two things separately because they are
important in understanding REM sleep. There's a good chance that
nightmares are occurring slow wave sleep. There are actually some
drugs that I don't suggest people take. In fact so much so I'm not
gonna mention them that give people very kind of scary or eerie dreams
and this kind of feeling that things are pursuing them, or that they
can't move when they are being chased. That's actually a common dream
that I've had. I guess, it's more or less a nightmare. The feeling
that one is paralyzed and can't move and is being chased. A lot of
people have said, "Oh, that must be in REM sleep." Because you're
paralyzed and so you're dreaming about being paralyzed and you can't
move. I think that's probably false. The research says that because no
epinephrine is absent during REM sleep, it's very unlikely that you
can have these intense, fearful memories. So those are probably
occurring in slow wave sleep. Although, there might be instances where
people have nightmares in REM sleep. The other thing is some people
experience, certainly I've had this experience, of waking up and
feeling very stressed about whatever it was that I happen to be
thinking about, or dreaming about in the moments before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1485"&gt;When REM &amp;amp; Waking Collide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's an interesting case of an invasion of the dream state into
the waking state and the moment you wake up epinephrine is available.
So the research on this isn't fully crystallized,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1500"&gt;Sleeping While Awake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but most of it points in the direction of the experience of waking up
and feeling very panicked. Maybe, I wanna highlight may, but maybe
that you were experiencing something that was troubling in the
daytime, you're repeating that experience in your sleep, epinephrine
is not available, and therefore the brain circuits associated with
fear and anxiety are shut off. And so you're able to process those
events and then suddenly you wake up and there's a surge of adrenaline
of epinephrin that's now coupled to that experience. So nightmares
very likely in slow wave sleep and that kind of panic on waking from
something very likely to be an invasion of the thoughts and ideas,
however distorted in REM sleep invading the waking state. In fact,
that brings to mind something that I've mentioned once before, but I
wanna mention again, this atonia, this paralysis that we experience
during sleep can invade the waking state. Many people report the
experience of waking up and being paralyzed. They're legitimately
waking up, it's not a dream. Waking up and being paralyzed, and it is
terrifying. I've had this happen before. It is I can tell you
terrifying to be wide awake, and as far as I could tell fully
conscious, but unable to move. And then generally you can jolt
yourself out of it in a few seconds, but it is quite frightening. Now
some people actually experience waking up, being fully paralyzed and
hallucinating. And there is a theory in the academic and scientific
community at least, that what people report as alien abductions have a
certain number of core characteristics that map quite closely, yearly
similarly to these experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1605"&gt;Alien Abductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of reports of alien abduction involve people being unable to
move, seeing particular faces, hallucinating, extensively feeling like
their body is floating, or they were transported. This is very similar
to the experience of invasion of atonia into the waking state, waking
up and still being paralyzed. As well as the hallucinations that are
characteristic of dreaming and REM sleep. Now I'm not saying that
people's alien abductions were not legitimate alien abductions, how
could I, I wasn't there. And if I was there I wouldn't tell you 'cause
that would make me an alien, and I wouldn't want you to know. But it
is quite possible that people are experiencing these things and they
are an invasion of the sleep state into the waking state and they can
last several minutes or longer. And because in dreams, space and time
are distorted, our perception of these events could be that they
lasted many hours and we can really feel as if they lasted many hours,
when in fact they took only moments. And we're gonna return to
distortion of space and time in a little bit. So to just recap we've
gone so far. Slow wave sleep early in the night. It's been shown to be
important for motor learning and for detailed learning. REM sleep has
a certain dream component when which there's no epinephrin, therefore
we can't experience anxiety, we are paralyzed. Those dreams tend to be
really vivid and have a lot of detail to them. And yet in REM sleep
what's very clear is that the sorts of learning that happened in REM
sleep are not motor events. It's more about unlearning of emotional
events. And now we know why, because the chemicals available for
really feeling those emotions are not present. Now that has very
important implications. So let's address those implications from two
sides. First of all we should ask, what happens if we don't get enough
REM sleep? And a scenario that happens a lot where people don't get
enough REM sleep is the following. I'll just explain the one that I'm
familiar with 'cause it happens to me a lot, although I figured out
ways to adjust. I go to sleep around 10:30, 11:00,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1740"&gt;Irritability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fall asleep very easily and then I wake up around 3:00 or 4:00 AM. I
now know to use a NSDR, a non sleep deep rest protocol and that allows
me to fall back asleep. Even though it's called non sleep depressed
it's really allows me to relax my body and brain, and I tend to fall
back asleep and sleep till about 7:00 AM. During which time I get a
lot of REM sleep. And I know this because I've measured it, and I know
this because my dreams tend to be very intense of the sort that we
know is typical of REM sleep. In this scenario, I've gotten my slow
wave sleep early in the night and I've got my REM sleep toward
morning. However, there are times when I don't go back to sleep, maybe
I have a flight to catch, that's happened. Sometimes I've got a lot on
my mind and I don't go back to sleep. I can tell you, and you've
probably experienced that the lack of REM sleep tends to make people
emotionally irritable. It tends to make us feel as if the little
things are the big things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1800"&gt;Sleep to Delete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's very clear from laboratory studies where people have been
deprived selectively of REM sleep, that our emotionality tends to get
a little bit unhinged and we tend to catastrophize small things. We
tend to feel like the world is really daunting, we're never gonna move
forward in the ways that we want. We can't unlearn the emotional
components of whatever it is that has been happening, even if it's not
traumatic. The other thing that happens in REM sleep is a replay of
certain types of spatial information about where we were and why we
were in those places. And this maps to some beautiful data and studies
that were initiated by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT years ago.
Showing that in rodents and it turns out in other non-human primates
and in humans there's a replay of spacial information during REM
sleep, that almost precisely maps to the activity that we experienced
during the day as we move from one place to another. So here's a
common world scenario, you go to a new place, you navigate through
that city or that environment, this place doesn't have to be, you
know, at the scale of a city. It can be a new building. It could be
finding particular rooms, new social interaction. You experience that
and if it's important enough, that becomes solidified a few days later
and you won't forget it. If it's unimportant, you'll probably forget
it. During REM sleep there's a literal replay of the exact firing of
the neurons that occurred while you were navigating that same city
you're building earlier. So REM sleep seems to be involved in the
generation of this detailed spatial information. But, what is it
that's actually happening in REM sleep? So there's this uncoupling of
emotion, but most of all what's happening in REM sleep is that we're
forming a relationship with particular rules or algorithms. We're
starting to figure out based on all the experience that we had during
the day, whether or not it's important that we avoid certain people or
that we approach certain people, whether or not it's important that,
you know, when we enter a building that we go into the elevator and
turn left where the bathroom is, for instance. These general themes of
things and locations and how they fit together and that has a word
it's called meaning. During our day we're experiencing all sorts of
things. Meaning is how we each individually piece together the
relevance of one thing to the next, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=1945"&gt;Creating Meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I suddenly told you that, you know, this pen was downloading all
the information to my brain that was important to deliver this
information, you'd probably think I was a pretty strange character.
Because typically we don't think of pens as downloading information
into brains. But if I told you that I was getting information from my
computer that was allowing me to say things to you, you'd say, "Well,
that's perfectly reasonable." And that's because we have a clear and
agreed upon association with computers and information and memory, and
we don't have that same association with pens. You might say, "Well,
duh." But something in our brain needs to solidify those relationships
and make sure that the certain relationships don't exist. And it
appears that REM sleep is important for that, because when you deprive
yourself or people of REM they start seeing odd associations, they
tend to lump or batch things. I know this from my own experience of
I've ever been sleep deprived, which unfortunately happens too often
because I'm terrible with deadlines, pull an all-nighter, the word the
starts to look like it's spelled incorrectly. And the is a very simple
word to spell, but things start to look a little distorted. And we
know that if people are deprived of REM sleep for very long periods of
time, they start hallucinating. They literally start seeing
relationships and movement of objects that isn't happening. And so REM
sleep is really where we establish the emotional load, but where we
also, start discarding of all the meanings that are irrelevant. And if
you think about emotionality, a lot of over emotionality or
catastrophizing is about seeing problems everywhere. And you could
imagine why that might occur if you start linking the web of your
experience too extensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=2050"&gt;Adults Acting Like Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very important in order to have healthy, emotional, and cognitive
functioning that we have fairly narrow channels between individual
things. If we see something on the news that's very troubling, well,
then it makes sense to be very troubled. But if we're troubled by
everything and we start just saying, you know, "Everything is
bothering me and I'm feeling highly irritable and everything is just
distorting and troubling me." Chances are we are not actively removing
the meaning, the connectivity between life experiences as well as we
could and that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep. So
REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity to eliminate the
meanings that don't matter. It's not that it exacerbates the meanings
that do matter, but it eliminates the meanings that don't matter. And
that bears a striking resemblance to what happens early in
development. This isn't a discussion about early in development, but
early in development the reason a baby can't generate coordinated
movements, and the reason why children can get very emotional about
what seems like trivial events, or what adults know to be trivial
events. Like, "Oh, the ice cream shop is closed." And then the kid
just dissolves into, you know, a puddle of tears and the parents say,
"Okay, well, it'll be open again in another time." The children one of
the reasons that they can't generate coordinated movement, or place
that of the ice cream shop being closed into a larger context, is
because they have too much connectivity. And much of the maturation of
the brain and nervous system that brings us to the point of being
emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings is about
elimination of connections between things. So REM sleep seems to be
where we uncouple the potential for emotionality between various
experiences. And that brings us to the absolutely fundamental
relationship and similarity of REM sleep to some of the clinical
practices that have been designed to eliminate emotionality and help
people move through trauma and other troubling experiences, whether or
not those troubling experiences are a death in the family of a close
loved one, something terrible that happened to you or somebody else,
or, you know, an entire childhood or some event that in your mind and
body is felt as and experienced as, bad, terrible, or concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=2180"&gt;Trauma &amp;amp; REM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatment such as EMDR, eye
movement desensitization reprocessing, or ketamine treatment for
trauma. Something that recently became legal and is in fairly
widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine at
kind of a core level, bear very similar features to REM sleep. So
let's talk about EMDR first. EMDR, eye movement desensitization
reprocessing is something that was developed by a psychologist,
Francine Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=2235"&gt;EMDR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She actually was in Palo Alto. And the story goes that she was
walking, not so incidentally, in the trees and forest behind Stanford,
and she was recalling a troubling event in her own mind. So this would
be from her own life. And she realized that as she was walking, the
emotional load of that experience was not as intense or severe. She
extrapolated from that experience of walking and not feeling as
stressed about the stressful event to a practice that she put into
work in with her clients, with her patients, and that now has become
fairly widespread. It's actually one of the few behavior treatments
that are approved by the American Psychological Association for the
treatment of trauma. what she had her clients and patients do was move
their eyes from side to side while recounting some traumatic or
troubling event. Now this was of course in the clinic. And I'm
guessing that she removed the walking component and just took the eye
movement component to the clinic because while it would be nice to go
on therapy sessions with your therapist and take walks there are
certain boundaries to that such as, confidentiality. You know, if
there are a lot of people around a person might not feel as open to
discussing things, or weather barriers and things like that, you know,
if it's raining or hailing outside, it gets tough to do. Why eye
movements? Well, she never really said why eye movements. But, soon
I'll tell you why the decision to select these lateralized eye
movements for the work in the clinic was the right one. So these eye
movements, they look silly. I'll do them because that's why I'm here.
They look silly, but they basically involve sitting in a chair and
moving one's eyes from side to side, not while talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=2350"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you know, for it's... And then recounting the events. So it's
sometimes talking while moving the eyes, but usually it was moving the
eyes from side to side for 30, 60 seconds, then describing this
challenging procedure. Now as a vision scientist who also works on
stress when I first heard this, I thought it was crazy, frankly.
People would ask me about EMDR and I just thought, "That's crazy." I
went and looked up some of the theories about why EMDR might work and
there were a bunch of theories. "Oh, it mimics the eye movements
during REM sleep." That was one. It turns out that's not true and I'll
explain why. The other one was, "Oh, it synchronizes the activity on
the two sides of the brain." Well, sort of, I mean, when you look into
both sides of the binocular visual field you activate the visual
cortex. But, this whole idea of synchrony between the two sides of the
brain is something that I think modern neuroscience is starting to,
let's just say, gently or not so gently move away from. This whole
right brain, left brain business. It turns out however, that eye
movements are the sort that I just did and that Francine Shapiro took
from this walk experience and brought to her clients in the clinic,
are the sorts of eye movements that you generate whenever you're
moving through space, when you are self-generating that movement. So
not so much when you're driving a car, but certainly if you were
riding a bicycle, or you were walking or you were running, you don't
realize it but you have these reflexive subconscious eye movements
that go from side to side, and they are associated with the motor
system. So when you move forward your eyes go like this. There've been
a number of studies showing that these lateralized eye movements
helped people move through or dissociate the emotional experience of
particular traumas with those experiences, such that they could recall
those experiences after the treatment and not feel stressed about
them, or they didn't report them as traumatic any longer. Now the
success rate wasn't 100%, but they were statistically significant in a
number of studies. And yet there are still some critics of EMDR. And
frankly, for a long time I still thought, "Well, I don't know. This
just seems like kind of a hack." It just seems like kind of something
that for which we don't know the mechanism, and we can't explain, But
in the last five years, there have been no fewer than five and there's
a sixth on the way, high quality peer reviewed manuscripts published
in Journal of Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell Press Journal, Excellent
Journal, Nature Excellent Journal. These are very stringent journals
and papers showing that lateralized eye movements of the sort that I
just did, and if you're just listening to this it's just moving the
eyes from side to side with eyes open. That those eye movements but
not vertical eye movements suppress the activity of the amygdala,
which is this brain region that is involved in threat detection,
stress, anxiety, and fear. There are some forms of fear that are not
amygdala dependent, but the amygdala it's not a fear center, but it is
critical for the fear response and for the experience of anxiety. So
that's interesting. We've got a clinical tool now that indeed shows a
lot of success in a good number of people, where eye movements from
side to side are suppressing the amygdala. And the general theme is to
use those eye movements to suppress the fear response, and then to
recount or repeat the experience and over time uncouple the heavy
emotional load, the sadness, the depression, the anxiety, the fear
from whatever it was that happened that was traumatic. This is
important to understand because, you know, I'd love to be able to tell
somebody who had a traumatic experience that they would forget that
experience, but the truth is you never forget the traumatic
experience. What you do is you remove the emotional load. Eventually
it really does lose its potency. The emotional potency is alleviated.
Now EMDR I should just mention, tends to be most successful for single
event or very specific kinds of trauma that happened over and over, as
opposed to say an entire childhood or an entire divorce. It tends to
be most effective for single event kinds of things, car crashes, et
cetera, where people can really recall the events in quite a lot of
detail. So it's not for everybody and it should be done... If it's
going to be done for trauma it should be done in a clinical setting
with somebody who's certified to do this. But that bears a lot of
resemblance to REM sleep, right? This experience in our sleep where
our eyes are moving, excuse me, although in a different way, but we
don't have the chemical epinephrine in order to generate the fear
response, and yet we're remembering the event from the previous day or
days. Sometimes in REM sleep we think about things happened a long
time ago. So that's interesting. And then now there's this new
treatment, this chemical treatment with the drug ketamine, which also
bears a lot of resemblance to the sorts of things that happen in REM
sleep. Ketamine is getting a lot of attention now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=2665"&gt;Ketamine / PCP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think a lot of people just don't realize what ketamine is.
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic. It is remarkably similar to the
drug called PCP, which is certainly a hazardous drug for people to
use. Ketamine and PCP both function to disrupt the activity of a
particular receptor in the brain called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor. This is a receptor that's in the surface of
neurons or on the surface of neurons for which most of the time it's
not active, but when something very extreme happens and there's a lot
of activity in the neural pathway that impinges on that receptor, it
opens and it allows the entry of molecules, ions that trigger a
cellular process that we call long-term potentiation. And long-term
potentiation translates to a change in connectivity so that later you
don't need that intense event for the neuron to become active again.
Let me clarify a little bit of this. The NMDA receptor is gated by
intense experience. One way you could think about this is, typically I
walk in my home, I might make some food and sit down at my kitchen
table, and I don't think anything about explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=2745"&gt;Soup, Explosions, &amp;amp; NMDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But were I to come home one night, sit down to a bowl of chicken soup
and there was a massive explosion the neurons are associated with
chicken soup in my kitchen table would be active in a way that was
different than they were previously, and will be coupled to this
experience of explosions such that the next time, and perhaps every
other time that I go to sit down at the kitchen table, no matter how
rational I am about the origins of that explosion, maybe it was a gas
truck that was down the road and there's no reason to think it's there
today, but I would have the same experience. Those neurons will become
active and I'd get an increase in heart rate. I'd get an increase in
sweating, et cetera. Ketamine blocks this NMDA receptor and prevents
that crossover and the addition of meaning to the kitchen table,
kitchen soup, excuse me, chicken soup explosion experience. So how is
ketamine being used? Ketamine is being used to prevent learning of
emotions very soon after trauma. So ketamine is being stocked in a
number of different emergency rooms, where if people are brought in
quickly and, you know, these are hard to describe even but, you know,
a horrible experience of somebody seeing a loved one next to them
killed in a car accident and they were driving that car. This isn't
for everybody, certainly and you need to talk to your physician, but
ketamine is being used so they might infuse somebody with ketamine so
that their emotion it can still occur, but that the plasticity, the
change in the wiring of their brain won't allow that intense emotion
to be attached to the experience. Now immediately you can imagine the
sort of ethical implications of this, right? Because certain emotions
need to be coupled to experiences. I'm not saying that people should
be using ketamine, or shouldn't be using ketamine, certainly not
recreationally it's quite dangerous. It can be lethal and like PCP it
can cause pretty dramatic changes in perception and behavior. But in
the clinical setting the basis of ketamine assisted therapies is
really to remove emotion. And I think the way I've been hearing about
it talked about in the general public is a lot of people think it's a
little bit more like the kind of psilocybin trials or the NMDA trials,
where it's about becoming more emotional or getting in touch with a
certain experience. Ketamine is about becoming dissociative or removed
from the emotional component of experience. So now we have ketamine,
which chemically blocks plasticity and prevents the connection between
an emotion and an experience. That's a pharmacologic intervention. We
have EMDR, which is this eye movement thing that is designed to
suppress the amygdala, and it's designed to remove emotionality while
somebody recounts an experience. And we have REM sleep, where the
chemical epinephrin that allows for signaling of intense emotion and
the experience of a tense emotion in the brain and body is not
allowed. So we're starting to see a organizational logic, which is
that a certain component of our sleeping life is acting like therapy.
And that's really what REM sleep is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=2935"&gt;Self Therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we should really think about REM sleep and slow wave sleep as both
critical. Slow wave sleep for motor learning and detailed learning.
REM sleep for attaching of emotions to particular experiences. And
then for making sure that the emotions are not attached to the wrong
experiences and for unlearning emotional responses if they're too
intense or severe. And this all speaks to the great importance of
mastering one sleep, something that we talked about in episode two of
the podcast. And making sure that if life has disruptive events,
either due to travel or stress, or changes in school hours or food
schedule, something that we talked about in episodes three and four,
that one can still grab a hold and manage one sleep life. Because
fundamentally the unlearning of emotions that are troubling to us is
what allows us to move forward in life. And indeed the REM deprivation
studies show that people become hyperemotional. They start to
catastrophize. And it's no surprise therefore, that sleep disturbances
correlate with so many emotional and psychological disturbances. By
now it should just be obvious why that will be the case. In fact, the
other day I was in a discussion with a colleague of mine who's down in
Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. I've known her for two decades now from
the time she was at Oxford. And Sarah studies among other things
menopause in the brain. And she was saying that a lot of the emotional&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3030"&gt;Note About Hormones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;effects of menopause, actually are not directly related to the
hormones. There've been some really nice studies showing that the
disruptions in temperature regulation in menopause mapped to changes
in sleep regulation that then impact emotionality and an inability to
correctly adjust the circuits related to emotionality. And I encourage
you to look at her work. We'll probably have her as a guest on the
podcast at some point in the future, 'cause she's so knowledgeable
about those sorts of issues, as well as issues related to testosterone
and in people with all sorts of different chromosomal backgrounds. So
sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation of energy. It's not just
deprivation of immune function. It is deprivation of self-induced
therapy every time we go to sleep. Okay. So things like EMDR and
ketamine therapies are in-clinic therapies, but REM sleep is the one
that you're giving yourself every night when you go to sleep. Which
raises, I think, the other important question which is, how to get and
how to know if you're getting the appropriate amount of REM sleep and
slow wave sleep. So that's what we'll talk about next. So how should
one go about getting the appropriate amount&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3100"&gt;Measuring REM / SWS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep and knowing that you're getting the
right amount. Well, short of hooking yourself up to an EEG, it's gonna
be tough to get exact measurements of brain states from night to
night. Some people nowadays are using things like, the Oura Ring or a
WHOOP band, or some other device to measure the quality and depth and
duration of their sleep. And for many people those devices can be
quite useful. Some people are only gauging their sleep by way of
whether or not they feel rested, whether or not they feel like they're
learning and they're getting better or not. There are some things that
one can really do. And the first one might surprise you in light of
everything I've said, and probably everything you've heard about
sleep. There was a study done by a Harvard undergraduate, Emily
Hoagland, who was in Robert Stickgold's lab at the time. And that's
the study explored how variations in total sleep time related to
learning, as compared to total sleep time itself. And to summarize the
study, what they found was that it was more important to have a
regular amount of sleep each night as opposed to the total duration.
In other words, and what they showed was that improvements in learning
or deficits in learning were more related to whether or not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3195"&gt;Sleep Consistency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you got six hours, six hours, five hours, six hours, that was better
than if somebody got for instance, six hours, 10 hours, seven hours,
four or five hours. See you might say, "Well, that's crazy because I
thought we were just all supposed to get more sleep and there's more
REM towards morning." It turns out that forsake of learning new
information and performance on exams in particular, that's what was
measured, limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep is at
least as important and perhaps more important than just getting more
sleep overall. And I think this will bring people great relief, many
people great relief who are struggling to "get enough sleep."
Remember, a few episodes ago I talked about the difference between
fatigue and insomnia. You know, fatigue tends to be when we are tired.
Insomnia tends to lead to a sleepiness during the day when we're
falling asleep. And you don't want that, you don't want either of
those things really. But, I found it striking that the data from this
study really point to the fact that consistently getting about the
same amount of sleep is better than just getting more sleep. And I
think nowadays so many people are just aiming for more sleep, and
they're rather troubled about the fact that they're only getting five
hours, or they're only getting six hours in some cases. It may be the
case that they are sleep deprived and they need more sleep, but some
people just have a lower sleep need. And I find great relief,
personally, in the fact that consistently getting, for me, about six
hours or six and a half hours is going to be more beneficial than
constantly striving for eight or nine and finding that some nights I'm
getting five and sometimes I'm getting nine and varying around the
mean. As I recall, and I think I'm gonna get this precisely right, but
if not I know that I'm at least close. For every hour variation in
sleep regardless of whether or not it was more sleep than one
typically got, there was a 17% reduction in performance on this
particular exam type. So this is powerful. This means that we should
strive for a regular amount of sleep. And for some of us that means
falling asleep and waking up and going back to sleep. For some people
means falling asleep and waking up and not getting back to sleep. Now
ideally, you're getting the full compliment of slow wave sleep early
at night and sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep. Which brings us
to, how to get more REM sleep. Well, there are a couple of different
ways but here's how to not get more REM sleep. All right. First of
all, drink a lot of fluid right before going to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3360"&gt;Bed Wetting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why we wake up in the middle of the night to use
the bathroom is because when our bladder is full there is a neural
connection, literally a set of neurons and a nerve circuit that goes
to the brain stem that wakes us up. Actually some people that I know
and won't be mentioned, actually use this to try and adjust for their
jet lag when they're trying to stay awake. Having to urinate is one of
the most anxiety evoking experiences anyone can have. If you really
have to go to the bathroom it's very hard to fall asleep or stay
asleep. And bedwetting, which happens in kids very early on is a
failure of those circuits to mature until, you know, I think we all
assume that babies are gonna pee in their sleep, but adults aren't
supposed to do that. And the circuits take some time to develop and in
some kids they develop a little bit later than others. So having a
full bladder is one way to disrupt your sleep. You don't wanna go to
bed dehydrated, but that's one way. On the other hand there is
evidence that if you want to remember your dreams more, or remember
more of your dreams there is a tool that you can use. I don't
necessarily recommend it, which is to drink a bunch of water before
you go to sleep. And then what happens is you tend to break in and out
of REM sleep. It tends to be fractured. And with a sleep journal and
they've done these laboratory studies. Believe it or not, people will
recall more of their dreams because they're in this kind of semi-
conscious state because they're constantly waking up throughout the
night. I suggest not having a full bladder before you go to sleep.
That one's kind of an obvious one, but nonetheless. The other one is
if you recall that during REM sleep we have a shift in
neurotransmitter such that we have less serotonin, right? Just wanna
make sure I got that right. Excuse me, less serotonin. There are a lot
of supplements out there geared toward improving sleep. I've taken
some of them and I've taken many of them, if not all of them at this
point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3480"&gt;Serotonin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I could report back to you. And I think I mentioned on a previous
episode that when I take tryptophan, or anything that contains 5-HTP,
which is serotonin or a precursor to serotonin, serotonin is made from
tryptophan, I tend to fall very deeply asleep and then wake up a few
hours later. And that makes sense now based on the fact that, you just
don't want a lot of REM sleep early on. What was probably happening is
that I was getting a lot of REM sleep early on, because low levels of
serotonin are typically associated with slow wave sleep and that comes
early in the night. So for some people those supplements might work,
but be aware serotonin supplements could disrupt the timing of REM
sleep and slow wave sleep. And in my case led to waking up very
shortly after going to sleep and not being able to get back to sleep.
Now if you want to increase your slow wave sleep. That's interesting.
There are ways to do that. One of the most powerful ways to increase
slow wave sleep, the percentage of slow wave sleep,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3540"&gt;Increasing SWS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apparently without any disruption to the other components of sleep and
learning is to engage in resistance exercise. It's pretty clear that
resistance exercise triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine
pathways that lend themselves to release of growth hormone, which
happens early in the night. And resistance exercise therefore can
induce a greater percentage of slow wave sleep. It doesn't have to be
done very close to going to bed time. In fact, for some people the
exercise could be disruptive, for reasons I've talked about in
previous episodes. But resistance exercise, unlike aerobic exercise
does seem to increase the amount of slow wave sleep, which as we know
is involved in motor learning and the acquisition of fine detailed
information not general rules, or the emotional components of
experiences. For those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3590"&gt;Lucidity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and would like to increase the amount of lucid dreaming that you're
experiencing, I haven't been able to track down that device with the
red light that I described at the beginning, but there are a number of
just simple zero technology tools that one could use in principle. One
is to set a queue. The way this works is you come up with a simple
statement about something that you'd like to see, or experience later
in dreams. You can, for instance, write down, you know, something
like, I want to remember the red apple. I know it sounds silly and
trivial, and you look at that you would probably wanna write it down
on a piece of paper. You might even want to draw a red apple, and then
before you go to sleep you would look at it and then you would just go
to sleep. There are some reports that doing that for several days in a
row can lead to a situation in which you are suddenly in your dream
and you remember the red apple, and that gives you a sort of tether to
reality between the dream state and reality that allows you to
navigate and shape and kind of adjust your dreams. Lucid dreaming does
not have to be, or include the ability to alter features of the dream,
you know, to be able to control things in the dream. Sometimes it's
just the awareness that you are dreaming, but nonetheless some people
enjoy lucid dreaming. And then for people that have a lot of lucid
dreams that feel kind of overwhelmed by those, that's going to involve
trying to embrace protocols that can set the right duration of sleep.
There's a little bit of literature not a lot that shows that keeping
the total amount of sleep per night to say six hours such that you
begin sleep and end at the beginning and end of one of these ultradian
cycles, can be better than waking up in the middle of one of these
ultradian cycles. So try and find the right amount of sleep that you
need, that's right for you, and then try and get that consistently
night to night. If you're a lucid dreamer and you don't like it, then
you may want to start to make sure that you're waking up at the end of
one of these ultradian cycles. So in this case, it would be better to
wake up after six hours than after seven and if you did sleep longer
than six hours, maybe you'd wanna get to seven and a half hours.
'Cause that's gonna reflect the end of one of these 90 minute cycles,
as opposed to waking up in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3735"&gt;Booze / Weed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol. Alcohol and marijuana are well known to induce states that
are pseudo sleep like. Especially, when people fall asleep after
having consumed alcohol or THC, one of the active components of
marijuana. Alcohol, THC and most things like them, meaning things that
increase serotonin, or GABA are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep.
They're going to disrupt the depth. They're going to disrupt the
overall sequencing of more slow wave sleep early in the night and more
REM sleep later in the night. That's just the reality. There are some
things that at least, in a few studies that I could find seem to
suggest that you could increase the amount of slow wave sleep using
things like arginine, the amino acid arginine. Although, you really
wanna check. Arginine can have effects on heart, et cetera has other
effects. But, alcohol, THC, not gonna be great for sleep and depth of
sleep. You might feel like you can fall asleep faster, but the sleep
that you're accessing really isn't the kind of deep restorative sleep
that you should be getting. Now, of course, if that's what you need in
order to sleep and that's within your protocols, I've said here
before, I'm not suggesting people take anything. I'm not a medical
doctor. I'm not a cop. So I'm not trying to irregulate anyone's
behavior. I'm just telling you what the literature says. Some of you
may want to explore your dreams and meaning of dreams, et cetera. You
know, there's not a lot of hard data about how to do this, but a lot
of people report keeping a sleep journal, where a dream journal can be
very useful. So they mark when they think they fell asleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3830"&gt;Scripting Dreams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the night before, when they woke up and if they wake up in the middle
of the night, early in the morning they'll just write down what they
can recall of their dreams. And even if they recall nothing, many
people have the experience of mid morning or later afternoon that
suddenly comes to them that they had a dream about something and
writing that down. I kept a dream journal for a while. It didn't
really afford me much. I didn't really learn anything except that my
dreams were very bizarre. But, there are some things that happen in
dreams that are associated with REM sleep as compared to slow wave
sleep, which can tell you whether or not your dream likely happened in
REM sleep or slow wave sleep. And the distinguishing feature it turns
out is something called theory of mind. Theory of mind is actually an
idea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=3875"&gt;Theory of Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that was developed for the study and assessment of autism. And it was
initially that phrase, theory of mind, was brought about by Simon
Baron Cohen, who is Sacha Baron Cohen, the comedians brother. Simon
Baron Cohen is a psychologist and to some extent an neuroscientist at
Oxford. And theory of mind tests are done on children. And the theory
of mind test is some what like the following, a child is brought into
a laboratory and watches a video of a child playing with some sort of
toy. And then at the end of playing with that toy they put the toy in
a drawer and they go away, and then another child comes in and is
looking around and then the experimenter asks the child who's in the
experiment, the real child and says, "You know, what does the child
think? You know, what are they feeling?" And most children have a
particular age, five or six or older will say, "Oh, you know, he or
she is confused, they don't know where the toy is." Or, they'll say
something that implies what we call theory of mind, that they can put
their ideas and their mind into what the other child is likely to be
feeling or experiencing. That's theory of mind. And it turns out that
this is used as one of the assessments for autism, because some
children, not all, but some children that have autism or that go on to
develop autism don't have this theory of mind. They tend to fixate on
the fact that the first child put the toy in the drawer. They'll say
it's in the drawer as opposed to answering the question which is how
does the second child feel about it, or what are they experiencing? So
theory of mind is something that emerges early in life as a part of
the maturation of the circuits in the brain associated with emotional
learning and social interactions. And we experienced this in certain
dreams. So if you had a dream that you're puzzled about, or that
you're fixated on and you're thinking about, you might ask, "In that
dream was I assessing somebody else's emotion and feeling, or was I
very much in my own first person experience?" And that the tendency is
that theory of mind tends to show up most in these REM associated
dreams. Now this isn't a hard and fast rule, but chances are if you
were in a dream and you were thinking about other people who wanted to
do something to you, you were thinking about their desire to chase you
or help you, or something that was related to someone else's emotional
experience. It was probably a REM dream. That dream occurred in rapid
eye movement sleep as opposed to slow wave sleep. And that makes sense
when you think about the role of REM in emotional unlearning of
associations with particular life events. That REM is rich with all
sorts of exploration of the emotional load of being chased, or the
emotional load of having to take an exam the next day, or being late
for something. But again, if you're fixated or you can recall thinking
a lot about, or feeling a lot about what somebody else's motivations
were then chances are it was in REM and if not chances are it was in
slow wave sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=4075"&gt;Synthesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we've been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming, learning and
unlearning. And I just want to recap a few of the highlights and
important points. A lot more slow wave sleep and less REM early in the
night, more REM and less slow wave sleep later in the night. REM sleep
is associated with intense experiences without this chemical
epinephrine that allows us the anxiety or fear. And almost certainly
has an important role in uncoupling of emotion from experiences. Kind
of self-induced therapy that we go into each night. That bears
striking resemblance to things like EMDR and ketamine therapies and so
forth. Slow wave sleep is critical, however, it's critical mostly for
motor learning and the learning of specific details. So REM is kind of
emotions and general themes and meaning, and slow wave sleep, motor
learning and details. I personally find it fascinating that
consistency of sleep, meaning getting six hours every night is better
than getting ten one night, eight the next, five the next, four the
next. I find that fascinating and I think I also like it because it's
something I can control better than just trying to sleep more, which I
think I'm not alone and agreeing that that's just hard for a lot of
people to do. This episode also brings us to the conclusion of a five
episode streak where we've been focusing on sleep and transitions in
and out of sleep, non sleep depressed. We've talked about a lot of
tools, morning light, evening light, avoiding lights, blue blockers,
supplements, tools for measuring sleep duration and quality. We've
been covering a lot of themes. I like to think that by now you're
armed with a number of tools and information. Things like knowing when
your temperature minimum is, knowing when you might wanna view light
or not, when you might wanna eat or take hot showers, or God forbid a
cold shower, something that most people including me more or less
loath, but can have certain benefits. And that will allow you to shape
your sleep life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=4200"&gt;Intermittent Sleep Deprivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and get this consistent, or more or less consistent amount of sleep on
a regular basis. Nobody's perfect. In fact I have this little joke
that I sometimes tell, it's not funny. Like, most of the jokes I tell
I'm told are not funny, but, you know, there's so much excitement now
about intermittent fasting. Sometimes I think that someone should
start something on intermittent sleep deprivation, although we're
already doing that. We are all experiencing lack of sleep from time to
time. And I don't think we should catastrophize that too much. I think
that what we wanna do rather than accumulate a sleep anxiety is to...
You know, if we get a bad night's sleep, we want to adjust, we want to
get back on track and just get the consistent amount of sleep. Use
those non sleep deep rest protocols to help us relax when we're
feeling anxious, we're having trouble waking up in the middle of the
night. There are a lot of tools out there, and most of them are zero
cost. And so I hope you'll find those beneficial. If you've been
hearing Costello snoring throughout this episode. I apologize in his
behalf. As I said, in the welcome video to this podcast he's an
integral part of the podcast. A few people have said, "Hey, that noise
in the background is really disruptive." Hey, what can I say? Costello
is a ten-year-old bulldog mastiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=4270"&gt;Snoring Disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifespan on those animals is about 10 years. So I'm not trying to
make you feel guilty, but, you know, after he's gone there won't be
any snoring, although I'll probably get a different dog. So sort of a,
what were the kids say, sorry not sorry. Sorry not sorry about the
snoring and I'm sorry if it's disruptive genuinely, but he's here for
the hall. So that's what that's about. As we close out the segment on
sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=4300"&gt;New Topic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are moving into a new theme and topic for the next four to five
episodes. We are going to discuss the science and the tools related to
neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is a remarkable feature of the
nervous system. In fact, it's the defining feature of the nervous
system, which is its ability to change itself in response to
experience. That is unlike every other tissue and collection of cells
and organ in our body. It's really what makes us us as a species and
it's what makes us us as individuals, and it's really where our
potential lies. Everything that we know, everything we can do, and our
true potential in terms of what we will ever be able to know, do, say,
in life is set by the limits of neuroplasticity. So we're going to
explore learning and childhood, learning and adulthood. We're going to
discuss detailed protocols as they relate to sensory plasticity.
Learning new sensory information, versus motor plasticity or sensory
motor integration. We're going to talk about language acquisition.
We're going to be talking about emotional acquisition and breadth. As
well as, I think a topic a lot of people are gonna find fascinating
is, the relationship between plasticity set during childhood
attachment to parent or other caregiver, and how that maps onto adult
relationships. Many of you have probably heard about secure attach or
insecure attach. The A, B and C, D babies as they're called from the
classic studies of Bowlby and others. But now there's actual
neuroscience that can say which circuits were active during those
early life attachment and how those map to adult attachment styles,
challenges, and what makes us more likely to select certain partners
and styles of attachment, as well as how to change those. It's really
fascinating and I think neuroscience's time has come for
neuroplasticity. We're also gonna talk, of course, about supplements
and chemicals and machines and devices that can assist in speeding up
the plasticity process. Or believe it or not, there are some cases
where you might want to delay plasticity in order to get more depth of
learning and have that learning last longer. Something that is just
absolutely spectacular literature. So I'm very excited to move on to
that topic soon. I hope that the tools that you've acquired so far and
the knowledge that you've acquired so far is helping you with your
self evaluation and experimentation as you see fit, and is allowing
you to not just sleep better, but feel better while you're awake. And
hopefully has set the stage for you to learn better as we start to
march into the month on neuroplasticity. Many of you have asked how

you have asked about supplements and where I personally get my
supplements. I've partnered with Thorne and I get my supplements from
Thorne because, by my view they have the highest level of stringency
and precision in terms of what's in the bottle. And they also have
very high quality standards. They're partnered with the Mayo Clinic
and all the major sports organizations. If you wanna try Thorne
supplements you can go to thorne.com. So that's Thorne spelled
thorne.com/u/huberman. And if you do that you can see the formulations
that I take. And you'll also get 20% off, not just those formulations,
but anything that Thorne makes. That's thorne.com/u/huberman to get
20% off anything that they provide. Last but not least, a few people
wrote to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=4550"&gt;Corrections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with some questions/corrections about things that I said in previous
podcasts. So in keeping with my goal of making the information
accurate and clear, I just want to correct myself about a few things
that I said. One of those and I'm guessing it probably came from an
endocrinologist or somebody else that knows a lot about testicles
said, "Huberman, you mentioned that testosterone is made by the
sertoli cells of the testes, and it's not. It's made by the leydig
cells of the testes." And indeed you are correct. And so I want to
make sure that I clarify that. Testosterone is made by the leydig
cells of the testes, not by the sertoli cells. The sertoli cells make
5 alpha-reductase and aromatase, and some other enzymes involved in
conversion of testosterone into things like DHT and estrogen. So thank
you for that correction. I genuinely appreciate it. I misspoke. The
other thing I said, was at one point I said, "Typical temperature is
96.8 when I actually meant to say 98.6." So it was a dyslexic slip on
my part and I apologize. I don't know that I'm dyslexic. I know I
haven't been clinically diagnosed with dyslexia, but I swapped them,
which sometimes happens when I'm going fast. So I apologize. I'll use
this a moment to just say temperature varies a lot across the day and
night, that was a theme of previous podcasts. So we can't really talk
about average temperature anyway, but I do want to be clear that most
people think about average temperature as 98.6. I misspoke, my error
and I apologize. Thank you for joining me in this journey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFwA0QFmpQ4&amp;amp;t=4645"&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the nervous system in biology and trying to understand the
mechanisms that make us who we are and how we function in sleep and in
wakefulness. It's really an incredible landscape to consider and I
hope that you're getting a lot out of the information. As always thank
you for your interest in science. [upbeat music]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science, and
science-based tools for everyday life. [bright music] I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology, at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to
bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-
related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to
thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic
Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012,
long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,
mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with
water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and
it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as
probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot
of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain
access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic
Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that,
they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin
D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be
important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as
other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if
you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is
also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that
makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in
my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard
to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation
practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I
find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as
Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my
meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality
peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate
cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability,
etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice.
Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a
meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to
headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try
Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's
headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for
one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and
wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids
and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed
by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in
excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use
to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of
shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the
newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel
better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous
three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these
themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay
asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise,
temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes,
great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you
haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here
or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those
previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please
do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's
just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're
talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=255"&gt;The bedrock of sleep-rest cycles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we
call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in
all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our
feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the
experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been
done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant
darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people
have been in constant light for some period of time. But because
people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment
where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is
the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it
turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not
exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes
from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for
that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You
also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with
that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting
lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is
increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We
actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that
every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a
clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the
suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And
that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external
light-dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the
earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our
temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all
of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are
living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and
we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we
catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness,
we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient
light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that
we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life
demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away
from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've
heard there are night owls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=425"&gt;Night owls and morning larks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their
genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations
that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to
stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true.
That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However,
there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species.
We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body
were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night.
How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but
I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we
deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become
nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental
and physical, start to arise. I'm not going to spend much of today
talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little
bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to
scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression,
amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not
sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you
with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment.
And then let's talk about jet lag&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=502"&gt;“The perfect schedule”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag,
shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that
can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're
traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does
that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm
about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast
episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal.
You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much
light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you
want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as
little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when
you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is
enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure
that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say
before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central
nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of
the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate.
At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those
neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too
bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or
close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very
bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your
eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out
and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial
lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed
previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the
neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your
circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover,
the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless
you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area
where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be
hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like
Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some
artificial light. Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's
the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed
previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes
through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of
thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00
AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=664"&gt;The 100K Lux per morning goal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime
between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I
want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000
lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock
setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock
setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical
signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system
sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say
that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone
screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that
for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into
electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my
circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have
registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a
hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up
at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial
light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you
have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough
photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why
that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it
with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not
about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian
clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're
talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all
at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM.
So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this
quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take
a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even
bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux.
It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes
open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body
that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000,
10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much
photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before
that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of
the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me
pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter.
Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get
enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a
target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all
from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about
sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's
free if it's available outside. There is a number of different...
There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like
this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm
covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific
products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon,
they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think
by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer
or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a
cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming
through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use
for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation
first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?
So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're
going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that
light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian
dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to
achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on
scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the
time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is
because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's
the diabolical thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=915"&gt;Keeping your biological clock set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our
system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's
sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to
reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to,
as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright
light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of
people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I
went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all
that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's
the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the
sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle
room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and
overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian
clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=975"&gt;Reset your cortisol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light
early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day.
I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about
getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a
webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we
have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these
studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to
their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies
done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology.
You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current
Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two
days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they
actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be
a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people
that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms.
There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to
reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time,
eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's
episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least
100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing
across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's
painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then
once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11
you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to
shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way. In the
evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to
adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer
so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the
bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your
clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light
energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk
about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability
to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is
vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's
so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to
one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any
technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or
pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely
emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you
are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone
in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up
at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is
on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that
time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that
a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know
only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they
traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual
variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that
variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow
seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and
fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and
they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because
they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I
don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So,
this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask,
I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet
lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't
have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location,
they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and
they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a
terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this
varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no
simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag.
It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But
there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you
with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary
to what many people out there say and believe, I know that
understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand
mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a
list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those
things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand
mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your
biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of
understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where
we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised
that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can
happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer
reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will
kill you earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=1282"&gt;Jetlag, death and lifespan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you
necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up
stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and
buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to,
who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious
thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up,
I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping
pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to
talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week.
That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged
and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day,
woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time
and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be
transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't.
Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing
were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or
nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that
experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12
hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu
Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't
hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all
over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't
experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now
here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=1380"&gt;Going East versus West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting
because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling
east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of
course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time
zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to
your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour
shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects
of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we
have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a
pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the
autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and
body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns
out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to
activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous
system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and
you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later.
But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east
has a number of different features associated with it, that because
you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As
a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three
hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming
back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this
probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions
where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or
fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push
ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay
awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is
actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic
nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you
want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers,
you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues,
2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span
for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity
and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So
going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if
you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to
melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk
about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a
number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is
potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a
hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of
melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing
hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a
really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All
right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say
you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south.
So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or
you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just
north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really
moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will
experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two
elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is
simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to
your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before
we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to
just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned
this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people
not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older.
There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of
melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in
children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then
it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24
hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then
as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more
vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?
So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things
that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their
digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not
be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are
correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a
regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their
circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s.
He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the
Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year
olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if
you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to
shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=1725"&gt;The key to clock control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for
shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing
your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as
one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is
perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and
brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you
know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood
pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of
you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names,
but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature
minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could
measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour
cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that
without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before
your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature
minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average
waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake
up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or
4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your
temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure
your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find
your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a
low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will
start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your
temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak,
maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start
declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will
disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense
exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases
temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle
of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the
seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that
temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof
of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and
tissues of our body to be on the same schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=1861"&gt;Your Temperature Minimum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an
immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these
different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A
pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a
neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates.
So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can
interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme
of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some
people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a
low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum.
How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The
temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five
wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all
right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by
adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you
the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM
and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was
10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when
you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but
in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so
I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same
time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people
it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that
for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then
get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now
you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum
is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock.
Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose.
Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four
hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature
minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get
up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So
it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further.
You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the
four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to
phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep
later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much
confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this.
Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing
the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that
my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM.
Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright
light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to
go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the
subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature
minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time
our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more
than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in
the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm
going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later
the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point
not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your
temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96
point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information
won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body
temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just
after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you
want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature
minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some
people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up
late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's
talk about feeling fine. Turns out the definition of insomnia is when
you're experiencing excessive sleepiness during the day. Sleepiness
and fatigue are different, okay? So in the world of sleep medicine
fatigue is a physical exhaustion, sleepiness is falling asleep. Like
falling asleep at your desk or falling asleep during lectures, or
there seems to be something special about my lectures that makes
people want to fall asleep. So if this cures your insomnia fantastic,
however, in all seriousness, sleepiness during the day time unless
it's around your temperature peak and only lasts about 90 minutes or
so, is a sign of insomnia. It's a sign of lack of sleep. I want to be
very, very clear that if you know your temperature minimum, you can
shift your clock using light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=2190"&gt;Temperature and Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also shift your clock by engaging in exercise in the four
hours after your temperature minimum to wake up earlier on subsequent
nights, or exercise before then to delay your clock, okay? So now you
can start to see and understand the logic of the system. And we'll
talk about why this works and the underlying biology, but
understanding that temperature is the effector and understanding that
you have this low point that reflects your most sleepy point,
essentially right before waking up, and then temperature rises, you
can now start to shift that temperature according to your travel
needs. Here's one way in which you might do that. Let's say I am going
to travel to Europe, which is nine hours ahead typically, from
California. I would want to determine my temperature minimum which for
me is about 4:30 AM maybe 5:00 AM, and I would want to start getting
up at about 5:30 AM and getting some bright light exposure, presumably
from artificial sources because the sunlight isn't going to be out at
that time. Maybe even exercising as well, maybe even eating a meal at
that time if that's in your practice. You would want to start doing
that two or three days before travel. Because, once you land in or I
land in Europe, chances are just viewing the sunrise or sunset in
Europe is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock. Some
people say get sunlight in your eyes when you land but that's not
going to work because one of two things is likely to happen. With a
nine hour shift like that either I'm going to view sunlight at a time
that corresponds to the circadian dead zone, the time in which my
circadian clock can't be shifted, or I'm going to end up viewing
sunlight at a time that corresponds to the four to six hour window
before my temperature minimum. So it's going to shift me in exactly
the opposite direction that I want to go. So it can be very, very
challenging for people to adjust to jet lag. So you need to ask, am I
traveling east or am I traveling west? Am I trying to advance my clock
or delay my clock? Remember viewing light, exercise and eating in the
four to six hours before your temperature minimum will delay your
clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, and exercising, you don't have to do
all three but some combination of those in the four to six hours after
your temperature minimum will advance your clock. And this is a
powerful mechanism by which you can shift your clock anywhere from one
to three hours per day, which is remarkable. That means your
temperature minimum is going to shift out as much as three hours,
which can make it such that you can travel all the way to Europe and
in as long as you've prepared for a day or so by doing what I
described back home and then doing it when you arrive, you can
potentially accomplish the entire shift within anywhere from 24 to 36
hours. And this is really important to emphasize that once you arrive
in your new location and here I'm talking about traveling eastward,
California to Europe, once you arrive in your new location, you have
to keep track of what your temperature minimum was back home and how
it's being shifted during your trip. Now it's much easier to do than
you think. One of the unfortunate consequences of the smartphone is
that you can't do something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
that corresponds to the time back home and another one that
corresponds to the local time. Typically it updates automatically
based on wifi, etc. But if you can keep track of the time back home
then you can easily shift your clock going forward. I'm hoping this
will makes sense. I really want to emphasize that you don't have to be
precise down to the minute. Some of you may be asking, well, what
about you've got this temperature minimum and if I view light one
minute before it then I'm going to delay my clock and one minute after
it I'm going to advance my clock. It doesn't quite work like that,
okay. But it's very important to understand that light is the primary
way in which we can shift our clock. And now you should also be able
to understand things like the circadian dead zone from about 9:30,
10:00 AM all the way until six hours before your temperature minimum.
You're not going to shift your clock. Nothing that you do in that time
in terms of light viewing behavior, feeding, etc, is going to shift
your clock. And so a lot of people are landing in Europe getting
sunlight in their eyes and throwing their clock out of whack or not
shifting their clock at all. This brings me to the other thing that's
highly recommended. And I've mentioned this before, but you want to
eat on the local meal schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=2480"&gt;Eating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's in your practice to fast, fast, that's fine. But when you eat,
you want to eat within the local schedule for alertness. Okay. That
means if you arrive and everyone's eating breakfast and you can't
stomach the idea of breakfast in your new location 'cause your
appetite isn't there. That means the clock in your liver, you have a
clock in your liver, biological clock, has not caught up to the new
time zone. You can force yourself to eat if you like, or you can skip
that meal. But what you don't want to do is stay on your home meal
schedule, waking up in the middle of the night and eating. That is
really going to throw things off because a lot of the clocks in the
periphery like from the liver, the peripheral body, will send
information back to the brain and then the brain is getting really
conflicted signals. So the temperature minimum is really your anchor
point for shifting your clock best. I don't know why this information
really hasn't made it into the popular sphere, quite so much. There's
all sorts of stuff about taking things like melatonin, using binaural
beats, a lot of kind of like more sophisticated, complicated, and
potentially problematic ways of trying to shift the clock. Let's talk
about melatonin but first I just want to pause and shift gears a
little bit because I talked about traveling eastward, but we haven't
talked about traveling westward. So I want to do that now. Let's say
you're raveling from New York to California or from Europe to
California. The challenge there tends to be,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=2570"&gt;Go West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how can you stay up late enough? Now, some people are able to do this
because as I mentioned earlier, the autonomic nervous system is
asymmetrically wired such that it's easier to stay up late later than
we would naturally want to than it is to go to sleep earlier. So let's
say you land and it's 4:00 PM and you're just dying, you're in
California, you came from Europe, it's 4:00 PM and you really, really
want to go to sleep. That's where the use of things like caffeine,
exercise, and sunlight can shift you, right? If it's after your
temperature peak then viewing sunlight around 6:00 PM or 8:00 PM or
artificial light, if there isn't sunlight, will help shift you later,
right? It's going to delay your clock and you're going to be able to
stay up later. The worst thing you can do is take a nap that was
intended to last 20 minutes or an hour. I do this routinely and then
wake up four hours later or you wake up and it's midnight and you
can't fall back asleep. You really want to avoid doing that. So
provided it's not excessive amounts, stimulants like caffeine and
coffee or tea can really help you push past that afternoon barrier and
get you to sleep more like on the local schedule. And eating on the
local schedule as well. A number of people have asked about the use of
melatonin to induce sleepiness. All right, well let's think about what
melatonin is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=2655"&gt;Pineal myths and realities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is this hormone that's released from the pineal gland, which
is this gland. A couple of notes about the pineal, 'cause I've been
getting a lot of questions about this. I'm probably going to draw some
fire for this but I'd be happy to have a thoughtful, considerate
debate, with some peer reviewed papers in front of us. The pineal does
make this hallucinogenic molecule they call DMT, but in such a
minuscule amounts that it is not responsible for the hallucinations
you see in sleep and dreaming. Sorry, folks. It's also not responsible
for the hallucinations you might see through other approaches to DMT.
It's just not, that's not where the DMT comes from. It's
infinitesimally small amounts. There are a lot of kind of wacky claims
out there about calcification of the pineal and fluoride and this kind
of thing. Look, the pineal sits in an area of the brain near the
fourth ventricle, where the skull is not terribly far away although
there's some overlap in neural tissue and with age there's some
aggregation of some of the meninges and other things around there that
stick to the skull. Young brains don't look like old brains but
there's no calcification of the pineal, all right? So you can forget
about calcification of the pineal as a problem. I don't know where
that whole thing got started but that's not an issue. Your pineal will
churn out melatonin your whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness.
Melatonin during development is also responsible for timing the
secretion of certain hormones that are vitally important for puberty.
Does melatonin control the onset of puberty? Not directly, but
indirectly. Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing
hormone, which is a hormone that's released from your hypothalamus
also roughly above the roof of your mouth in your brain. Gonadotropin-
releasing hormone is really interesting 'cause it stimulates the
release of another hormone called luteinizing hormone, which in
females causes estrogen to be released within the ovaries, it's
involved in reproductive cycles, and in males stimulates testosterone
from the sertoli cells of the testes. Melatonin is inhibitory to GnRH,
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and therefore is inhibitory to LH,
luteinizing hormone, and therefore is inhibitory to testosterone and
estrogen. There's just no two ways about it. There is immense amount
of data on the fact that high levels of melatonin in seasonally
breeding animals, takes the ovaries from nice and robust ovaries that
are capable of deploying eggs and this kind of thing and literally
shrinking them and making these animals infertile. These are very high
levels of melatonin in seasonal breeders in winter. Melatonin in males
of seasonal breeders takes the testes and shrinks them. Long ago when
I was at UC, Berkeley as a master's student, I was working on
neuroendocrinology, and we were working on this hamster species of
seasonal breeders. And basically when days are long, which inhibits
melatonin, these little Siberian hamsters as they're called, have
testes about the size of, sort of typical table grapes, although
that's a weird way to put it. When days get shorter and the melatonin
signal gets longer because light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter,
melatonin gets longer. Those same hamsters would have testes that
would involute to the size of about a grain of rice. Now this does not
happen in humans in short days. But nonetheless, the melatonin signal
really does have a ton of effects on the hormone system. Now, does
that mean that if you've been taking melatonin you've really screwed
up your hormones? Not necessarily. Does it mean if a kid has been
taking melatonin that's really screwing up their puberty? Not
necessarily and here's why. Melatonin operates on a concentration
level. So in a child that's very, very small that has high levels of
melatonin, it actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone or estrogen
depending on the sex of the child. But as that child grows through
other mechanisms, like growth hormone release, etc, that same amount
of melatonin released from the pineal is now diluted over a much
larger body so that the concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? But here's the problem with supplementing melatonin. As I
mentioned in the previous episode, concentrations of melatonin in many
commercial supplements have been shown to be anywhere from 85% to 400%
of what's listed on the bottle. So when you take melatonin or a child
takes melatonin oftentimes they are taking super physiological levels
of melatonin, which at least by my read, and the literature, says that
it could have dramatic effects on timing and course of things like
puberty. So it's not so much that the journals have come out saying,
oh, taking that melatonin inhibits puberty, it's that no single study
has been done with the super physiological levels of melatonin that
are present in a lot of these supplements in developing children. So
melatonin is used widely for inducing sleepiness when you want to fall
asleep in the new location that you've arrived, right? You can't fall
asleep, you take melatonin, it helps you fall asleep. It does not help
you stay asleep. In addition to that, melatonin has been kind of
touted as the best way to shift your circadian clock. I'm happy to go
on record saying, look, if you need melatonin, you can work with a
doctor or somebody who really understands circadian and sleep biology
go for it, if that's your thing. But I, as always on this podcast and
elsewhere, I have a bias toward behavioral things that you can titrate
and control like exposure to light exercise, temperature, etc, that
have much bigger margins for safety and certainly don't have these
other endocrine effects that we've been thinking about and talking
about. So if you want to take melatonin in the afternoon in order to
fall asleep or in the evening, be my guest, that's up to you. Again,
you're responsible for your health, not me. But for many people
melatonin is not going to be the best solution. The best solution is
going to be to use light and temperature, and exercise on either side
of the temperature minimum to shift your clock both before your trip
and when you land in your new location and your clock starts to shift.
Okay, so now you know my opinions about melatonin, feel free to filter
them through your own opinions and experiences with melatonin. And now
you also understand what your temperature minimum is and how it
represents an important landmark either side of which you can use
light, temperature, and exercise to shift your clock. Just to remind
you a little bit about temperature, if you want to shift your clock,
typically you would do that by you can take a hot shower and then that
will have a cooling effect after the hot shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=3073"&gt;The Heat-Cold Paradox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you were to get into a cold shower or an ice bath if you have
access to one, afterward there's going to be a thermogenic effect of
your body increasing temperature. And if you just think about your
natural rhythm back home when everything's stable, you have an idea a
low point in which is your temperature minimum, and then you have a
peak, and you think about when you're doing this hot or cold shower in
that rhythm, now you should be able to understand how you're shifting
your rhythm. That temperature rhythm is the one that's going to move.
Give you an example. If I were to wake up in the morning and let's say
I wake up at 6:00 AM. My temperature I know is rising, I've passed my
temperature minimum. If I were to get into a hot shower, that would
then lower my body temperature when I got out, that is not normally
what's happening first thing in the morning, and therefore my clock
would very likely get phase delayed, right? It's going to delay the
increase in temperature. Whereas if I got into a cold shower,
something I don't personally like to do, but I've done from time to
time or an ice bath that's going to then have a rebound increase in
body temperature and is going to phase advance my clock. That peak in
the afternoon is going to come about an hour earlier. I'm going to
want to go to bed earlier, later that night. So you can start to play
these games with timing and hot and cold, with meals whether or not
you eat, or you don't eat, and with light exposure, whether or not you
view light or you don't view light. So now you can start to see why
understanding the core mechanics of a system can really give you the
most flexibility because I could spend the next 25 years of my life
answering every question about every nuance pattern of travel. Well,
we're going to Sydney and then we're going there, what should I do?
But that's on you. You need to figure out your temperature minimum and
your temperature peak, if you like, and then use these parameters to
it gives you flexibility. And that really underscores the most
important thing is that when you understand mechanism it's not about
being neurotically attached to a specific protocol, it's the opposite.
It gives you power to not be neurotically attached to a specific
protocol. It can give you great confidence and flexibility in being
able to shift your body rhythms however you want. And when things get
out of whack you can tuck them right back into place. One thing that's
common is that people need to do a quick trip. It's not always that
you're going to go to, you know on vacation for two weeks or, you
know, work someplace else for weeks on end. If your trip is 48 hours
or less, stay on your home schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=3225"&gt;Staying on track&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be tough and it may require scheduling meetings according to
your home schedule, but if you can somehow manage that the best thing
to do would be to stay on your home schedule. Your clock is not going
to shift more than a couple hours, even if you do everything correctly
in one day, okay? So if I were to travel, say to Europe, I've actually
done this, I did a 24 hour trip to Basel, Switzerland, gave a talk and
came back, people thought I was crazy but, I had a little bit of
travel fatigue 'cause remember there's fatigue from the actual travel
experience. The novelty of it, the air is never great on the planes,
this was even true before there were mask requirements and things like
that. There's the travel fatigue but you don't throw your clock off.
If you stay 48 hours, then you start to shift a little bit. 72, that's
when you start running into trouble. The transit time is also
important but I would say if it's three days or less, stay on your
home schedule as much as you can. And because sunlight isn't under
your control unless there's something about you I don't know, that's
when traveling with some sort of bright light like the light pad that
I have down there that I showed earlier, for those of you listening
just on audio, it sort of looks like an eight and a half by 11 inch
pad. It's actually not designed for wake up, it's actually designed,
it's a drawing pad, and it emits about 1,000 lux of light. And so if
you want to travel with something like that, you can use that in your
hotel room to wake up when you like. Some people will use night
shades, you know, not the night shades that you eat or that some
people say you're not supposed to eat, I don't know anything about
that, but the eye covers to keep light out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=3330"&gt;Nightshades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those can be very useful on planes and in hotels and so on. So you can
use light and dark or you can travel with your light and dark devices
so that you can stay on your home schedule and get most of your light
when it would be your normal wake up time back home. And what's kind
of nice is if you know when your circadian dead zone is back home,
which is generally for most people around 10:00 AM to about 3:00 PM,
so basically the rising phase of your temperature, then you can also
feel free to be outside without having to wear sunglasses or you don't
have to worry about light exposure. But if you know that window before
your temperature minimum, that four to six hour window, that's the
time when if you're viewing a lot of light in your new location, you
are going to shift your clock pretty considerably and then you can
come back home and have a terrible time. At the end of graduate
school, I went to Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, had amazing time, I came back and it was the
first time in my life where I couldn't sleep on a regular schedule. I
was sleeping in like hour long increments throughout the day, it was a
nightmare. And it took me weeks to get back on target. And the way I
was able to do that was exercising consistently at the same time every
24 hours, turning my home into essentially a cave at night, even
covering up the windows and then getting as much bright light in my
eyes as I possibly could during the day, no sunglasses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=3420"&gt;Emergency resets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it can take some real work if your clock gets thrown out of whack.
There's a phenomenon called ICU psychosis, where people that are in
the intensive care unit in hospitals actually lose their mind. They
become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. And it's because of altered
circadian cycles. We know this 'cause they're exposed to these lights
and these sounds, people coming in and checking on them. They leave
the hospital or in some cases, there have been experiments where
people are placed near a window where they get some natural light and
the psychotic symptoms disappear, presuming there weren't psychotic
symptoms beforehand, before they entered the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=3450"&gt;Psychosis by light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's pretty dramatic what light can do to the psyche and to the
body. So let's talk a little bit about a different form of jet lag
that requires no planes, no trains, no automobiles, and that's shift
work. Shift work is becoming increasingly common. Many of us are shift
working even though we don't have to. We're doing work in the middle
of the night, we are, you know, working on our computers at odd hours,
sleeping during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=3485"&gt;Shift work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people who are under shelter and place type stuff, are doing
more of this. Kids with the drifting school schedules. Here's the deal
with shift work. If there's one rule of thumb for shift work, it's
that if at all possible, you want to stay on the same schedule for at
least 14 days, including weekends. Now that should immediately cue the
non shift workers to the importance of not getting too far off track
on the weekend, even if you're not a shift worker. So sleeping in on
Sunday is not a good idea. The most important thing about shift work
is to stay consistent with your schedule. Now, I had a conversation on
an Instagram live with Samer Hattar, who's a neuroscientist at the
National Institutes of Mental Health, he's actually the head of the
chronobiology unit there. And he was really emphasizing this point
because shift work where people are doing the so-called swing shift,
where they're working four days on one shift and four days on or
another, is extremely detrimental to a number of health parameters. It
gets the cortisol release from the adrenals really out of whack. And
there're these cortisol spikes at various hours of the day, it messes
up learning, it really disrupts the dopamine system and wellbeing. It
is a serious, serious problem. So if you can negotiate with your
employer to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time, that's
going to be immensely beneficial and will help you offset a lot of the
negative effects of shift work. Now, I don't presume that all of you
are going to be able to do that. Some of you just don't have that
level of control. And of course, I want to acknowledge that shift
workers are essential, right? Of course, first responders,
firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, but also pilots, night
nurses, people working on the hospital wards, people picking up trash.
These night shifts are critical to our functioning as a society, as
I'm sure all of you can appreciate. If you're going to work a shift
where let's say, you start at 4:00 PM and you end at 2:00 AM, excuse
me, then there's some important questions that arise. For instance,
should you see light during your shift? Well, this is a matter of
personal choice but ideally you want to view as much light as possible
and as is safely possible when you need to be alert. So that would
mean from 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM and then you would want to sleep. So
using light as a correlate of alertness and using darkness as a
correlate of sleepiness, what this means is see as much light as you
safely can during the phase of your day when you want to be awake. So
it's the same thing I said way back at the beginning of this podcast
episode. And see as little light as safely possible and it allows you
to function during the time when you want to be asleep. So if you're
finishing out that 2:00 AM shift, that's when you would want to avoid
bright light exposure, you'd want to go home, you'd really want to
avoid watching TV if possible. If you need that in order to fall
asleep, that would be a case where something like dimming the screen,
plus blue blockers, if that's in your practice or you want to do that
would be helpful and then going to sleep and then you'll probably wake
up late in the afternoon or early afternoon. Some of you might say,
wait, Huberman, I thought you don't like blue blockers. I never said I
don't like blue blockers. I don't like people wearing blue blockers at
the time of day when they want to be alert. And I don't like people
asserting that blue blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply
because people are wearing them. The brightness of light is what's
important it's not about the blue. So if you want to wear them, wear
them, or just dim the lights or turn the lights off. So let's say you
go to sleep at, you get home after this 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM shift, you
maybe eat something, you go to sleep, and you wake up and it's noon or
1:00 PM. Should you get light in your eyes? Well, your first
assumption based on what I've said previously might be that you're in
the circadian dead zone that you can't because it's noon 1:00 PM. But
you're not in the circadian dead zone because you're somebody who goes
to sleep early in the morning at 2:00 AM. So it's not like the
circadian dead zone is a strict time of day, it's an internal
biological clock. So what do you need to know? You guessed it, you
need to know your temperature minimum. You need to know whether not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=3760"&gt;The Temperature-Light Rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your temperature is increasing or decreasing. And now we can make this
whole thing even simpler and just say, if your temperature is
decreasing, avoid light. If your temperature is increasing, get light.
It's that simple, okay? If your temperature is decreasing, avoid
light, if your temperature is increasing, get light. The shift worker
who works from 4:00 PM until 2:00 AM has a temperature rhythm that's
very different than mine where I wake up around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, and
I go to sleep around 11:00 PM, okay? We both have a 24 hour-ish
circadian cycle, except mine is more aligned to the rise and setting
of the sun and there's is not, right? So you have to know your
internal temperature rhythm. And no you don't have to walk around with
a thermometer wherever, taking your temperature. Although it'd be
great if some of the devices that are out there, you know, people are
counting their steps, I think it'd be great if people had a circadian
body temperature measurement. I'm not involved in any of this device
development but I think it's a real call to arms, pun intended, to
have a wristband that would measure temperature and would tell you
your temperature minimum when you travel or whatnot. I don't know,
maybe some of these devices already do that. But if they don't, they
should. It's absolutely absurd to me why we wouldn't have the simple
measurement, very easy to get that kind of information. You don't even
need the exact temperature read all you need to know is the high and
low point. So let's say you're a shift worker who really is nocturnal,
you're flipped. Well, you want to stay on that nocturnal schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=3860"&gt;Up all night: watch the sunrise?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that can be very hard on families and social life of all kinds.
But the person who is working say from, you know, 8:00 PM, like
sundown to sunrise, this raises a question. Should they be looking at
the sunrise and should they be watching the sunset? Waking up with a
sunset, going asleep at the sunrise. You think, well, is that light
going to throw them off? Ah, probably not. It's just actually going to
invert what sunrise and sunset are. When they're waking up in the
morning, if they look at the, you know, they get some sunlight in
their eyes, they look at the sun and get some bright light from
devices or overhead lights in their apartment or home, well, that's
going to tend to wake them up if it's in the evening, right? So it's,
you know I don't know if I stated that clearly, but if in the evening
the sun is setting and they're looking at that setting sun, that is
the morning sun for that person and it will wake them up for their
night shift. So temperature rising. Then toward morning, what's
happening? Okay, well, they're closing out their work shift. You're
going home, the sun is rising. Do you look at the rising sun? Well,
based on what you now know your eyes are very sensitive to resetting
of circadian clocks. What will it do at that time? If this were a
classroom, I would either cold call on somebody or I'd wait for the
oh, oh, oh, oh person in the audience that inevitably exists. So
temperature is for that person, they've been up for a while,
temperature is falling, not rising. For me it will be rising. But
'cause I'm diurnal, I'm awake during the day. For that person the
temperature's falling and so they view light while temperature is
falling. What's it going to do? It's going to phase delay them. It's
going to make it harder for them to get to sleep the following night.
So you would say that person should watch the setting sun to help them
wake up 'cause they're going to work the night shift, but should
probably have sunglasses on or avoid viewing bright light before they
go to sleep. So it's the same thing. They're just on an inverted as a
typical person who's diurnal, but they're on an inverted schedule. And
so I'm really trying hard here to make this all really clear. There
are kind of two patterns of requests in the world I'm noticing as I've
kind of ventured into the this landscape of social media and podcasts.
There are people who want to know every detail and want to quantify
everything 'cause they want to get exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=4005"&gt;Error correction is good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are like the graduate students and students that don't want to
make a mistake. And to quote my graduate advisor, provided the
mistakes are not dangerous, certainly not lethal, you kind of want to
make a few little mistakes so that you can adjust, right? You don't
want to endanger yourself. But it's actually, you're not going to get
things perfect, that's called learning. Learning is when you realize,
ah, I viewed the sun this time and then I stayed up and it really
messed me up, I'll never do that again. The other category of people
seem to want the one size fits all kind of like give me this pill or
give me this protocol. And those things generally work but they don't
afford people flexibility. And if there's anything like that, it's
this temperature minimum thing that I've been just hammering on again
and again and again today because it's something that you own and that
you can really use as a key landmark for shifting your clock. I
suppose there's a third category, which is, people accept that
biological systems are actually much more forgiving than the way
they're sometimes described. And I'm going to use this as an
opportunity to editorialize a little bit. You know, there's so much
made of sleep debt. Look there isn't an IRS equivalent for sleep.
They're not going to come around and try and collect all the sleep
that you didn't get. No one really knows what the consequences are
going to be for you and for me and for the next person for the sleep
you didn't get. You can't really recover the sleep you missed out on,
but you also don't want to get neurotically attached to a schedule
because there's this thing called sleep anxiety and then people have
trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=4100"&gt;NSDR protocols/implementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want to spend a moment on that and go back to a theme that I've
said many times before, because these tools work what I called NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest. So this would be hypnosis, I gave you the link,
but I'll say it again, reveriehealth.com for clinically tested,
research tested free hypnosis for anxiety but also for sleep. Those
are very beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest
protocols for things like yoga nidra, I provided some links to those
in the caption for episode two. These things really work. Last night,
I woke up, I went to bed about 10:30, I woke up at three in the
morning, I knew I wasn't feeling rested. I did a NSDR protocol, I fell
back asleep, I woke up at 6:30, okay. You need to teach your brain and
your nervous system how to turn off your thoughts and go to sleep. And
ideally you do that without medication unless there's a real need, you
do that through these behavioral protocols. They work because they
involve using the body to shift the mind not trying to just turn off
your thoughts in the middle of the night. Now there are periods of
life where things are stressful and people are concerned and you will
have some struggle getting and staying asleep. And there's, that
really has to do more with anxiety which NSDR protocols also can help
with. As I always say, do them in the middle of the night if you wake
up and you want to go back to sleep during the middle of the day, to
teach your nervous system to calm down and do them first thing in the
morning if you didn't feel you got enough sleep. In other words, do
them whenever you have an opportunity to do them because they really
can help you learn how to turn on the parasympathetic/calming arm of
your autonomic nervous system. There's no other way that I'm aware of
to teach your system to slow down and turn off your thoughts and go
back to sleep. But these are powerful protocols, and there's a lot of
research now to support the fact that they can really help. Meditation
would be another example. Certain kinds of meditation involve focus
and alertness. Those are slightly different than meditations that
involve lack of focus and attention to say internal states. I'm going
to pause there, and then I want to talk about kids and the elderly. In
other words, how do we control sleep and circadian rhythms and
wakefulness in babies, adolescents, teens, and aged folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=4244"&gt;The frog skin in your eye (not a joke)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, before we talk about sleep in kids, I want to tell a little
story. It's not a joke, many of you will be relieved that I'm not
going to try and tell another joke this episode. Which is the
relationship between light, skin and pelage color, dopamine and
reproduction, mating. So many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian
hamsters which I mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, other animals,
change their color of their coat. In the winter they tend to be a
lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes with flecks of black or
brown. And in the summer their pelage changes to a color of you know,
brown or red, some other vastly different color. That shift is
controlled by light and by melatonin. This has an interesting
correlate in humans. So humans obviously have different skin tones
just genetically because of the amount of melanin in one skin,
depending on genetic background. But of course sunlight will increase
the amount of melanin in the skin regardless, right? This is suntan,
sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. The whole system is wired so that
shifts in skin color and shifts in these cells within the eye and
melatonin are actually very closely linked. So here's the story. Many
years ago, meaning about 10 years ago, 15 years ago, let's see it was
20 years ago, forgive me. A guy named Iggy Provencio who was running
his own lab at uniformed armed services, this is a standard biological
laboratory, discovered that there was an opsin in the eye in the cells
of the eye that connect to the rest of the brain called melanopsin.
Melanopsin, as many of you now know is the opsin, it's like a pigment,
it absorbs light. It is the opsin that converts light into electrical
signals to then set the circadian clock. Iggy discovered melanopsin
because it was similar in form to what was in frog melanophores. It
was actually in the skin of frogs that allowed those frogs to go from
pale white, when it was dark, for most of the 24 hour cycle, to
pigmented green or brown for a frog. So there's this relationship
between the cells in our eye and the pigment cells of our skin. And we
also know that in long days, there's more breeding. How does that
work? Well that's actually from dopamine triggering increases in
testosterone, mainly in males, and estrogen mainly in females although
of course, there's testosterone estrogen in both sexes. So we have
this kind of pathway where it's light, increases in the melanin,
dopamine and reproduction on the one hand and lack of light,
melatonin, decreases in the darkness of skin, less melanin in the
skin, or in the case of an animal with fur, white fur and no
reproduction on the other hand. And humans don't actually shift their
breeding patterns tremendously from long days and short days, although
there are some data that there's some shifts. We also don't radically
change our skin color depending on how much sunlight exposure we have.
But the simple way to put this is, when days are long, there's a lot
more dopamine and we feel really good and there's a lot more breeding
and breeding-like behavior. When days are short, there's a lot less
dopamine and a lot less breeding behavior because these pathways are
very highly conserved. Now what's interesting is that, as we've moved
into a modern society where much of our waking days we are looking at
screens, which is fine, 'cause we're getting a lot of light that way
although not as much as sunlight. But also at night, we're getting a
lot of light from screens. What's happened is all these path ways,
melanin in the skin, turnover of skin cells, dopamine, all of this
stuff has become completely disrupted. Now that's not to say that we
should go back to a time in which we didn't use artificial lights. But
I think the important thing to realize is that feeling good with
getting a lot of light, the relationship to dopamine and melanin in
the skin, and the good feelings of getting light also on our skin
provided you're not getting burned or you're not getting excessive UV
exposure, those are not just coincidences. Those are hard-wired
biological mechanisms that exist in everybody regardless of how light
or dark your skin is to begin with. There's another point, which is
important, which is that the dopamine system which is this feel-good
molecule is very closely related to the testosterone and estrogen in
reproductive cycles. Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-
releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, and the production of these
hormones, and melatonin is the effector. It is the hormone of
darkness. So, I just threw a lot of biology at you. And I'm not saying
you're like a Siberian hamster, at least not in ways that I'm aware
of. I'm not saying that your pelage color is going to change. Actually
the reason people go gray is because when you're really stressed, did
you know this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=4599"&gt;Why stress turns your hair white&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that when you're really stressed, there's an increase in the nerve
fibers that release adrenaline to the hair follicle and that activates
peroxide groups in the hair follicle that cause the hair to actually
go gray or white. So actually stress does make your hair gray or
white. Aging does it too. That was a brief aside, but for those of you
that are interested in the relationship between light and skin tone
and all that kind of stuff, I thought you might find it interesting
that the cells in your eye are a lot like these skin cells in frogs or
in animals that shift their entire color and sometimes metamorphosize.
You know, there are some species that literally change shape in their
reproductive organs. In fact, if that wasn't weird enough,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=4644"&gt;Ovaries or testes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I was in graduate school at Berkeley, there was another graduate
student studying a species of hermaphroditic mole, right, those little
things that dig, hermaphrodite mole that would change from having
ovaries to testes and back again depending on day life. Super cool,
super different, and wild biological mechanism. If you're wondering
how those animals reproduce they actually adjust the numbers of males
and females depending on the density of males and females. So if there
are too many males, some of the males turn their testes into ovaries.
And if there're too many females, they turn their ovaries into testes.
They actually are true hermaphroditic animals as opposed to as pseudo
hermaphrodite animals. Okay, let's get back on track. Let's talk about
the animal that most of you care about which is the human animal. New
parents and babies. All right, as I mentioned earlier, melatonin is
not cyclic, it's not cycling in babies, it's more phasic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=4705"&gt;Babies and bright light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's being released at a kind of a constant level. And babies tend to
be smaller than adults, they are. And so those concentrations of
melatonin are very high. As the baby grows, those concentrations per
unit volume are going to go down. Babies are not born with a typical
sleep wake cycle. And now all the parents are saying, tell me
something I didn't know. They also have, and I really want to
emphasize this, they also have much more sensitive optics of the eye.
So a number of people have asked me, you know, should I be exposing my
baby to sunlight? You don't want to avoid sunlight, but their eyes are
very sensitive, the optics of their eyes aren't quite developed so
much so that you know when you look at a newborn baby and they look a
little glassy-eyed and they're kind of looking through you or even a
young child. A lot of people think that they're seeing you the way
that you're seeing them. Hate to break it to you, but if you ever can
just google visual image of a like a one month old. The optics of
their eyes are so poor that you're a cloudy image. They're not seeing
your fine detail. As the optics get better, then they will see you
with more and more clarity. But a lot of that is clearing of the lens
and some of the other aqueous features of the newborn eye, they don't
see very well. But they also don't have such great ways of adjusting
to bright light. And so babies have a natural aversion to bright
lights. So you really want to avoid trying to use sunlight or really
bright light in the same way that you would for an adult on a young
baby or child. As children get older however, melatonin does start to
become slightly more cyclic, slightly more cycled, and their body
temperature rhythms also start to fall into a more regular, not quite
24 hour rhythm, they're more of these ultradian rhythms. So in
episode, I think it was one or two of the podcast, or maybe both, we
talked about these 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, where every
90 minutes babies are going through a cycle of body temperature and
some other hormonal features. I mean, so much is changing in their
system. So what to do if a child isn't sleeping? You can use phases of
darkness and phases of light but they're going to have to be shortened
in order to try and encourage sleep when you want the child to sleep.
It's not that they're just not going to fall into an adult-like regime
of a temperature minimum and a temperature maximum. Their temperature
minimums and maximums are fluctuating much more quickly. And it varies
tremendously. Actually there's an interesting literature of whether or
not they have siblings, whether or not they're twins, whether or not
they're in a nursery environment, whether or not they're alone,
hopefully the baby's not alone, but you know what I mean, that they're
sleeping alone in a room while you're in the other room. There are a
couple of things that seem to help which is getting the overall
environment into a 24 hour schedule. So having the room slightly
colder, obviously you want babies to be nice and cozy, slightly colder
when you would like them to be asleep, slightly warmer for the times
you would like them to be awake. Babies tend to run pretty hot anyway.
And obviously you want to be very careful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=4900"&gt;Polyphasic sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about avoiding all extremes of temperature, cold or hot. So if they're
going through these 90 minute cycles, you're going to have to adjust
to those 90 minute cycles as well. So then people say, well, that's
not going to help me at all because how do I deal with the fact that I
need to be up every 90 minutes at night? There are a couple tools that
can be helpful. The first one is going to be to try and understand the
relationship between calm and deep sleep. So the autonomic nervous
system can put us into states of panic, where that's kind of seesaw of
autonomic alertness, goes all the way to panic. Or it can be
alertness, or it can be alert and calm, right? So there's a range
there, it's a continuum. It can also be that you're in deep sleep, so
the other end of the seesaw is way up or you're your in light sleep or
you're kind of sleepy, or you're just feeling kind of relaxed. Perhaps
the most important thing if you're having to map to a baby schedule in
order to make sure that they're getting changings, and nursing, etc,
at the appropriate times, is to try and maintain, if you can't sleep
or you can't sleep continuously, to try and maintain your autonomic
nervous system in a place where you're not going into heightened
states of alertness when you would ideally be sleeping. Now, I realize
that this could be translated to try and stay calm while you're sleep
deprived, which is very hard for people to do. But this is where the
non-sleep deep rest protocols surface again and can potentially be
very beneficial for people to be able to recover, not necessarily
sleep, but for them to maintain a certain amount of autonomic
regulation. So what would this look like? This would look like, the
baby goes down, maybe it's only going to go down for 45 minutes. If
you can capture sleep, capture sleep. There are some data showing
what's called polyphasic sleep. If you can sleep in 45 minute
increments or batches, even if it's spread throughout the day with
periods of wakefulness in between, as miserable as that sound, there
are actually some adults that have deliberately employed that, who
don't have children for the sake of work productivity. And it does
tend to reduce the total overall amount of sleep that you need. It is
a very hard schedule for most people to maintain but if you have a
baby, the baby may be throwing you into that kind of schedule anyway.
So if you can get 45 minutes sleep while they sleep, great. If you can
get another 45 minutes after waking and then they go back down to
sleep, great. So as many phases of sleep as you can get. But if you
can't sleep the data on non-sleep deep rest type protocols does show
that at least from a neurochemical level, I want to be clear what that
means, reset of things like dopamine levels in the basal ganglia
measured by things like positron emission tomography, etc. Those
things tend to reset themselves pretty well if you can access these
deep rest state. So that means not being alert throughout the entire
time that the baby is sleeping. Trying to sort of mirror the baby's
sleep cycle which can be brutal for certain people, and especially if
you're trying to prepare meals and do all these things. So I do
recognize that there are a lot of constraints on parenting not just
mapping on your baby's sleep schedule. As children approach ages one,
two, three, four, that's when certainly the optics of the eyes have
improved but you don't want to damage the eyes of course, with very
bright light. They are much more sensitive even until they're kind of
10, 11 years old. And we'll talk about vision in children in a moment.
But trying to get longer and longer batches of sleep through,
hopefully not through the use of administering melatonin to the kids
'cause that's what I talked about before why that could potentially be
detrimental talk about that with your doctor. But more so trying to
get longer blocks of sleep that map onto these ultradian cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=5125"&gt;Ultradian cycles in children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it would be better off to get a three hour, like two-90 minute
cycles, than a four hour batch of sleep because waking up in the
middle of those ultradian cycles can just be brutal for parent and
kid. So if one can't get a full six or 10, or some kids should even be
sleeping 12 hours when they're growing quickly, trying to get batches
of sleep even if they're fractured throughout the 24 hour cycle that
are matched more to these 90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one
ultradian cycle of 90 minutes, or two back to back, or three back to
back to back. That's going to be better than waking up in the middle
of an ultradian cycle. It's just going to set any number of other
things in a better direction than were you to try to say, just enforce
or force a full eight or 10 hours of sleep. That's at least what the
literature shows. Some kids sleep great through the night, starting at
a very young age, others don't. I typically hear from people who are
struggling tremendously, they're losing their mind understandably,
because they're not sleeping, their kid's not sleeping and, or their
kid is sleeping for such brief periods. So in other words, try and
access deep calm if you can't sleep, try and access sleep, if you can
sleep even if it's fractured. And then you say, well, what about all
the sunlight viewing and the exercise stuff? When sleep is really,
really dismantled, meaning it's happening in various times of day or
night, that's especially, at those times it's going to be especially
important for the parent to get morning and evening sunlight because
your circadian clock is going into a tailspin and it basically wants
to anchor to something. So you want to give it two anchors, morning
and evening light. Okay, so this is rather different than what I
described for shift work, this is when things are really chaotic and
you're just not able to sleep. Similar circumstances can arise if
you're taking care of a very sick loved one, you're up all night. Try
and stay calm using NSDR protocols, I know it's harder to do than to
say, but those protocols are there, they're free, there's research to
support them. Try and get sleep whenever you can but also try to get
morning sunlight and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can and if
you can't get that, use artificial light, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=5258"&gt;Teens and puberty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about later life? So kids now, adolescents, teens, it is true
that teens have a tendency to wake up later and go to sleep later. In
part, just because they're sleeping a lot more. They're churning out
gonadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone. Their whole
bodies are changing. I don't know whether or not people realize this,
but the fastest rate of aging that any of us will ever undergo is
puberty. That is the fastest rate of aging. And so there's a huge
number of biological processes that are happening during puberty,
probably devote a whole episode to puberty as a fascinating aspect to
the life course but it is accelerated period of aging. And the
circadian clock mechanisms sometimes are very intact, and sometimes
they're a little dismantled and going through some change, but
prioritize the duration of sleep for adolescents and teens. Now, if
that means they're sleeping until 2:00 PM, and then waking up and then
they're up all night, the up all night part can become a problem
especially with all the devices, texting in their rooms or playing
video games. Morning and evening sunlight would be ideal but some kids
are just going to sleep through the morning sunlight. However, if you
were to measure their temperature, what you would find is that their
temperature minimum would come later in the morning. It's not going to
be 8:00 AM. It's going to be maybe even 10:00 AM, if they're sleeping
until 11 or 12. Or it might be 8:00 AM if they're sleeping until 10.
Remember temperature minimum is two hours before your average waking
time, typically. So in teens, it maximizes the total amount of sleep.
Try and get regular sunlight either in the morning or in the evening
or both. But if they're sleeping through the morning sunrise, that's
probably not as much of an issue, waking them up and depriving them of
sleep is probably worse because their T-min, their temperature
minimum, is actually falling later. So their circadian dead zone is
later, etc. So I think with adolescents and teens it makes sense to
kind of give them a little bit more rope in terms of allowing them
some leeway to adjust their own schedule. Some schools are even
starting classes later on the basis of some very good biology to
support this late shifted rhythm and this extended sleep phase. There
are data from Dr. Jamie Zeitzer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=5390"&gt;Light before waking for better sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and others at
Stanford, showing that turning on the lights in the room of a teen
before they wake up helps them get more sleep the subsequent night, it
also tricks them into going to sleep a little bit earlier. But it
gives them about 45 minutes more of deep sleep. And that's been shown
statistically, total sleep time increases as well. If they're hiding
under the covers, that's not going to work, but their eyes don't have
to be open. I know a few parents now that are coming in with a
flashlight and flashing their kids over their eyelids before they wake
up in hopes of getting this to work, some have told me this is
working. That's not part of a standard study. But it does seem to work
because, now you should know why, because if light's getting through
the eyelids, and it's say 8:00 AM and the kid is still asleep and
they're going to wake up at 10, you're giving them light just after or
around their temperature minimum, which is going to make them want to
go to sleep earlier. And in the case of teens, for some reason we
don't quite understand, sleep longer, about 45 minutes longer, spend
more time in deep sleep. Adults can do this too, if you can persuade
someone or put your lights on timer for lights to go on before you
wake up, that's really going to help you wake up earlier, okay. So if
you're starting to hear some themes are really resounding over and
over again, that should be reassuring to you, right. That these are
core mechanisms. Fortunately, there aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now in the elderly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=5480"&gt;Older people and cicadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there's a real tendency to want to go to sleep very early and wake up
very early. And people should talk to their physician. There is some
evidence that melatonin levels and patterns of melatonin secretion can
become a little chaotic in elderly folks. What do I mean by elderly?
Well, it's going to differ. Rates of aging differ, right? You see some
65 year olds that are struggling to move and seem much older than some
65 year olds that are, you know, still hustling around and have tons
of energy. There's a lot of variation, some of it's genetic, some of
it's lifestyle factors, you know, it really varies. Certainly
lifestyle factors can play an important role in rates of aging. I
think that the most prominent results from sleep and circadian rhythms
in the elderly are they need to get as much natural light, even if
it's through windows. I realize that some elderly folks can't get
outside as easily. It's not safe for them to do it, they can't move
around as easily. Exercise can come in various forms for people that
can't get outside and get a ton of sunlight by jogging or cycling. If
they're not able to do that, light through window in that case, open
window ideally, but for temperature reasons, etc, sometimes the window
has to be closed. Getting people near that window and away from
artificial light early in the day, and away from artificial lights
during the night phase can have a tremendous effect. And in the
elderly that's when melatonin might be a viable option. And this
should be discussed with a physician, of course, but you know, you're
way past the puberty time point. In most cases, people who are in
their 70s, and 80s, and 90s, are not churning out a lot of GnRH and
luteinizing hormone to begin with. And that's where struggles with
falling asleep and staying asleep, all the same parameters and things
we've described before still apply, light, exercise, temperature, etc,
but that's where melatonin might be of greatest benefit. And again,
I'm not pushing melatonin here but I think for elderly folks who are
having trouble falling and staying asleep, that might be worthwhile.
There are, and I should just also mention that regular schedule for
folks that are elderly and as much natural light as safely possible,
those are going to be the key levers for adjusting sleep in circadian
schedules. I've mentioned before in previous podcasts, other
supplements besides melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=5628"&gt;Sleepy Supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some of those supplements are quite good for sleep. You know, I'm
not a supplement pusher, I am somebody who takes supplements, I
believe in them, some have worked for me some have not worked as well,
but I certainly believe in getting the behaviors right. Whether or not
it's NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths, or
cold showers, or what have you, behavioral protocols first. There are
some supplements that I've mentioned in previous podcasts but I've
seemed to get a lot of questions about. So I just want to take a
couple minutes and just talk about some of the supplements that can be
beneficial for helping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep,
and even being able to compact your sleep schedule into a shorter
period of hours, meaning getting by well with less sleep. People take
a lot of sleeping pills. I'm not going to tell people not to take
sleeping pills. They can be very problematic, habit-forming, high
side-effect incidents in many cases, some people can handle them just
fine. Again, I'm no physician, I'm not prescribing anything. I'm a
professor, so I profess a lot of things some of which are my opinion.
Although, if you look at the scientific literature, there are some
impressive data around some non-prescription drug type supplements
that have fairly high safety margins that you might consider but you
should talk to your doctor always before adding or taking anything out
of your health regimes, right? Your health is not my responsibility,
it's your responsibility, so be a stringent filter. Along those lines,
one of the most powerful and useful tools that I've mentioned here on
many times and I plan to mention many many more times, is the website
examine.com which I have no affiliation with but is a wonderful site
that links you to quality peer reviewed studies relating to just about
any supplement including some safety warnings. Will also tell you what
subjects, whether or not it was rats, cats, elderly folks or kids,
that a given study was done on, which is important, can be kind of
hard to pull from sites where people are just advertising supplements,
right? They usually don't tell you what the study was and who were
these rats, who were these kids, etc. There are three supplements that
at least for me have had a tremendously positive effect on my sleep
that some of you might consider. I would say, if you're doing
everything properly behaviorally and you're still having issues, then
supplements might be a good thing for you. Or if you are traveling and
you want a little bit of extra help in buffering your sleep
wakefulness protocols. Some people like to go just to the supplements.
They're like, what should I take? I have people in my life that are
like, just tell me what to take, you know. I'm more of, here's what
you might want to do or not do and then think about what you might
want to take or not take. But personal preference and it's a free
country, so you can do what you like. Magnesium. So magnesium has been
shown to increase the depth of sleep and has been shown to decrease
the amount of time that it takes to access sleep, to fall asleep. It
comes in various forms. I've talked a bunch of times about magnesium
threonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate. which seems to be the more
bioavailable form of magnesium. And magnesium threonate it seems is
shadowed preferentially to the brain which is where you want it. And
there's certain transporters, it actually engages the GABA pathway
which tends to turn off certain areas of the forebrain and allows you
to kind of fall asleep. There is a study, if you'd like to explore it
since people serious about supplementation might want to explore the
study, which is Ates et al, A-T-E-S Dose-Dependent Absorption Profile
of Different Magnesium Compounds. Looks to me like a quality peer
reviewed paper. I can put the link in the caption, and it explores all
the different forms of magnesium. It does seem like magnesium
glycinate can be similar to magnesium threonate in terms of which
tissues it is shadow to. Magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E, is
preferentially shadow to the muscle, it appears, as opposed to the
brain. So it's going to be more of a muscle repair type thing or
restoring magnesium stores in the periphery as opposed to the brain.
Magnesium citrate has another name that I won't mention ingest,
because magnesium citrate's main effect, at least on me and the people
I know, seems to be a laxative effect as opposed to a cognitive
effect. There's also some evidence that magnesium threonate can be
neuroprotective. Those data come from quality labs, mostly rodent
studies, not human studies, but it's kind of interesting. And again,
the safety margins for these things tend to be pretty high, but
anytime you're going to take something new you should approach it with
caution, especially since magnesium could be involved in heart rhythm
and things of that sort. The other supplement that has been very
beneficial for me is theanine. So this is T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,
T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E. Theanine activates certain GABA pathways which are
involved in turning off top-down processing and thinking, making it
easier to fall asleep. And theanine, 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams
has a calming effect. Theanine is now showing up in a number of
different energy drinks and even some coffees as a way to try and get
people to ingest more of a given type of coffee 'cause the idea is it
will take away the jitters and the anxiety, allowing people to drink
more coffee. I'm talking about taking magnesium and theanine 30 to 60
minutes before bedtime not during the day to quell anxiety, but rather
30 to 60 minutes before bedtime with or without food, for me hasn't
made a difference. And the combination of those two things has really
helped. Theanine for sleepwalkers can be a problem. It does increase
the intensity of your dreams, it gives you very vivid dreams. So for
sleep walkers or people that get night terrors stay away from theanine
is my advice. Magnesium theanine might be something to explore for
those of you that don't have those issues. With the emphasis on might.
And then I've talked about a compound, and last time I talked about
the mechanisms of apigenin which is a derivative of chamomile, A-P-I-
G-E-N, which acts as a little bit of a hypnotic by activating chloride
channels, hyperpolarized neurons, increases GABA in the brain,
basically makes you feel a little sleepy. And chamomile, for those of
you that read your what was it that Peter Rabbits snuck into Mr.
McGregor's garden, ate the chamomile, fell asleep, Mr. Gregory came
back. Okay, anyone flashing back to elementary school? Okay. There's a
story about chamomile having these kind of sedative-like effects,
apigenin is highly concentrated chamomile also has intra-estrogenic
effects. So if you want to keep your estrogen up you might want to be
cautious about apigenin. That's where things like examine.com become
really useful because you can go to examine you put in apigenin, and
it'll tell you all the things that it does and all the things that it
does can sometimes include things that you had no idea, like reducing
conversion of certain androgens to estrogens which you might like or
you might want to avoid. That's up to you and where you want your
estrogen levels depending on who you are and what your life
circumstances and goals are. A few other things that can help the
transition to sleep, are things like 5-HTP L-tryptophan. I've talked
about why I'm not a fan of those for me, they tend to throw me into
deep sleep and then I wake up and I can't fall back asleep. So I don't
like to tinker with my serotonin system, I don't like to tinker with
my dopamine system, for entirely other reasons but none of which are
particularly concerning it's just that I find that if I increase my
dopamine by taking L-Tyrosine in pill form, then I crash really hard
the next day. Or if I take 5-HTP L-tryptophan I fall deeply asleep and
then I wake up. But I didn't mention that there might be ways to make
sleep more compact. And so this is actually a request to you. I had a
really interesting experience when I was a postdoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=6120"&gt;Red Pills &amp;amp; Acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for the first time to an acupuncturist. I know there're varying
thoughts and opinions out there about acupuncture. I can't say that
I've benefit so much from the acupuncture. There are now quality peer
reviewed studies showing publishing neuron, Cell Press journal,
excellent journal, showing that acupuncture can stimulate some anti-
inflammatory compounds depending on where the acupuncture is done.
These are really good studies, came out last year. I talked about this
on Instagram, I may talk about it again. As well as certain
acupuncture sites that increase inflammation. So, you know, you can
get different types of effects, you can't just say acupuncture is
great across the board. And I'm assuming that the acupuncturist know
which sites are good for increasing inflammation, which ones are good
for decreasing inflammation. However, this acupuncturist that I went
to gave me these red pills. He said, these are minerals for sleep, and
it was remarkable. I took the red pills. Isn't that a thing now? Take
the red pill. I don't know what that means, right, 'cause I'm not
tuned in. But these red pills looked like little M&amp;amp;Ms, I took a
couple of them on his suggestion and I fell deeply asleep and four
hours later woke up feeling incredibly rested, more rested than I had
ever felt in my entire life and I never required more than four hours
sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist moved away, I never figured out
what was in those red pills. I didn't get a chance to do the mass
spectroscopy, and I still wonder, he said they were minerals. So
somebody out there knows what these red pills are and what this
compound is. And it was incredible, and I would love to know what
those are. So if you know, please don't go taking red pills at random
to try and recreate this non-experiment experience of mine. But please
do contact me if you find out or if you're an acupuncturist and you
know what these mysterious red pills were, because they were pretty
awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=6230"&gt;Highlights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I've thrown a tremendous amount of information at you. I
hope you will figure out your temperature minimum and start working
with that to access the sleep and wakeful cycles that you want to
access. I hope that you will explore NSDR. You might want to explore
supplementation if that's your thing. You have now access to a lot of
mechanism about sleep and wakefulness. But in keeping with the theme
of this podcast, where we stay on topic for an entire month or even
slightly more, we are not done with sleep and wakefulness. I know this
is very different than the typical podcast format, where one week it's
how to become superhuman and the next week it's how to, you know,
develop growth mindset and it's kind of all over the place with
episode to episode. We are staying on track because I really believe
that as we drill deeper and deeper into these mechanisms, and you
start hearing some of the same themes again and again, you're going to
start to develop an intuition and an understanding of how these
systems work in you and your particular life circumstances. And my
goal is really to eventually become obsolete. It's what my graduate
advisor used to call the hit by a bus principle. She had a somewhat
morbid sense of humor and used to be, well, if I get hit by a bus
tomorrow, what are you going to do without me blabbing at you here? So
I don't want to get hit by a bus, I plan on living a very long time,
if I have anything to say about it. But were I to get hit by a bus
tomorrow, what would you do for your sleep and wakefulness, right? You
could put a comment on YouTube, which I hope you will do. But if I
were hit by a bus and killed then I wouldn't be able to answer your
question. So know your temperature minimum, understand light in the
early part of the day is valuable. Light when you want to be awake,
provided it's not so bright it's damaging. It's great for you whether
or not it comes from screens or sunlight but sunlight's better. Avoid
light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum or else
you're going to delay your clock unless you're traveling and that's
what you want to do. Okay? Use temperature, increase temperature to
shift your clock, decrease temperature to delay your clock, okay? Map
out your temperature and understand it. You don't have to know degree
by degree across the day, know your minimum, know your maximum
temperature in your 24 hour cycle and you'll feel great power through
that because then you'll know also about these ultradian cycles, these
90 minute cycles within which you can do focused work. Don't expect
the focus to come early, expect focus to come in the middle and then
kind of taper off. I talked a little bit about kids, a little bit
about elderly, about parenting, we are going to continue, there's
going to be more. But now shift workers, travelers, people that are
jet lagging themselves at home, you now have levers in place.
Information can be powerful but you have to implement it in ways,
obviously safe ways and reasonable ways. But implementing this
knowledge in the ways that you trust are safe and reasonable for you
is going to be the way that you can develop a bit of a laboratory
about yourself. I loath the term biohacking, sorry, biohackers. I
don't believe in hacking anything. I believe in understanding
mechanism and applying the principles of mechanism for which there are
large bodies of quality peer reviewed data, and even a whole center of
mass around certain biological principles, like the effects of light
and temperature, temperature minimums, that will allow you to shift
your biology in the ways that you want it to go. That will allow you
to shift your psychology in the ways you want to go. Next podcast
episode, we are going to talk more about a few things. First of all,
we're going to answer more of your questions 'cause during office
hours, I didn't get to all your questions from the previous episode.
So I do read the comments and we're paying attention and figuring out
the most common questions. We are going to get to some of the harder
topics. Someone came at me, it's always fun when somebody does this,
they said, well, these are just the kind of basal low-level questions.
What about the big stuff? What about dreaming and lucid dreaming and
consciousness? Look, I'll talk about that stuff. And I'm planning to
do that, some of which in the next episode and the following episode
maybe even. But I want to give you data. I want to give you things
that are supported by data. So I will try to speculate as little as
possible because this is a podcast about science and science-based
tools for everyday life. This is not about me speculating. Many people
have speculated about the role of sleep, dreaming and consciousness.
Fascinating topics, and a rather circular argument frankly, it's been
going on for centuries. Someday we'll get there, right now we're
concentrating on these deep biological mechanisms that make you who
you are and allow you to feel certain ways, good or bad, allow you to
function physically in certain ways, good or bad, and give you more of
a sense of control. That's my goal here. Many people have quite
graciously asked how they can help support the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAATB55oxeQ&amp;amp;t=6510"&gt;Feedback and Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, thank you, we appreciate the question. You can support
the podcast by subscribing to the podcast on YouTube, as well as
subscribing on Apple or Spotify. And you can also leave us comments
and feedback on YouTube and at Apple that really helps. We would hope
the feedback would be positive, but nonetheless, leave us feedback,
ask questions, we will use those questions to create future content
for the podcast. As well, if you can recommend the podcast to friends
and family and other people that you think might find the information
of use, that's terrific. And check out our sponsors that we mentioned
at the beginning. That's a really great way to help support us and our
ability to bring you this information. Along those lines, a lot of
people have asked me about supplements and supplement companies. So up
until now I've been reluctant to recommend specific supplement brands.
The supplement industry is kind of a wild west of different brands,
different levels of quality and stringency. It can be very complicated
and what's on the bottle is not always what you're getting. The
quality of what you're getting varies from company to company, and
even from substance to substance, batch to batch. So I'm pleased to
say that I'm partnering with Thorne, Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E, is a
supplement company that works with the Mayo Clinic, and with pretty
much all the major sports team organizations and that I know to have
the highest levels of stringency in terms of what's in the bottle
matches what's listed on the bottle, and in terms of the quality of
what they put in those supplements. So, while I mentioned earlier,
that supplements aren't for everybody. If you're interested in trying
some of these supplements you might want to check out Thorne. If you
want to do that you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman. So it's t-h-o-r-
n-e.com, c-o-m slash the letter u slash huberman, and if you do that,
they'll give you 20% off any of the supplements that you happen to
purchase from Thorne. Thanks so much for your time and attention. I
really appreciate it. See you next time on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
And as always, thanks for your interest in science. [bright music]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[upbeat music] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss
science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew
Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and
effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want
to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is
Athletic Greens, which is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic
liquid supplement. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012 because
I really like getting my total vitamin mineral base covered in one
easy to consume product. It also tastes really good. I mix mine with a
little bit of lemon juice. I've been doing that well over a decade
now. And the inclusion of probiotics is important to me because
there's a lot of data out there right now about the importance of gut
health for the immune system for, mood. And so by combining all these
things in one product you get all those things at once. If you want to
try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and
that will give you a special offer where you will get a year supply of
liquid vitamin D3 and K2 vitamin D3 has been shown to be important for
various aspects of immune function as well as other biological
functions. And so once more, if you want to try athletic greens and
get the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 just go to
athletigreens.com/huberman. The other sponsor of today's podcast is
InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a way to measure metabolic factors,
hormones, and DNA related factors by way of blood tests and saliva in
order to assess one's health. I'm a big believer in blood tests and
saliva tests for assessing one's health markers, because I like data.
And there's really no other way to measure what's going on in one's
body without taking the occasional blood test or saliva test. You can
guess what's going on but if you really want to know what's going on
under the hood InsideTracker can be of great help. One of the problems
with a lot of products out there or just regular blood testing is that
you get a lot of data back about the levels of various hormones,
metabolic factors, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with those
data. Great thing about InsideTracker is provided in a format. They
have an online dashboard that given your particular levels of various
things directs you toward potential lifestyle related changes like
changes in exercise, or changes in sleep patterns, or changes in
nutritional patterns, that can really help move those markers and
those numbers on those metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera in the
direction that you want. If you'd like to try InsideTracker you can go
to insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll 25% off
their program at checkout. Okay, let's get started. Today is episode
three of the podcast and it is office hours. Office hours as many of
you know, it's where students come to the office of the professor, sit
down and ask questions, requesting clarification about things that
were confusing, or to simply go down the route of exploring a topic
with more depth and detail. I asked for your questions to be listed in
the comment section of the previous two episodes of the podcast on
YouTube, as well as on Instagram. And I first of all just want to
thank you for the many questions, they are excellent. We read them
all. We distilled from that large batch of questions to two types of
questions. Questions that were asked very often and were light very
often with a little thumbs up like tab as well as questions that we
thought could really expand on the topics that we've covered
previously. And today we're going to cover both of those. If we did
not get to your question, please don't despair. We will keep track of
those. And we have several more episodes devoted to this topic of
sleep and wakefulness and learning during the month of January, maybe
even, leaking over a little bit into the month of February. So, we
have time that's one of the unique formats of this podcast is that we
have time for dialogue, we have time for your questions and we have
time to really go deep into these topics. It's official Costello is
sleeping in the background. So if you hear snoring, Costello is going
to be keeping time with his deep and melodic snoring. There he goes.
So the questions that we received, I batched crudely into a couple of
different categories, light, exercise, supplementation, temperature,
learning, plasticity, and mood, and sort of mood related disorders.
There were a lot of questions about those. Before we begin any of this
I want to point out something that I, I always say it sounds like
boiler plate but it's important not just to protect me but to protect
you, which is that I am not a physician. I'm not a medical doctor. I
don't prescribe anything, including behavioral protocols. I'm a
professor. So I profess a lot of things based on quality peer reviewed
studies. You should take that information. You should filter it
through whatever it is that you currently happen to be dealing with,
whether or not that's health or illness, you should consult with a
licensed healthcare professional before you add or remove anything
from your daily life protocol. I'm not responsible for your health.
You are, so be smart with this information and be a stringent filter,
as we say. Okay, very well let's get started on the actual material.
Somebody asked, what is the role of moonlight and fire,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=350"&gt;Moonlight &amp;amp; Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm presuming they mean fireplace or candle or things of that sort, in
circadian rhythms. Is it okay to view moonlight at night or will that
wake me up? Will a fire in my fireplace or using candle light be too
much light. Great question, also offers me the opportunity to share
with you what I think is a quite beautiful definition of what light is
in a quantitative sense. So I've mentioned a few times the use of apps
and light meters and things to measure things like locks, which
sometimes are also described in terms of Kendals. So those are the two
units for measuring light intensity. Typically lux, L-U-X is the, is
the unit. And so before we go forward and discuss this many lux or
that many lux, I want to just tell you what a lux is because it
relates to this question. One lux equals the illumination of one
square meter surface at one meter away from a single candle. Think
about that. So somebody actually decided at some point that the amount
of illumination at one square meter surface, one meter away from a
single candle, that equals one lux. So when we talk about 6,000 lux of
light intensity or 10,000 lux of light intensity, now you have a kind
of a reference or a framework that would be the equivalent of, you
could think of it as 6,000 candles all with their light intensity
shown on one square meter from one meters distance away. Or of course,
if it was a different number of lux it would be a different number of
candles. So you get the idea. Here's the great thing. It turns out
that moonlight, candle light, and even a fireplace, if you have one of
these roaring fires going in the fireplace, do not reset your
circadian clock at night and trick your brain into thinking that it's
morning even though if you've ever sat close to a fireplace or even a
candle, that light seems very bright. And there are two reasons for
that that are very important. The first one is that these neurons in
your eye that I discussed in the previous episode these melanopsin
ganglion cells also called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion
cells. Those cells adjust their sensitivity across the day, and those
cells respond best to the blue-yellow contrast present in the rising
and setting sun, so-called low solar angle sun, also discussed in the
previous episode, but those cells adjust their sensitivity such that
they will not activate the triggers in the brain that conveyed daytime
signals when they view moonlight, even a full moon a really bright
moon or fire. Now this does raise an interesting kind of thought
point, which is, you know, a lot of people talked about lunacy and the
fact that when there's a full moon out people act differently and
behave differently. There's a lot of lore around that. There's
actually a little bit of quality science around that that maybe we can
address in the future. But, moonlight is typically not going to wake
us up too much, except maybe the moon is really full and really
bright, there's possibility for that. So, providing you're not going
to burn down the structure you're in, you're not going to burn down
the forest, enjoy your, your fireplaces, enjoy your lights from
candles. And those are perfectly safe without disrupting your
circadian rhythm. Because we talked about just how crucial it is to
avoid bright lights between the hours of about 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.
Except when you need to view things for sake of safety or work or so
and so forth. I also received a lot of questions about red light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=565"&gt;Red Light: Good &amp;amp; Bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I think I was asked those questions because red light is used in
a number of different commercial products where these products tend to
include a sheet, of very bright red lights. That one is supposed to
view early in the day. And there are various claims attached to these
red light devices that they improve mitochondrial function, that they
improve metabolism there I'm going to be really honest and I can't
name brands, and I'm not going to name particular studies. 'Cause what
I'm about to say about these studies is not particularly unkind but
let's just say that none of the studies that I've seen except for one
that I'll talk about in a moment, pointing to the positive effects of
red light on the visual system are published in blue ribbon journals.
They tend to be published in journals that I had to work hard to find.
I'm not sure what the peer review and stringency level is. Now, that's
not to say red light isn't beneficial because there is one study in
particular that came from Glen Jeffrey's Lab at the University of
College, London it was published last year. Glen is somebody I happen
to know is an excellent reputation, excellent vision scientist, what
this study essentially showed. And again, this is a study that I very
much liked the data and think it was done with very high standards.
What this study shows is that, viewing red light for a few minutes
each morning can have positive effects on mitochondria in a particular
retinal cell type, that tends to degenerate or decline in function
with age in humans. And that cell type is the photoreceptor. The
photoreceptor is a type of cell in your eye that sits at the back of
the eye. It's kind of some distance away from the ganglion cells. And
it's the cell that converts light information into electrical signals
that the rest of the retina and brain can understand. These are
vitally important cells without them, people are blind. And many
people's vision gets worse with age. In particular, age related
macular degeneration but also related to some other factors including
photo receptor functionality just getting worse with time. And what
Glen showed was that red light flashes delivered in particular early
in the day but not late in the day can help repair the mitochondria.
Now this study needs more support from additional studies of course.
They are doing a clinical trial. They did report on what I think it
was 12 patients. And so the work is ongoing, but that was very
interesting. And it points to some potentially really useful things
about red light. However, most of the questions I got about red light
for sake of office hours were about the use of red light later in the
day. So here's the deal, in principle red light will not stimulate the
melanopsin retinal neurons that wake up the brain and circadian clock
and signal daytime. However, most of the red lights in particular the
red lights that come on these sheets of these products that people are
supposed to view them in order to access a number of proclaimed health
effects, those are way too bright and would definitely wake up your
body and brain. So if you're going to use those products and I'm not
suggesting you do, or you don't, but if that's your thing, you would
want to use those early in the day. Who knows you might even derive
some benefit on mitochondria function in these photo receptors. But if
you're thinking about red light for sake of avoiding the negative
effects of light later in the day and at night, then you want that red
light to be very, very dim, certainly much dimmer than is on most of
those commercial products. Now, do you need red lights? No. Although
red lights are rather convenient because you can see pretty well with
them on, but if they're dim, they won't wake up the circadian clock.
They won't have this dopamine disrupting thing that we talked about in
the previous podcast. So there's a role for red light potentially
early in the day and for mitochondrial repair in the photoreceptors,
there's a role for dim red light later in the day and at night. So
you're starting to notice a theme here which is that, there's no
immediate prescription of look at these light, it's look at these
lights potentially if that's what you want to do at particular times
of day and we're particular intensities. It brings us back to the blue
light issue which is so many people are obsessed with avoiding blue
light, but you actually want a ton of blue light early in the day and
throughout the day. So don't wear your blue blockers then or maybe
even don't wear them at all. And at night, it doesn't matter if you
have blue blockers on if the lights are bright enough, then you're
still going to be activating these cells and mechanisms. I just want
to add something about the science behind the blue blocker confusion.
So these melanopsin retinal cells do react to blue light. That that is
the best stimulus for one of these melanopsin cells, which led to the
belief that blue blockers would be a good thing for preventing
resetting of the circadian clock at night and deleterious effects of
screens, et cetera. However, the people that made these products fail
to actually read the papers from start to finish or if they did, they
didn't comprehend a critical element which is that most of those
papers early on took those neurons out and put them in a dish. And
when they did that, they divorced those neurons from their natural
connections in the eye. It turns out in your IMI right now, because
that's what we care about, these cells exist and the cells respond to
blue light but also to other wavelengths of light because they not
only respond directly to light as they do in a dish, they also respond
to input from photo receptors. So if you talk to anyone in the
circadian biology field, they'll tell you, "Oh, yeah this blue light
thing, has really gotten out of control." Because people assume that
blue light is the culprit because blue light is the best stimulus.
That doesn't mean that blue light is the only stimulus that will
trigger these cells, okay? So like many things a scientific paper can
be accurate without being exhaustive. And a lot of claims about
products can be accurate, but not exhaustive. So blue light during the
day is great. Get that screen light, get that sunlight especially
getting overhead lights. I'll talk about all this in the previous
podcast, but at night you really want to avoid those bright lights.
And it doesn't matter if it's blue light or something else. And so
there was a real confusion about the papers and the data when most of
those product recommendations were made. Okay. While we're on that
topic, let's talk about light in other orifices of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=945"&gt;Why Blue-Blockers Are Unscientific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a kind of a joke about this, the last podcast episode but a
couple of people wrote to me and said, well, I've seen some claims
that light delivered to the ears into the ears or the roof of the
mouth or up the nose can be beneficial for some setting circadian
rhythms, no. Not directly anyway. And this is a great opportunity for
us to distinguish between what is commonly called the placebo effect
but a more important way to think about any manipulation behavioral or
otherwise that you might do is the difference between modulation and
mediation. There are a lot of things that will modulate your biology.
Putting a couple of lights up your nose, please don't do this. Might
modulate your biology by way of the stress hormone that's released
when you stuffed those things up your nose. Remember earlier a
previous podcast, I said that virtually anything we'll face shifts
your circadian rhythm if it's different and dramatic enough. So the
question is, is it the light delivered up the nose or through the ears
or some other orifice that's mediating the process? Is it actually
tapping into the natural biology of the system that you're trying to
manipulate? And this is where I like to distinguish between real
biology and hacks. I don't like the word hack or frankly neuro hacking
or bio hacking. I just don't like the term because a hack is is using
something for a purpose for which it was not intended, right? But
where you can kind of, it's kind of a cheat and that's not how biology
works well. So I try and distinguish between things that really
mediate biological processes and things that Modulate them. There are
a number of commercial products out there with some studies attached
to them, claiming that light delivered to the ears or wherever can
adjust your wakefulness or adjust your sleep. I've looked at those
papers again, I'm probably going to lose some friends by saying this
but maybe I'll gain a few as well. Not blue ribbon journals, frankly,
oftentimes read the small print. There was a conflict of interest
clause there related to commercial interests. If somebody disagrees
with me outright on this and can send to me a peer reviewed paper,
published in a quality journal about light delivered anywhere, but the
eyes of humans that can mediate circadian, rhythms, wakefulness et
cetera, I'm more than happy to take a look at that and change my words
and stance on this and do it publicly, of course. But until then I'm
guessing that the proper controls were not done of adjusting for heat
that could be delivered which can definitely shift circadian rhythms.
We're going to talk about temperature and other things like that. So
light to the eyes folks is where these light effects work in humans,
in other animals, they have extra ocular photo reception in humans,
no. And just be mindful, I mean, I'm not trying to encourage people to
avoid certain products in particular but just be mindful of this
difference between modulation and mediation. A mediating, a process
through a hard wired or long-standing biological mechanism is really
where you're going to see the powerful effects over time. I also, as
you've probably noticed, I really tend to favor behavioral tools and
zero cost tools first, and getting those dialed in before you start,
plugging in and swallowing and putting things in various places just
to really figure out how your biology works and explore that, unless
there's of course a clinical need to take a prescribed drug in which
case, by all means, listen to your doctor. Okay, a huge number of
people asked me about what about light through windows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=1160"&gt;Eyeglasses, Contact Lenses &amp;amp; Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I actually did an Instagram post about this look, setting your
circadian clock with sunlight coming through a window is going to take
50 to 100 times longer. If you want the date on that, I'd be happy to
send you to the various papers that were described in the previous
podcast that Jamie Zeitzer from Stanford. And I have discussed also
elsewhere but here's really the key thing with us. Do the experiment.
You can download the free app Light Meter. You can have a bright day
outside or some sunlight hold up that app, take a picture. It'll tell
you how many lux now, you know what lux are. It will tell you how many
lux are in that environment. Now close the window. And if you want
close the screen or don't open the screen you can do all sorts of
experiments. You'll see that it will at least half the amount of lux.
And it doesn't scale linearly. Meaning let's say I get a 10,000 lux
outside, 5,000 looking out through an open window and then I closed
the window and it's 2,500 lux. It does not mean that you just need to
view that sunlight for twice as long if it's half as many lux, okay?
It's not like 2,500 lux means you need to look for 10 minutes and
5,000 lux means you look for five minutes. It doesn't scale that way
just because the biology doesn't work that way. Best thing to do is to
get outside, if you can, if you can't next best thing to do is to keep
that window open. It is perfectly fine to wear prescription lenses and
contacts. Why is it okay to wear prescription lenses and contacts,
when those are glass also, but looking through a window, diminishes
the effect. Well, we should think about this. The lenses that you wear
in front of your eyes by prescription or on your eyes are designed to
focus the light on to your neural retina. In fact, that's what near-
sightedness is, is when the image because your lens doesn't work quite
right. The image falls in front of the neural retina, wearing a
particular lens in front of that focuses the lens onto your retina
onto these very neurons. So they can communicate that to the brain.
It's Costello is loving this light. He's deep in sleep. And if we,
maybe we could play him some tones and he'll remember it later, based
on the studies, we're going to talk about in a little bit. I don't
know how we'd know if he remembered it or not, but prescription lenses
are fine. In fact, they're great for this reason they're actually
focusing the light onto the retina. So think about this logically and
all of a sudden it makes perfect sense your glass window or your
windshield or the side window of your car, it isn't optically perfect
to bring the image and the light onto your retina. In fact, what it's
doing is it's scattering and filtering light in particular the
wavelengths of light that you want. So, if you live in a low light
environment lots of questions about this. We talked about this, the
previous podcast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=1325"&gt;Adding Up Your Lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but just get outside for longer or, and/or use really bright lights
inside. Okay, so let's think about why I'm making some of these
recommendations because I think it can really empower you with the
ability to change your behavior in terms of light viewing and other
things, depending on time of year, depending on other lifestyle
factors. The important point to understand is that early in the day,
your central circadian clocks and all these mechanisms are looking for
a lot of light. I mean, they don't have a mind of their own, but it
needs a lot of light to trigger this daytime signal, alertness et
cetera. And early in the day, but not in the middle of the day, you
can sum or add photons. So there's this brief period of time early in
the day, when the sun is low in the sky when your brain and body are
expecting a morning wake up signal where let's say, it's not that
bright outside. Someone sent me a picture or a little movie of their
walk in England, and it was pretty overcast and they were using light
meter and they said it's only about 700 lux or maybe even less. And I
said, well, stay outside longer. But when you get inside, turn on the
lights really bright and overhead lights in particular, because those
will be best for stimulating these mechanisms. And that's because at
least for the first few hours of the day, you can continue to some or
add photon activation of the cells in the eye and the brain. In the
middle of the day, once the sun is overhead, or even if you stay
inside all morning, and then you're in the circadian dead zone, which
sounds terrible and it is terrible. You doesn't matter if you get a
ton of artificial light or even sunlight, you're not going to shift
your circadian clock. You're not going to get that wake up signal. And
then in the evening, you want to think about this whole system as
being vulnerable to even a few photons of light because of their
sensitivity to light really goes up at night. And I talked last time
about how you can protect against that sensitivity by looking at the
setting sun and watching the evening sun, even if it's not crossing
the horizon around the time of sunset. And that's because it adjusts
your retinal sensitivity and your melatonin pathway so that light is
not as detrimental to melatonin at night. Think about the afternoon
sunlight viewing as kind of a, I think of it as kind of a Netflix
inoculation. It allows me to watch a little bit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=1470"&gt;“Netflix Inoculation” With Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of Netflix in the evening, although it's very hard to watch a little
bit of anything on Netflix. It seems like there's some other neuro-
biological process that going on there where I have to watch episode
after episode after episode. But in any case, you can protect yourself
against some of that bad effect of light at night by looking at light
in the evening. It really does adjust down the sensitivity of the
system. Okay. I want to talk about seasonal changes in all these
things as they relate to mood and metabolism. So depending on where
you are in the world, Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere at the
equator or closer to the poles, the days and nights are going to be
different lengths. That just makes sense. But that translates to real
biological signals that impact everything from wakefulness and sleep
times but also mood and metabolism. So here's how this works. Now,
after seeing the previous episode of the podcast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=1525"&gt;How The Planet Controls Your Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and paying attention here, you are armed with the knowledge to really
understand how it is that believe it or not, every cell in your body
is tuned to the movement of the planet relative to the sun. So as all
of you know, the earth spins once every 24 hours on its axis. So part
of that day were bathed in sunlight depending on where we are the
other half of the day or part of the day we're in darkness. The earth
also travels around the sun 365 days is the time that it takes, one
year, to travel around that sun. The earth is tilted. It's not
perfectly upright. So the earth is tilted on its axis. So depending on
where we are in that 365 day journey and depending on where we are in
terms of hemisphere, Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere, some
days of the year are longer than others. Some are very short, some are
very long. If you're at the, at the equator you experience less
variation in day length and therefore nightlife. And if you're closer
to the poles, you're going to experience some very long days. And
you're also going to experience some very short days depending on
which poll you're at and what time of year it is. The simple way to
put this as depending on time of year the days are either getting
shorter or getting longer. Now, every cell in your body adjusts its
biology according to day length, except your brain, body and cells
don't actually know anything about day length. It only knows night
length. And here's how it works. Light inhibits melatonin powerfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=1620"&gt;A Season For Breeding (?)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If days are long and getting longer, that means melatonin is reduced.
The total amount of melatonin is less because light is more, therefore
melatonin is less. If days are getting shorter, light can't inhibit
melatonin as much, through the summing of photon mechanisms that we
talked about before, and that melatonin signal is getting longer. So
every cell in your body actually knows external day length and
therefore time of year by way of the duration of the melatonin signal.
And in general, it's fair to say that in diurnal animals, meaning
animals like us that tend to be awake during the daytime and not
nocturnal animals, which tend to be awake at night. The longer the
melatonin signal, the more depressed not necessarily clinically
depressed, although that can happen but the more depressed our systems
tend to be. Reproduction, metabolism, mood, turnover rates of skin
cells and hair cells all tend to be diminished compared to the spring
and summer months for some Northern hemisphere, spring and summer
months, or the times in which days are very long. And there's less
melatonin that tends to, in almost all animals, including humans, more
breeding, more hormone elevation of the hormones that stimulate
breeding reproduction and fertility metabolism is up, lipid metabolism
fat-burning is up, protein synthesis is up. These things tend to
correlate with the seasons. Now, some people are very, very strongly
tied to the seasons. They get depressed, clinically depressed in
winter and light therapies are very useful for those people. Some
people love the winter and they're happiest in winter and they feel
kind of depressed in summer. Although that is far more rare. That
doesn't mean depression cannot exist in the summer, but when we're
talking about seasonal depression that tends to be true. It's more
depression in winter. Now there's other things that correlate with
seasonality. Suicide rates tend to be highest in the spring not in the
winter, but that has to do with some of the more complicated and
unfortunately tragic aspects of suicide which is that oftentimes
people will commit suicide not at the very depths of their energy
levels, but as they're emerging from those depths of low energy. So
we'll talk about suicidality and mood disorders in a later podcast
season, meaning a month later. But for now, just understand that
everybody is going through these natural fluctuations depending on the
duration of the melatonin signal. Now this might lead you to say,
"Well, then I should just really get as much light as I can all the
time and reduce melatonin feel great all the time." Unfortunately,
doesn't work that way because melatonin also has important effects on
the immune system. It has important effects on transmitter systems in
the brain, et cetera. So everybody needs to figure out for themselves
how much light they need early in the day and how much light they need
to avoid late in the day, in order to optimize their mood and
metabolism. There is no one size fits all prescription because there's
a range of melatonin receptors, there are a range of everything from
metabolic types to genetic histories, family histories, et cetera.
There is no one size fits all prescription but by understanding that
light and extended day length inhibit melatonin and melatonin tends to
be associated with a more depressed or reduced functioning of these
kinds of activity driving and mood elevating signals, and
understanding that you have some control over melatonin by way of
light, including sunlight but also artificial light, and that should
empower you I believe, to make the adjustments that if you're feeling
low you might ask, how much light am I getting? What am I getting that
light? Because sleep is also important for restoring mood, right? So
you need sleep. You can't just, just crush melatonin across the board
and expect to feel good because then you're not going to fall asleep
and stay asleep. Melatonin, not incidentally comes from, is
synthesized from serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=1875"&gt;Melatonin / Serotonin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is associated with feelings of
well-being provided to proper levels, but well-being of a particular
kind. Well-being associated with quiescence and calm and the feeling
that we have enough resources in our immediate kind of conditions. Is
the kind of thing that comes from a good meal or sitting down with
friends or holding a loved one, or conversing with somebody that you
really bond with. Serotonin does not stimulate action. It tends to
stimulate stillness. Very different than the neuromodulator dopamine
which is a reward feel good neuromodulator that stimulates action. And
actually dopamine is the cursor to epinephrin, to adrenaline which
actually puts us into action. There it's actually made from dopamine,
right? So, you can start to think how about light as a signal that is
very powerful for modulating things like sleep and wakefulness but
also serotonin levels, melatonin levels. And I talked about this
previously but I'll mention once more, that light in the middle of the
night reduces dopamine levels to the point where it can start causing
problems with learning and memory and mood. That's one powerful reason
to void bright light in the middle of the night. Okay. Seasonal
rhythms have a number of effects but humans are not purely seasonal
breeders. Unlike a lot of animals, we breed all year long. In fact,
there's a preponderance of September babies in my life, not actual
babies, because they're born in September which means that they were
conceived in December, without knowing the details we can fairly
assume that. And December, at least in the Northern hemisphere at days
tend to be shorter and nights tend to be longer. So clearly humans
aren't seasonal breeders but there are shifts in breeding and
fertility that exist in humans, but also much more strongly in other
animals. So seasonal effects vary. Some of you will experience very
strong seasonal effects others of you will not. I think everybody
should be taking care to get adequate sunlight and to avoid bright
light at night throughout the year if possible. Throughout this
podcast and in previous episodes, I've been mentioning
neuromodulators, things like serotonin and dopamine which tend to buy
a certain brain circuits and things in our body to happen in certain
brain circuits and things in our body not to happen. One of the ones
I've mentioned numerous times is epinephrin which is a neuromodulator
that tends to put us into action, make us want to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=2030"&gt;Epinephrine vs Adrenaline: Same? Different?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when it's released in high amounts in our brain and body, it
can lead to what we call stress or the feeling of being stressed.
Several people ask me, what's the difference between epinephrin and
adrenaline. Adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands which sit
right above our kidneys. Epinephrin is the exact same molecule except
that it's released within the brain. And so people use these phrases
or these words rather interchangeably, epi means near or on top of
sometimes and neph, neph Anytime you see nephron or ph it means
kidney. So it means near the kidney. So epinephrin actually means near
the kidney. So it was used originally to describe adrenaline, but
epinephrin and adrenaline are basically the same thing and they tend
to stimulate agitation and the desire to move. That's what that's
about. Which brings us to the topic of exercise. Got a lot of
questions about exercise. What forms of exercise are best for sleeping
well? When should I exercise et cetera. There's a lot of them
individual variability around this, but I can talk about what I know
from the science literature and what I happened to do myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=2100"&gt;Exercise &amp;amp; Your Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are basically two forms of exercise that we can talk about
although, of course I realize there are many different forms of
exercise. There's much more nuance to this, but we can talk about
cardiovascular exercise, where the idea is to repeat a movement over
and over and over continuously. So that'd be like running, biking,
rowing and cycling this kind of thing. Or there's a resistance
exercise where you're moving, lifting, presumably putting down also
things of progressively heavier and heavier weight that you couldn't
do continuously for 30 minutes. So cardiovascular exercise is
typically the more aerobic type exercise and resistance exercise of
course is the more anaerobic type exercise. And yes, there's variation
between the two. Most studies of exercise have looked at aerobic
exercise because that's basically the thing that you can get a rat or
a mouse to do. You know what's really weird about rats and mice, they
like to run on wheels so much, that someone actually did this study,
it was published in science they put a wheel, a running wheel in the
middle of a field and mice ran to that wheel and ran on the wheel.
They turns out that what they like is the passage of the visual image
of the bars in front of their face, which I find kind of remarkable
and troubling because it seems so like trivial, but anyway they love
aerobic exercise. And so most of the studies were done on these mice
that love running on wheels. Whereas so far as it's been challenging
to find conditions in which mice really liked to lift weights or we'll
do it in a laboratory. So any weight bearing exercise studies really
have to be done in humans. And since humans are what we're interested
in, there are some studies looking at these two things and when they
tend to work best. Now you will see some places aerobic exercise is
best done in the morning and weight training is best done in the
afternoon. I think there's far more individual variation than that. I
think there are however, a couple of windows that the exercise science
literature and the circadian literature points to as windows related
to body temperature in which performance, injury, in which performance
is optimized injury is reduced and so on. And those tend to be 30
minutes after waking. And that probably correlates with the inflection
in cortisol associated with waking whether or not you've gotten light
or not, three hours after waking, which probably correlates to the
rise in body temperature sometime right around waking. And the later
afternoon, usually 11 hours after waking which is when temperature
tends to peak. So some people like to exercise in the morning. Some
people like to exercise in the afternoon. It really depends. I think
for those of us with very busy schedules, it's advantageous to be able
to do your training whenever you have the opportunity to do it, unless
you can really control your schedule. And so I would never want these
recommendations to seem like recommendations, what I'm really
describing are some opportunities, 30 minutes after waking, three
hours after waking or 11 hours after waking has been shown at least in
some studies to optimize performance, reduce injury and that sort of
thing. But you really have to figure out what works for you. A note
about working out first thing in the morning. Last time we talked
about non-photo phase shifts. If you exercise first thing in the
morning, your body will start to develop an anticipatory circuit.
There's actually plasticity in these circadian circuits that will lead
you to want to wake up at the particular time that you exercised the
previous three or four days. So that can be a powerful tool but you
still want to get light exposure. Because it turns out that light and
exercise converged, so giving even bigger, wake up signal to the brain
and body. So you might want to think about that. Some people find if
they exercise late in the day they have trouble sleeping in general
intense exercise does that, whereas the kind of lower intensity
exercise doesn't. I found some interesting literature that talked
about sleep need and exercise. I found this fascinating that if one is
waking not feeling rested and recovered from and yet sleeping the same
amount that they typically have, it's quite possible that the
intensity of exercise in the proceeding two or three days is too high.
Whereas if one can't recover no matter how much sleep they get,
they're just sleepy all the time, I realized these things are
correlated that the volume of training might be too high. Now I'm not
an exercise scientist. We should probably get Andy Galpin or somebody
else on here, who's really an expert in this kind of stuff. I do
realize as soon as anyone talks about exercise or nutrition publicly,
they're basically opening themselves up to all sorts of challenges
because you can basically find support for almost any protocol in the
literature. What I've looked at was two journals in particular,
International Journal Chronobiology and journal Biological Rhythms.
Excuse me, to assess these parameters that I I've mentioned just just
a moment ago because the studies tended to be done in humans. They
were fairly recent and they came from groups that I recognized as well
as knowing that those journals are peer reviewed. Many of your
questions were about neural plasticity which is the brain and nervous
system's ability to change in response to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=2430"&gt;Neuroplasticity &amp;amp; Food/Chemicals/NSDR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a question that asked whether or not these really deep
biological mechanisms around wakefulness, time of waking sleep, et
cetera were subject to neuroplasticity and indeed they are. Some of
that plasticity is short-term and some of it is more long-term.
There's a really good analogy here which is, if you happen to eat on a
very tight schedule where every day say it 8:00 AM, noon and 7:00 PM
is when you eat your food not suggesting you do this but let's say you
were to do that for a couple of days. After a few days, you would
start to anticipate those meal times where no matter where you were in
the world, no matter what was going on in your life about five to 10
minutes before those meal times, you would start to feel hungry and
even a little agitated, which is your body's way of trying to get you
to forage for food. And that's because of some peptide signals that
come from the periphery from your body, things like hypocretin norexin
that signal to the hypothalamus and brainstem to make you active and
alert and look for food and feel hungry. So there's kind of an
anticipatory circuit, that's a chemical circuit, but eventually over
time, the neurons, the neural circuits that control hypocretin orexin
would get tuned to the neural circuits that are involved in eating and
maybe even smell and taste to create a kind of eating circuit that's
unique to your pattern, to your rhythms. The same thing is true for
these waking and exercise and other schedules, including all trade-in
schedules. If you wake up in the morning and start getting your
sunlight, you start exercising in the morning or you exercise in the
afternoon, pretty soon, your body will start to anticipate that and
start to secrete hormones and other signals that prepare your body for
the ensuing activity of waking up or going to sleep. So if you get
onto a pattern or a rhythm, even if that rhythm isn't down to the
minute, you'll find that there's plasticity in these circuits and it
becomes easier to wake up early. If that's your thing or exercise at a
particular day if that's your thing. That's the beauty of
neuroplasticity. A number of people ask, "What can I do to increase
plasticity?" And that really comes in two forms. There's plasticity
that we can access in sleep to improve rates of learning and depth of
learning from the previous day or so. And there's this an SDR non-
sleep deep breaths that can be done without sleeping, to improve rates
of learning and depth of retention, et cetera. So let's consider those
both and you can incorporate these protocols if you like. Again, these
are based on quality peer reviewed studies. First, let's talk about
learning in sleep. This is based on some work that I'll provide the
reference for that was published in the journal Science. Excellent
journal, Matt Walker also talks about some of these studies done by
others in his book "Why We Sleep". The studies just to remind you are
structured in he following way an individual is brought into a
laboratory, Lowe does a spatial memory task. So there tends to be a
screen with a bunch of different objects popping up on the screen in
different locations. So it might be a Bulldog's face that might be a
cat, and it might be an Apple than it might be a pen in different
locations. And that sounds trivial easy but with time you can imagine
it gets pretty tough to come back a day later and remember, if
something presented in a given location was something you've seen
before and whether or not it was presented in that location or a
different location. If you had enough objects and changed locations
enough, this can actually be quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=2650"&gt;Using Sound &amp;amp; Smell To Learn Faster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the subjects either just went through the experiment or
a particular odor was released into the room while they were learning
or a tone was played in the room while they were learning. And then
during the sleep of those subjects the following night and the
following night, so this was done repeatedly for several nights, the
same odor or tone was played while the subjects were sleeping. They
did this in different stages of sleep non-REM sleep and rapid eye
movement, sleep REM sleep. They did this with just the tone in sleep.
If the subjects had the odor but not the tone, they did it with
putting the tone, if they had had the odor while learning. So
basically all the controls, all the things you'd want to see done to
make sure that it wasn't some indirect effects, a modulatory effect.
Okay. And what they found was that providing the same stimulus, the
odor, if they smelled an odor or a tone if the subjects heard a tone
while learning if they just delivered that odor or tone while the
subject slept, rates of learning and retention of information was
significantly greater. This is pretty cool. What this means that you
can cue the subconscious brain, and the asleep brain to learn
particular things better and faster. So how might you implement this?
Well, you could play with this if you want. I don't see any real
challenge to this provided the odor and is a safe one and then doesn't
wake you up and the tone is a safe one, and doesn't wake you up. You
could do this by having a metronome, for instance, while I'm learning
something, playing in the background or particular music and then have
that very faintly while you sleep. So you could apply this if you like
and try this. There are a number of groups I think now that are trying
this using tactile stimulation. So slight vibration on the wrist
during learning and then the same vibration on the wrist during sleep.
It does not appear that the sensory modality, whether or not it's odor
or auditory tone or tactile stimulation, some as a sensory
stimulation, whether or not it matters. It's remarkable because it
really shows that sleep is an extension of the waking state. We've
known that for a long time but this really tethers those two in a very
meaningful and actionable way. So I think I'll report back to you as I
learned more about these studies, but that's what I know about them at
this point. As long as we're there we might as well talk about
dreaming 'cause I got so many questions about dreams. A couple of you,
we want to ask me what their dreams meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=2805"&gt;Dream Meaning &amp;amp; Remembering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I don't even know what my dreams mean half the time. I
occasionally will wake up from a dream and remember it. If you want to
remember your dreams better, if you're somebody who has challenges
remembering your dreams, you can set your alarms that you wake up in
the middle of this one of these 90 minute cycles which toward morning
tend to be occupied almost exclusively by REM sleep. Remember early in
the night, you have less REM sleep than later in the night. But you
want to get as much sleep as you can 'cause that's healthy. So I don't
know that you want to wake yourself up. Some people find that writing
down their thoughts immediately first thing in the morning allows them
to relater spontaneously remember their dream they had. There's some
literature on that. The meaning of dreams is a little bit
controversial. Some people believe they have strong meaning other
people believe that they can be just spontaneous firing of neurons
that were active in the waking state and don't have any meaning. There
are good data to show that when you learn spatial, new spatial
environments that there's a replay of those environments, so-called
place cells that fire in your brain only when you enter a particular
environment, that those are replayed in sleep in almost direct fashion
to the way that things were activated when you were learning that
spatial task. Dreams are fascinating, they're were paralyzed during
dreams which brings us to another question. Somebody asked about sleep
paralysis. We are paralyzed for much of our sleep, so-called atonia so
presumably so we don't act out our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=2895"&gt;Waking Up Paralyzed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people wake up and they're still paralyzed. I've actually had
this happen to me not very many times, but a few times. And then they
jolt themselves awake and it actually is quite terrifying. I can say
from personal experience to wake up be wide awake and you cannot move
your body at all. It's really quite frightening. There are a couple of
things that will increase the intrusion of atonia into the wakeful
state which is essentially means you're waking up but you can't, you
can't move. One is marijuana, THC, a I'm not a marijuana smoker. I'm
not a copper. I don't know the legality where you live. So I'm not
saying one thing or another about marijuana. I'm just, the fact that I
had that experience without marijuana means that it can happen
regardless, but marijuana smokers, for whatever reason maybe it has
something to do with the cannabinoid receptors or the serotonin
receptors downstream of the motor pathways. I don't know. I couldn't
find any literature on this but marijuana smokers report, higher
frequency of this kind of paralysis and wakefulness as you transition
from sleep to wakefulness. I suppose probably one could learn to get
comfortable with it. For me, it was terrifying, 'cause I'm just used
to being able to move my limbs fortunately and I wasn't able to, and
it's a quite a thing, let me tell you, okay. some other questions
about neuroplasticity. So the other form of neuroplasticity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=2980"&gt;Nap/Focus Ratios For Accelerated Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is not the neuroplasticity that you're amplifying by listening to
tones or smelling odors in sleep, but the neuroplasticity that you can
access with non sleep deep rest. So NSDR, non sleep deep rest as well
as short 20 minute naps, which are very close to non sleep deep rest
because people rarely drop into deep States of sleep during short
naps, unless they're very sleep deprived. NSDR has been shown to
increase rates of learning when done for 20 minute bouts for a proxy
to match an approximately 90 minute about of learning. So what am I
talking about? 90 minute cycles are these ultradian cycles that I've
talked about previously. And we tend to learn very well by taking a 90
minute cycle transitioning into some focus mode early in the cycle,
and it's hard to focus and then deep focus and learning feels almost
like agitation and strain and then by the end of that 90 minute cycle,
it becomes very hard to maintain focus and learn more information.
There's a study published in Cell Reports last year. Great journal,
excellent paper showing that 20 minute naps or light sleep of a sort
of non sleep deep rest taken immediately after or close to it, doesn't
have to be immediately after you finished the last sentence of
learning or whatever it is, or bar of music. But you know, a couple of
minutes after transitioning to a period of non sleep deep rest, where
you're turning off the analysis of duration path and outcome has been
shown to accelerate learning to a significant degree. Both the amount
of information and the retention of that information. So that's pretty
cool, because this is a cost-free, drug-free way of accelerating
learning without having to get more sleep. But simply by introducing
these 20 minute bouts. I would encourage people if they want to try
this to consider the 20 minutes per every 90 minutes of ultradian
learning cycle, there you're incorporating a number of different
neuroscience backed tools 90 minute cycles for focused learning. It
could be motor, it could be cognitive, it could be musical, whatever,
and then transitioned to a 20 minute non sleep deep rest protocol. I
just want to cue you the fact that in last` episode in the caption on
YouTube, we provided links to two different yoga nidra, non sleep deep
rest protocols as well as hypnosis protocols that are clinically
backed from my colleague David Spiegel at Stanford Psychiatry
Department. All those resources are free. There are also a lot of
other hypnosis scripts out there. I like the ones from Michael Sealey
S-E-A-L, I think it's E-Y, maybe it's just L-Y, you can find them
easily on YouTube, clinical hypnosis scripts meaning not stage
hypnosis. They're not designed to get you to do anything. In fact
they're just designed to help rewire your brain circuitry. Now, how
does hypnosis work that way? This has a lot to do with sleep because
it engages neuro-plasticity by bringing together two things that
normally are separate from one another, one is the alert focused
wakeful state where you activate the learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=3165"&gt;Hypnotizing Yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there's the deep rest where the actual reconfiguration of the
neurons and synopsis takes place. Hypnosis brings both the focus and
the deep rest component into the same compartment of time. It's a very
unique state in that way. So hypnosis kind of maximizes the learning
about and the non sleep deep breasts bow and combines them. But of
course that requires some guidance from a script or from a hypnotist
clinically, a trained hypnotist and it becomes hard to acquire
detailed information. It's more about shifts in state, like fear to
states of calm or smoking to quitting smoking, anxiety around a trauma
to release of anxiety around a trauma rather than specific information
learned in hypnosis, okay? So hypnosis seems more about modulating the
circuits that underlie state as opposed to specific information.
Although I would not be surprised if there weren't certain forms of
hypnosis that could increase retention and learning of specific
information, but I'm not aware of any of those protocols out there
yet. Which brings us to the next thing about learning and plasticity
which is nootropics, AKA smart drugs. [sighs]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=3245"&gt;Smart Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big topic that sigh was a sigh of concern about how to
address nootropics in a thorough enough, but thoughtful enough way.
Look, I have a lot of thoughts about nootropics. First of all, it
means smart drugs, I believe. And I don't like that phrase because
let's just take a step back and think about exercise. You just say, I
want to be more physically fit. What does that mean? Does it mean I
would ask for more specificity, I'd say, Do you want to be stronger?
Okay, maybe you need to lift heavier objects progressively. Do you
want more endurance very different protocol to access endurance. Do
you want flexibility? Do you want explosiveness or suppleness? Huge
range of things that we call physical fitness. Maybe you want all of
those. If we were talking about emotional fitness we would say, well,
inability to feel empathy but probably also to disengage from empathy
because you don't want to be tethered to other people's emotions all
the time. That's not healthy either. You would think about being able
to access a range of emotions, but for some people their range into
the sadness regime is really quite vast but their range into the
happiness regime might be kind of limited. For other people who are in
a manic state, it might be, they can access all that happy stuff but
not the sadder stuff. So I'm speaking by way of analogy here. But if
we say we're talking about cognitive and cognitive abilities we have
to ask, okay, creativity, memory. We tend to associate intelligence
with memory. And I think this goes back to like spelling bees or
something, the ability to retain a lot of information and just
regurgitate information which will get you some distance in some
disciplines of life. But it won't allow you creative thinking, it's
necessary for creative thinking. You need a knowledge base, right? You
can't just look up everything on Google, despite what you know,
certain educators or so-called educators say, you need a database so
that you can have the raw materials with which to be creative. So
necessary to have memory but not sufficient to be creative, right? The
creative could have a poor memory for certain things but certainly not
for everything. They can't have anterograde and retrograde amnesia.
They'd be like the goldfish that every time around the tank, it, you
know I can't remember where it's at. I actually don't know that
they've ever done that experiment by the way, but you know, so no
disrespect to goldfish but you know, so you get the idea. You've got
creativity, you have memory, you have the ability to task switch,
right? You have the ability to strategy development, strategy
implement. So the problem I have with the concept of a nootropic or a
smart drug is it's not specific as to what cognitive algorithm you're
trying to engage. We need more specificity. That said, there are
elements to learning that we've discussed here before that are very
concrete things like the ability to focus and put the blinders on to
everything else that's happening in around you and in your head
mainly, right? Distractions about things you should be doing, could be
doing or might be doing and focus on what you need to do. And then
that's required for triggering the acetylcholine neuromodulator that
will then allow you to highlight the particular synopsis that will
then later change in sleep. So no nootropic allows you to bypass the
need for sleep in deep rest. That's important to understand. So I
daydream about a day when people will be able to access compounds that
are safe, that will allow them to learn better meaning, to access
information, focus better, as well as to sleep better and activate the
plasticity from the learning about. Right now most nootropics tend to
bundle a bunch of things together. Most of them include some form of
stimulant, caffeine. Episode two, I'll tell you more probably than you
ever wanted to know about caffeine, adenosine and how that works. So
refer there for how caffeine works. But stimulants will allow you to
increase focus up to a particular point. If you have too little
alertness in your system, you can't focus, too much however, you start
to cliff and focus drifts, okay? So you can't just ingest more
stimulant to be more focused. It doesn't work that way. Most
nootropics also include things that increase or a desire to increase
acetylcholine. Things like alpha GPC and other things of that sort.
And indeed, there's some evidence that they can increase
acetylcholine. I refer you again to examine.com the website to
evaluate any supplements or compounds for their safety and their
effects in humans and animals, free website as well as with links to
studies. So we need the focus component. We need the alertness
component. The alertness component comes from epinephrin,
traditionally from caffeine stimulation. The acetylcholine stimulation
traditionally comes from Coleen donors or alpha GPC, things of that
sort. And then you would want to have some sort of off switch, because
anything that's going to really stimulate your alertness, that then
provides a crash. That crash is not a crash into the deep kind of
restful slumber that you would want for learning, it's a crash into
the kind of, let's just call it lopsided sleep, meaning it's deep
sleep but it lacks certain spindles and other elements of the
physiology sleep spindles, that really engage the learning process and
the reconfiguration of synopsis. So right now, my stance on nootropics
is that maybe, maybe for occasional use, provided it's safe for you,
I'm not recommending it, but in general it tends to use more of a
shotgun approach than is probably going to be useful for learning and
memory in the long run. A lot of people ask about Modafinil or
armodafinil which was designed for treatment of narcolepsy. So right
there, it tells you it's a stimulant. And yes, there is evidence, it
will improve learning memory. Modafinil is very expensive. Last time I
checked our Modafinil I think is the recent released a generic version
of this that's far less expensive. Most of these things look a lot
like amphetamine and many of them have the potential for addiction or
can be habit forming. But more importantly, a lot of those things also
can create metabolic effects by disruption to insulin receptors and so
forth. So you want to approach those with a strong sense of caution.
Now, there are the milder things that act as nootropics that I
mentioned, some of them like alpha GPC. Some people like Gingko.
Gingko gives me vicious headaches, so I don't take it. So people
really differ. Last podcast, I recommend magnesium threonate if you
were exploring supplements I'm not recommending anything directly. I'm
just saying if you're exploring supplements, magnesium threonate seems
among the magnesiums to be one of the more bioavailable and useful for
sleep. I recommended it actually to a good friend of mine, it gave him
at very low dose, he had stomach issues with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=3670"&gt;Magnesium: Yay, Nay, or Meh?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He just had to simply stop taking it. So there's variability there.
You just, it gave him some stomach cramping and just didn't feel good
on it. Stopped it, he felt better. Other people take magnesium
threonate and feel great. I was asked, do magnesium need to be taken
with or without food or before sleep? If you're going to go that route
it should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before sleep, 'cause it's designed
to make you sleepy. And I'm not aware that it has to be taken with
food, but again all of this has to be run by your doctor and this is
your healthcare to govern not, these are not strict recommendations so
look into it. But magnesium threonate, most people I recommend it to
have benefit from it tremendously. Some people can't tolerate it, so
you have to find out. There were a number of questions about other
supplements designed to access deep sleep, in part to access
neuroplasticity, but now I'm just sort of transitioning from
neuroplasticity to these compounds that can regulate sleep. One of
them that I discussed at the end of the last podcast, I got a lot of
questions about is apigenin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=3730"&gt;How Apigenin Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin. If you will look in the literature the way
it works is it increases some of the enzymes associated with GABA
metabolism. It actually, GABA's an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It's
the neurotransmitter that is increased after a couple alcohol drinks
containing alcohol. And that shut down the forebrain. Apigenin is a
derivative of the camomile. I think that the proper pronunciation of
this is metric caria kemo mila. Although I always feel like I should
be using a Spanish accent. Whenever I say something like that other
related things that impact the GABA system and increase GABA or things
like passion flower which is [speaks in foreign language]. [chuckles]
I don't know why the Italian, is that Italian. Anyway, my Italian
colleagues, please forgive me. I have some very close Italian friends
and colleagues in Genoa. I butchered the Italian, sorry. In any event
apigenin and passion flower found in a lot of, a lot of supplements
designed to increase sleepiness and sleep because, and they work
presumably because they increase GABA. Actually they work on chloride
channels rather than give you a whole lecture on membrane biophysics
in neurons. I'll just say that when neurons are really active it's
because sodium ions, salt rushes into the cells and causes them to
fire electrically. The cells tend to become less active as more
chloride which is a negatively charged ion. This is probably taking
some of you back to the either the wonderful times or traumas of high
school physics. The chloride is negatively charged so, it tends to
make cells less electrically positive, 'cause carries a negative
charge and hyperpolarizes the neuron. So apigenin works through these
increasing the activity of these chloride channels. Passionflower
works by increasing the activity of these chloride channels and GABA
transmission. It tends to increase this inhibitory neurotransmitter
that shuts off our thinking our analysis of duration path and outcome.
So if you're going to explore these things I suggest you at least know
how they work. You at least go to examined.com that you talked to your
doctor about them. Some people asked about serotonin for getting to
sleep and staying asleep. Now I understand the rationale here. Just
like I understand the rationale of taking something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=3870"&gt;Serotonin: Slippery Slope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like Macuna Purina or L-DOPA to increase dopamine but sometimes what
works on paper doesn't really work in the real world. I personally
have tried taking a supplement which was Al tryptophan, which is the
precursor to serotonin or five HTP, which is designed to increase, it
is serotonin basically. You're just a one biochemical step away from
actually taking actual serotonin. And I'll be honest the sleep that I
had with increased serotonin by way of tryptophan or five HTP was
dreadful. I fell asleep almost immediately. You say, well, that's
great. And 90 minutes later, I woke up and I couldn't sleep almost for
48 hours. Now that was me, I have a pretty sensitive system to certain
things and not to other things. Some people love these things. So you
really have to be thoughtful and explore them with that kind of
awareness of being thoughtful and realizing that what works for you
might not work for everybody and what works for everybody might not
work for you. Okay? I'd like to continue by talking about the role of
temperature in sleep, accessing sleep, staying asleep and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=3935"&gt;The Frog Experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first I want to tell a joke. Because I think this joke really
captures some of the critical things to understand about any self-
experimentation that you might do. So this is a story that was told to
me by a colleague of mine who's now a professor of Caltech not to be
named. So there's a scientist and they're in their lab. And they're
trying to understand how the nervous system works. So they go over to
a tank and they pick up a frog, and they take the frog and they put it
down on the table And they clap. [claps] And the frog jumps. So they
think for awhile, they pick up the frog, okay. They go over to the
cabinet and they take out a little bit of a paralytic drug and they
inject it locally into the back leg, set it down and clap. [claps] And
the frog jumps, but it kind of like jumps to the side a little bit.
They pick it up, they inject the paralytic into the other back leg.
They clap again, the frog jumps, but it really doesn't jump well that
time, it kind of drags itself forward. So they pick it up and they
inject the paralytic into the remaining two legs. They set it down and
they clap and the frog doesn't jump. And they go, "Oh my goodness! The
legs are used for hearing." Now they publish the paper. Paper comes
out in a great journal, news releases. It's a really big deal, their
career takes off. 20 years later, a really smart graduate student
comes along and says, "Yeah but that's loss of function. It doesn't
really show gain of function." So let's take a closer look. So they
repeat the first experiment and checks out, everything happens the
same way, but then they take the frog and they inject a drug into all
four legs that turns off the paralytic, right? It's an antagonist.
They set the frog down, they clap, and the frog jumps and they go, "Oh
my goodness! It's true. The legs really are for hearing." Now, first
of all, I want to make the point that this is not to illustrate that
science is not a good practice, it is. We need to do loss of function
and gain and function experiments. But just to show that correlation
and causation is complicated. You need to do a variety of control
experiments, and you really need to figure out what works for you. And
so while science can provide answers about what works under very
controlled conditions, it doesn't and can never address all the
situations in which a given compound, a given practice will or won't
work. And it's not just individual variability is that there are a
number of different factors. You all of course know that light can
activate and shift your circadian rhythm, but so can exercise, so can
food. The last point I want to make is an important one, which is that
no frogs were hurt in the telling of this joke. Okay. So let's
continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=4115"&gt;Temperature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about temperature. Temperature is super interesting as
it relates to circadian rhythms and wakefulness and sleep. First let's
take a look at what's happening to our body temperature across each
24-hour cycle. In general, our temperature tends to be lowest right
around 4:00 AM and starts creeping up around 6:00 AM, 8:00 AM and
peaks sometime between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. Now that varies from
person to person, but in general if we were to continuously monitor or
occasionally monitor temperature that's what we would see. Now what's
interesting is that even in the absence of any light cues or meal
cues, we would have a shift. We would have an oscillation or a rhythm
in our temperature. They would go from high to low. This is why the
idea that we're all 96.8 and that's our correct temperature. Forget
that. That is no longer true. It never was true. It depends on what
time of day you measure temperature. However, there is a range which
is within normal range, I think most of us associate fever with
somewhere around 100, 101 103, that's concerning. And we will be very
concerned if temperature drop too low as well. The way that the
temperature rhythm that's indogenous, that's within us and rhythmic no
matter what, the way it gets anchored to the pattern I described
before, or being lowest at 4:00 AM and increasing again around,
through the day until about four to 6:00 PM is by way of entrainment
or matching to some external cue, which is almost always going to be
light, but also exercise. Now you may have experienced this
temperature rhythm and how quickly it can become uninterested or it
can fall out of entrainment. Here's an experiment I wouldn't want you
to do but you've probably experienced this before, where you wake up,
it's sunny outside,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=4230"&gt;Morning Chills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and maybe you have some email or some things to take care of or maybe
you didn't sleep that well the night before and so you stay in doors.
You don't change anything about your breakfast, you don't change
anything about your within home temperature or anything like that. And
somewhere right around 10 or 11 o'clock you start feeling kind of
chilled, like you're cold. Well, what happened was the oscillators,
the clocks in your various tissues that are governed by temperature
and circadian rhythm are starting to split away from your central
clock mechanisms. So it's actually important that your temperature
match day length. Now there's another way in which temperature
matches, oh daytime, excuse me. There's also an important way in which
temperature matches day length in general as days get longer, it tends
to be hotter out. Not always, but in general, that's the way it is.
And as days get shorter, it tends to be colder outside. So temperature
and day length are also linked metabolically. They're linked
biologically they're linked, excuse me, and atmospherically they're
linked for the reason that we talked about before about duration of
day length and other climate features and so forth. So one of the most
powerful things about setting your circadian rhythm properly is that
your temperature will start to fall into a regular rhythm. And that
temperature has a very strong effect on things like metabolism and
when you will feel most willing and interested in exercising,
typically the willingness to exercise and engage in any kind of
activity mental or physical is going to be when that rise in
temperature is steepest. When the slope of that line is greatest.
That's why 30 minutes after waking is one of those key windows, as
well as three hours after waking. And then when temperature actually
peaks which is generally, generally about 11 hours after waking. So
this is why we say that temperature and circadian rhythm are linked
but they're actually even more linked than that. We've talked before
about how light enters the eye, triggers activation of these
melanopsin cells, which then triggers activation of the super
charismatic nucleus, the master circadian clock. And then I always say
the master circadian clock informs all the cells and tissues of your
body and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm. But what I've never
answered was how it actually puts them into that rhythm. And it does
it two ways. One is it secretes a peptide. And peptide is just a
little protein that floats through the bloodstream and signals to the
cells. Okay, we're tuning your clock. Kind of like a little, we know
watch store, the watch store owner would tune the clocks. But the
other way is it synchronizes the temperature under which those cells
exist. So temperature is actually the effector of the circadian
rhythm. Now this is really important because changes in temperature by
way of exercise, by way of eating, but especially by way of exercise
can start to shift our circadian rhythm pretty dramatically. But let's
even go to in a more extreme example. Nowadays, there's some interest
in cold showers and ice baths, not everybody is doing this I realize.
People seem to either love this or hate this. I don't mind the cold
dunk thing. I get regular about this from time to time and I'll do it.
I haven't been doing it recently. It's always painful to do the first
couple of times then you get kind of used to it. However, I've taken
people to a cold, dunk or an ice bath. I have a family member who
wouldn't get in literally passed her toes. She was like, this is just
too aversive for me. Some people really like the cold, people very
tremendously. Getting into an ice bath is very interesting because you
have a rebound increase in thermogenesis. Now you should know from the
previous episode that as that temperature increases, it will shift
your circadian rhythm and which direction it shifts your circadian
rhythm will depend on whether or not you're doing it during the
daytime or late in the day. If you do it after 8:00 PM, it's going to
make your day longer, right? Because your body and your central clocks
are used to temperature going up early in the day and throughout the
day and peaking in the afternoon. If you then increase that further or
you simply increase it over its baseline at 8:00 PM after temperature
was already falling, even if it's just by a half a degree or a couple
of degrees or you do that with exercise doesn't have to be with the
ice bath, you are extending, you are shifting forward your phase,
delaying your clock. You're convincing your clock and therefore the
rest of your body that the day is still going, right? You you're
giving it the perception, the cellar and physiological perception that
the day is getting longer. And you will want to naturally stay up
later and wake up later. Now you might say, "Wait I do an ice bath
late at night, and I feel great. And I fall deeply asleep." Well, cold
can trigger the release of melatonin. There's a rebound increase in
melatonin. So that could be the cause of that effect. You have to see
what works for you, but if you do the ice bath early in the day and
then get out you will experience a more rapid rise or cold shower
early in the day, a more rapid rise in your body temperature that will
phase advance your clock and make it easier to get up early the
following day. So for those of you that are having trouble getting up
and this is going to almost sound laughable but a cold shower first
thing in the morning will wake you up, but that's waking you up in the
short term because of a different mechanism which I'll talk about in a
moment, but it also is shifting your clock, it's phase advancing your
clock in a way that makes you more likely to get up earlier the next
day, okay? So in other words, increasing your temperature by getting
in an ice bath or cold shower or exercising which causes a
compensatory increase in body temperature. Think about the normal
pattern of body temperature. Low around 4:35 AM starts to peak right
around waking start, excuse me, starts to increase right around waking
then steep slope, steep slope to a peak around four to 6:00 PM and
then drops off. If you introduce an increase in body temperature by
way of cold exposure early in the day, let's say 6:00 AM or 5:00 AM if
you're masochistic enough to get into a cold shower at that time more
power to you, it's going to make, you want to wake up about half hour
to an hour earlier the next day than you normally would. Whereas if
you do it while your temperature is falling, it will tend to delay and
make your body perceive as if the day is getting longer. These are
phase advances and phase delays. We're going to get into this in far
more detail when we talk about jet lag and shift work in episode four
as well as other other things. But temperature is, again is not just
one tool to manipulate wake up time and circadian rhythm and
metabolism. It is the effector. It is the way that the central
circadian clock impacts all the cells and tissues of your body. If you
want to read further about this and you're really curious about the
role of temperature work by Joe Takahashi who used to be at
Northwestern University and is now at UT Southwestern in Dallas,
incredible scientist and has really worked out a lot of the mechanisms
around temperature in circadian rhythms. You can just Google his name
and you'll see a whole bunch of studies there. I want to talk about
cold and cold exposure because there's a great misconception about
this that actually you can leverage once you understand how to use
cold to either increase thermogenesis and fat loss, metabolism, or you
can use it for stress, mitigation and mood. And it really depends on
one simple feature of how you approach the ice bath or cold shower. If
you get into an ice bath or cold shower and you are calming yourself
you're actively calming the autonomic nervous system. Maybe through
some deep breathing, maybe through visualization, maybe you sing a
song. You know, people do this stuff. They use various tools. Some
people find paying attention to an external stimulus is more helpful.
You know, thinking about something not the experience of the cold,
other people find that directly experiencing the cold in its most
intense form and kind of "going into the cold" is the best way to
approach it. It really varies for people. There's no right or wrong
way to go about this. But the goal of using cold exposure for stress
inoculation and to raise your stress threshold to be able to tolerate
heightened levels of real life stress, not the ice bath, but real life
stress like work stress and relational stress, et cetera is by
suppressing the activation of the so-called sympathetic nervous
system, meaning the alertness or stress system. That involves
buffering or trying to resist the shiver response. The shiver response
is an autonomic response designed to generate heat, presumably, and
actually that is what it does in order to counter the cold. So when
you use cold exposure and you're kind of muscling through it, or
you're learning to relax within it as a form of stress inoculation,
that's great and works quite well for that purpose. And there's a
reason why cold exposure is used in a variety of forms of military
stress inoculation, most famous of which of course is the Navy seal
buds, a strep test really, which is screening procedure for becoming a
seal involves a lot of exposure to cold water. However, if you're
interested in using cold exposure for fat loss and thermogenesis, you
want to do the exact opposite thing. There was a paper published in
nature two years ago which showed that cold induced shiver, the actual
physical shiver activates the release of a chemical in the body from
muscle called succinate S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E. Succinate travel in the
bloodstream and then goes and activates a particular category of fat
not the typical kind pink or white fat that we think of is like
blubber in humans. That the stuff that people will seem to generally
want less of, except for those genetic freaks that seem to have none
of it depending what they consume. Congratulations. Brown fat is
called Brown fat because it's actually dark under the microscope. It's
rich with mitochondria and it exists mostly between the scapulae and
in the upper neck. And it generates thermogenesis and heat in the
body. It's rich with a certain category of agile anergic receptor, in
insanely epinephrin binds to adrenergic receptors. These Brown fat
cells increase metabolism, it's called Brown fat thermogenesis and
cause fat burning, burning of other kinds of fat, the pink and white
fat. So what does this all mean? This means if you want to use the ice
bath in order to increase metabolism, shiver away. If you want to use
the ice bath or cold shower in order to stress inoculate, resist the
shiver and learn to stay calm or "muscle through it". I mean, I don't
know that anyone's ever really talked about this publicly because I
think the data are so new. And I think that people assume that the ice
bath or cold exposure is just one thing. Here I've talked about it
three ways to shift your circadian rhythm depending on whether or not
you're doing it early in the day while your temperature is still
rising or at its peak or after that peak, in order to extend the
perception of your day as continuing and make you want to go to sleep
later and wake up later. Now, and then the third way of course is to
either activate brown fat thermogenesis and increase metabolism. I
suppose the fourth way would be to increase stress tolerance or stress
threshold, okay? But remember, temperature is the effector of
circadian rhythms. Light is the trigger. The super charismatic nucleus
is the master circadian clock that mediates all these changes, also
influenced by non-photic influence like exercise and feeding and
things of that sort. But temperature is the effector. Now you can also
shift your circadian rhythm with eating. When you travel and you land
in a new location and your schedule is inverted 12 hours. One way that
we know you can shift your rhythm more quickly is to get onto the
local meal schedule. Now that probably has to do with two effects. One
or changes in temperature inducer, eating induced increases in body
temperature. Now you should understand why that would work as well as
eating has this anticipatory secretion of beta, of hyper cretin orexin
that I talked about it earlier. So, if this is getting a little too
down in the weeds, don't worry about it. I will get more into this in
episode four of how to shift one's rhythm. But I would love for people
to understand that light and temperature are the real heavy duty
leavers when it comes to moving your circadian rhythm and sleep times
and activity schedules and exercise and feeding can help, but really
temperature and light, with light being the primary one are the most
important when it comes to sleep and wakefulness. Many people asked
questions about food and neurotransmitters and how those relate to
sleep, wakefulness and mood, which is essentially 25 hours of content
for me to cover. But I'm going to try and distill out the most common
questions. We've talked a lot about neuromodulators like dopamine,
acetylcholine and norepinephrine. You may notice in those discussions
that the precursors to say serotonin is tryptophan. Tryptophan
actually comes from the diet. It comes from the foods that we eat.
tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine. It comes from the foods that we
eat. And then once we ingest them those compounds are circulated to a
variety of different cells and tissues, but it is true that our food
and the particular foods we can influence, things like neuromodulator
levels to some extent, it's not the only way, because there are also
enzymes and biochemical pathways that are going to regulate how much
tyrosine gets converted into dopamine and there are elements of the
dopaminergic neurons, the dopamine neurons themselves that are
electrical that have influence on this as well. But there are a couple
fair assumptions that we can make. First of all, nuts and meats in
particular red meats, tend to be rich in things like tyrosine, right?
That tells you right there, that because tyrosine is the precursor of
dopamine, and dopamine is the precursor of norepinephrine, and
epinephrine that those foods tend to lend themselves toward the
production of dopamine and epinephrin and the sorts of things that are
associated with wakefulness. Now, of course, the volume of food that
we eat also impacts our wakefulness. If we eat a lot of anything,
whether or not it's ribeye steaks, rice, or cardboard, please don't
eat cardboard, your stomach if it's very distended it will draw a lot
of blood into your gut and you will divert blood from other tissues
and you'll become sleepy. So it's not just about food content, it's
also about food volume, all right? Fasting states generally are
associated with more alertness, epinephrin so forth and fed states are
generally associated with more quiescence and relaxation, serotonin,
and the kind of things that lend themselves more towards sleep and
less toward alertness. Foods that are rich in tryptophan tend to be
things like white meat, turkey, also complex carbohydrates. So if you
like you can start experimenting depending on what foods you eat. You
can start experimenting with carbohydrate rich meals for accessing
sleep and more depth of sleep. This is actually something I personally
do. I tend to eat pretty low carbs during the day. I actually fast for
until about noon. Not because I have to work to do that, but because
I'd rather just drink caffeine and water during that time. And then
sometime around noon I can't take it anymore and I'm hungry. And I eat
and I try and eat low carb-ish unless I've worked out extremely hard
in the previous two hours, which I rarely do, although I do it
sometimes. And that meal is then designed to prolong my period of
wakefulness into the late afternoon. And then sometime around dinner
time which for me is around 6:37 PM, 8:00 PM. Sometimes as late as
9:00 PM, I tend to eat things like white meat, fish, pastas, rice,
that kind of thing. My favorite food of all for accessing tryptophan
is actually a starch. It's actually a vegetable. And it's the
croissant, which is my favorite vegetable. I don't eat those all the
time, but I love them and they seem to increase dopamine as well. I've
never actually done the mass spectrometry on a croissant, but they
definitely increase tryptophan and relaxation for me. In all
seriousness, low carbohydrate/fasted/ketogenic diets tend to lend
themselves toward wakefulness by way of increasing epinephrin,
norepinephrine, adrenaline dopamine, and things of that sort.
Carbohydrate rich meals. And I suppose we talked about meals as
opposed to diet tend to lend themselves more toward tryptophan,
serotonin and more lethargic states. There is very limited evidence
that I am aware of that carbohydrates should be eaten at one time a
day as it relates to metabolism, et cetera. I'm sure that will open up
a certain amount of debate. If you work out very hard and you deplete
glycogen, then this all changes. So some people are working out very
hard in depleting glycogen and other people are not. That gets way
outside the context of this particular podcast, but yes indeed
different foods can bias different neuromodulators and thereby can
modulate awaking or our feelings of lethargy and sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=5280"&gt;Eating For Heating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple effects of food that are independent or I should
say a couple of facts of eating, 'cause the food won't do it when it's
sitting across the table, but of eating that are powerful for
modulating circadian, rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera. And that's
because every time we eat we get eating induced thermogenesis
regardless of what we eat. Now that eating induced thermogenesis and
increase in metabolism, which is an increase in temperature really, is
probably greatest for amino acid rich foods like meats, but also other
types of foods. It's a minimal increase in body temperature compared
to say cold exposure or exercise. Now, whether or not it's a quarter
of a degree or half a degree or a degree, it really depends on the
individual. And of course there are blood sugar effects. There are
things like whether or not you are type one or type two diabetic,
whether or not you're insulin resistant, whether or not like there's a
kid who interns on the podcast here, who's 17 years old and I'm
convinced that he can eat anything and he just seems to like burn it
up and he's growing it every time. Actually the other day, he walked
into the other room and two days later, he walked out of the same
room. He came out in between of course, but and I was like, you're
grow? And he was like, you know, but he's at that stage where he's
just growing. Food is going to affect a teenager very differently than
it's going to affect a full-grown person. So, in general, starchy
carbohydrates, white meat, such as turkey, some fish increased
tryptophan, therefore serotonin, therefore more lethargic states more
calm. Meat, nuts and there are probably some plant-based foods that
I'm not aware of and I apologize, I should read up on this that also
are high in tyrosine that can increase things like dopamine,
norepinephrine, epinephrin alertness. So you can vary these however
you like. Most people I think are eating a variety of these things in
a given meals. And there are other parameters of nutrition that are
important too. Volume of food for the reasons that I mentioned before,
the volume of food in the gut, less food in the gut whether or not
it's empty or a small amount of food which tend to correlate with
wakefulness. Large volumes of food of any kind will tend to correlate
and drive the calming response and that's by way of this nerve pathway
called the vegas. We actually have sensory fibers in the gut that
communicate to a little protrusion of neurons that sit right next to
the juggler called the nodose ganglia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=5430"&gt;Vagal Pathways For Gut-Brain Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-O-D-O-S-E unlike Costello, it's no dose right now he's all dose.
Nodose actually means having many protrusions and it's like kind of a
lumpy collection of neurons. A ganglia is just a collection of
neurons. And then it goes into the brain stem and then forward in the
brain to the areas of the brain they're involved in production of
various neuromodulators. So what we eat and the volume of food are
both signaling to the brain. It's not just one or the other. And then
there's also this eating induced thermogenesis. And now, you know,
from the discussion about temperature that if you're eating early in
the day you're tending to shift your rhythm earlier. So that you'll
want to wake up earlier the next day if you're eating very late in the
day, even if you can fall asleep after that, there's a tendency for
you to want to sleep later the next day. Now this of course is all
going to be constrained by when your kids need to eat, and when your
spouse needs to eat, and when your friends need to eat, or if you live
alone or what other things you're doing, if you're like me and you
kind of don't eat until noon then eat sometime around noon. And then
I'm terrible about meals. I just start eating the ingredients while
I'm supposed to be cooking and then eventually they're all gone and I
guess that's a meal. It varies. Some people are neurotically attached
to a particular meal schedule. Some people are not. I take my light
exposure schedule far more seriously than I take my meal schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=5510"&gt;Sex Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although in general, try and eat healthy foods for the most part
croissants included. I was asked several times whether or not men and
women or males and females differ in terms of these neurotransmitter
phenotypes and the rhythms of sleep and temperature, or we could
probably devote a whole month and we probably will devote an entire
month to what are called sex differences because those tend to be
related to things we absolutely know like XX, or XY chromosomes or XYY
in some cases are double X chromosomes as opposed to gender, sex and
karyotype as we call it genetic makeup is crystal clear. There are
things that correlate with one or the other but it's complicated and
it's not something that's been explored in what I think is enough
detail. Actually recently, I guess it was about five years ago, the
national institutes of health made it a mandate that all studies use
sex as a biological variable, and actually explore both sexes of mice,
both sexes of humans when doing any kind of study because there was a
bias towards only using male animals or male subjects prior to that
time. So a lot of data now coming out revealing important sex
differences that I think are going to have powerful impact on health
practices, et cetera. Response to drugs, response to just different
sleep schedules, et cetera. Perhaps the most salient and obvious one
is that during pregnancy females experience a whole range of endocrine
and neuro effects and we definitely will devote a month to pregnancy
and childbirth and child rearing. And for that, I'd really like to
bring in some experts. I've got terrific colleagues at Stanford and
elsewhere that work on these things, so that we can go into those in
more depth. So I'm not blowing off those questions. I'm just, I'm kind
of pushing them down the road a little bit where I can give you a more
thorough answer. So as we finish up, I just want to offer you the
opportunity to do an experiment. We've talked about a lot of variables
that can impact sleep and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwSkFq4tyC0&amp;amp;t=5630"&gt;Self Experimentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in keeping with the theme of the podcast we are going to continue
to talk about sleep and wakefulness and tools for those, and the
science behind those tools as we go forward. But there are really just
four simple parameters that you have control over, that you can
immediately start to record and take note of just to see how you're
doing with these things. With no judgment or perhaps no change to what
you're actually doing. It might be interesting, just a suggestion to
write down for each day when you went outside to get sunlight and when
you did that, relative to waking. So you would write down, like the
way I do this in my calendar is I'll write down that I don't get exact
about it. I might say, I woke up at 6:15 and then I, as I'll put a W
6:15, and then SL for sunlight and you'll sometimes get outside right
away. Other times I'm less good at that. And I'll go out around, let's
say seven and for how long, I don't maybe like 10, 15 minutes or so.
And then I'll put a little check at the times that I eat my so-called
meals. Although, as I mentioned, sometimes my meals are a bunch of
small checks that just kind of extend through the late hours of the
day. Yours might be more confined to certain times. And then you might
just take note of when you exercised, just put down an E for when you
exercise. Weight training or aerobic exercise. And you might note when
you might've felt chilled or cold if you do, or you might've felt
particularly hot, or if you woke up in the middle of night, when you
felt particularly hot. And then the last thing you might want to do is
just write down if and when you did a non sleep deep rest protocol, an
STR protocol, that could be meditation, that could be yoga nidra, that
could be hypnosis. Anything that you're using to deliberately teach
your nervous system, how to go from more alertness to more calmness in
the waking state, even if it's waking up in the middle of the night
and doing an SDR protocol or in the afternoon, or first thing in the
morning to recover some sleep and ability to perform DPOs that you
might've lost from a minimal or poor night's sleep. So you're going to
rite down when you woke up, when you viewed sunlight, that might be in
the morning and the evening, or just the morning, hopefully it's the
morning and the evening, when you exercised, when you eat your meals
and using a simple record keeping scheme like W for waking, SL for
sunlight maybe you come up with a system where it's a check or an X or
something for exercise. This is not designed to make you neurotically
attached to tracking all your behaviors and everything you do. I for
instance, don't track what I eat. In particular, I kind of know what
works for me and I'd just try and stay within that range. But by doing
this you can start to reveal some really interesting patterns.
Patterns that no answer that I could provide you about any existing
tool or protocol could counter. It's really about taking the patterns
of behaviors, of waking, and light viewing, and eating, and exercise
and superimposing that on what you're learning in this podcast and
elsewhere of course and what you already know and trying to see where
certain problem or problems or pain points might be arising. Maybe
you're eating really late in the day and you're waking up in the
middle of the night, really warm. Well, now you would say, "Well, that
could be due to kind of an increase in temperature that is extending
my day or maybe you start to find that using cold exposure early in
the day is great for you, but using it late, if it's too late in the
day, that's not great. Or if you're into the sauna or it's even like
some people, including myself, if I take a hot shower or sit in a hot
tub or a sauna late at night, well then I get a compensatory decrease
in body temperature and I sleep great provided I hydrate well enough,
'cause that can be kind of a dehydrating thing to sit in hot, hot
conditions. But if I do the sauna early in the day, unless I exercise
immediately afterward then I tend to get the temperature drop, which
makes sense because when you get in the sauna, you're get
vasodilation. You throw off a lot of heat and then you generally get a
compensatory drop in temperature. If you do that early in the day,
that's right about the time that temperature is trying to entrain the
circadian clocks of your body. That's what happens to me. Other
people, it might be slightly different and some people have more
resilient systems than others. So I just encourage you to start
becoming scientists of your own physiology of your own brain and body
and seeing how the various tools that you may or may not be using are
effecting your patterns of sleep, your patterns of attention and
wakefulness. It's vitally important that if you do this, that you know
that it's not about trying to get onto an extremely rigid schedule,
it's really about trying to identify variables that are most powerful
for you, and that push you in the direction that you want to go. And
changing the variables that are pushing your body and your mind in the
directions that you don't want to go. Self experimentation is
something that should be done slowly, carefully, you don't want to be
reckless about this. And this is where I would say manipulating one or
two variables at a time is really going to be best as opposed to
changing of a dozen things all at once to really identify what it is
that's most powerful for you. As always, thank you so much for your
questions. We are going to continue to answer questions. I certainly
didn't get to all of them but we tried to get to most all of the ones
that were frequently asked. Episode four of the podcast, I'm going to
get into, shift work, jet lag and age dependent changes in sleeping
and wakefulness and cognition. So for those of you with kids, for
those of you that are kids for those of you with older relatives or
who might be older meaning probably when you start to get into late
'60, '70 and '80 is when there's some marked biological shifts in
temperature regulation and things that relate to sleep. And for those
of you that travel, we're going to talk about jet lag. The shift work
discussion might seem only relevant to those that work nights, but
actually that's not the case. Most people because of the way they're
interacting with devices are actually in a form of shift work now,
where the days are certainly not nine to five, the so-called banker's
hours, and then the lights are out at nine and they're asleep until
5:00 AM. Some people have that schedule, most people do not. So
episode four, we will go deeply into shift work, jet lag age dependent
changes in sleep alertness and cognition and I will touch back on a
few of your questions but don't think that if your question wasn't
answered during these office hours that we won't get to it, I
absolutely will at some point. In addition to that, several of you
have graciously asked how you can help support the podcast. And we
very much appreciate that. You can support the podcast by liking it on
YouTube, by subscribing on YouTube, by recommending the YouTube videos

out some of the sponsor links that were described at the beginning of
the episode. And in general, recommending the podcast to people that
you know and that you think would benefit from the information would
be terrific. As always I will be continuing to post on Instagram. You

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. (energetic music) I'm Andrew
Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast episode is all about
sleep, and we're also going to talk about the mirror image of sleep,
which is wakefulness. Now, these two phases of our life, sleep and
wakefulness, govern everything about our mental and physical health,
and we're not just gonna talk about what's useful about sleep, we're
also gonna talk about how to get better at sleeping, and that will
include how to get better at falling asleep, timing your sleep, and
accessing better sleep quality. In doing so, we're also gonna discuss
how to get more focused and alert in wakefulness, so because sleep and
wakefulness are related, we really can't have a conversation about one
without the other. Now, in keeping with this theme, you may catch a
few snores in the background. Unlike me, my bulldog, Costello, can
fall asleep anywhere, anytime, and he happens to be sleeping over
there in the corner, so if you hear snoring, that's what that's about.
As always, I wanna just mention that this podcast is part of my effort
to bring zero-cost-to-consumer public education about science and
science-related tools, it is unrelated to my teaching and research
roles at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast is brought to us
by Helix mattresses, having the proper sleep environment, both the
environment you're sleeping in and the object you're sleeping on, is
critically important to getting a good night's sleep. Helix mattresses
are a little different than most because they're matched to your
specific sleep needs, as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or
cold as you sleep through the night, what position you sleep in, and
so forth, so if you go to their website, they have a quiz that you can
take that matches you to the particular mattress that's gonna be best
for your sleep needs. I've always had a lot of trouble sleeping, I'm
one of these people that can fall asleep easily, but then I wake up
and I have a hard time getting back to sleep, and once I switched to a
Helix mattress that was precisely matched to my sleep needs, I found I
could sleep through the night, which has made a tremendous difference
for me. If you wanna try Helix mattresses, you can go to
helixsleep.com/huberman, and that will give you up to $200 off on a
mattress order, as well as two pillows free with your mattress order,
and of course, having the proper pillows is just as important as
having the proper mattress. Today's podcast is also brought to us by
Headspace, Headspace is a meditation app that teaches you how to
meditate. It's fair to say that now there's a ton of research out
there in peer-reviewed journals supporting the fact that mindfulness
meditation can support mental and physical health, but many people
find it hard to meditate, in fact, I'm one of these people. I started
meditating in my teens, but then I would drop it every few weeks or so
and then I'd get back to it maybe the following week or every year, I
just was not very regular about my meditation practice, and then a few
years ago I was flying a lot for work and I was on JetBlue flights,
and they have Headspace as part of the choice of things that you can
watch on the TV screen, and as I started meditating more regularly,
what I found is my sleep was better, I would arrive feeling more
rested, it was just a tremendous effects on my work performance and
other aspects of my life. If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to
headspace.com/specialoffer, if you do that, you'll get one month of
all of Headspace's meditations for free, that's the best offer right
now, so if interested, go to headspace.com/specialoffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=210"&gt;What Is Sleep Really For?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about sleep, sleep is this incredible period of our
lives where we are not conscious. We might dream, we might twitch, we
might even wake up, but in sleep, we are only in relation to things
that are happening within our brain and body. Outside sensory
experience, in most cases, can't really impact us, and yet, sleep is
this tremendously important period of life because it resets our
ability to be focused, alert, and emotionally stable in the wakeful
period, so we can't really talk about wakefulness, focus, motivation,
mood, wellbeing without thinking about sleep, and that's why we're
devoting this entire month to the discussion about sleep. Now, we also
can't talk about sleep and think about sleep without thinking about
wakefulness because it turns out that the period that we call sleep
and the period we call wakefulness are tethered to one another. What
we do in the waking state determines when we fall asleep, how quickly
we fall asleep, whether or not we stay asleep, and how we feel when we
wake up the next day, and today, we're going to talk mostly about how
to get better at sleeping, and the reason for starting the
conversation that way as opposed to just diving into a lot of biology
about sleep, is because first of all, there's a lot of information out
there already about the biology of sleep. We're gonna touch on a
little bit of this, things like stages of sleep and sleep spindles,
melatonin, and dreaming, but I think that by now, most people are
aware that getting a really good night's sleep on a consistent basis
is critically important, but most people don't know how to do that. In
fact, I'm guessing that very few of you out there are consistently
getting seven to nine hours of really terrific sleep, waking up
feeling rested and like you're ready to attack the day, and being able
to go through the day feeling focused and alert without dips in energy
or focus, so if you're like most people, which includes me, you have
some challenges with sleep at least every third or fifth night or so
and maybe even more often, so we're really gonna go tool-heavy today
and talk about tools that can help you fall asleep, sleep better, and
emerge from sleep feeling more rested, and we're gonna do that by
grounding our discussion of tools in peer-reviewed studies, mostly
from the last 10 years, although some even more recent than that, and
we're gonna start by discussing what is sleep and what governs the
timing of the onset of sleep, in other words, what makes you get
sleepy at a particular time of day. So what determines how well we
sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=375"&gt;Sleep Hunger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the quality of our wakeful state? Turns out that's governed by two
forces, the first force is a chemical force, it's called adenosine.
Adenosine is a molecule in our nervous system and body that builds up
the longer we are awake, so if you've just slept for 8, or 9, or 10
really deep, restful hours, adenosine is gonna be very low in your
brain and body. If, however, you've been awake for 10, 15, or more
hours, adenosine levels are going to be much higher. Adenosine creates
a sort of sleep drive or a sleep hunger, and actually, hunger is the
appropriate word here because for most of what we're gonna discuss
today, we can think of it in an analogous way to nutrition. Your
nutrition and how well you feel after you eat certain foods, your
overall level of fitness and your cellular health and your heart
health isn't governed by any one food item that you might eat or not
eat, it's governed by a number of different factors, how often you
eat, how much you eat, which items you eat, et cetera, and what works
best for you. In the same way, your sleep and your wakefulness are the
product of kind of the average of a number of different behaviors, how
long you've been awake is a key one because of this molecule,
adenosine. So the reason you get sleepy when you've been up for a
while is because adenosine is creeping up steadily the longer you've
been awake, and a good way to remember this and think about adenosine
is to think about caffeine. Caffeine, for most people, except a very
small percentage of people, wakes them up, it makes them feel more
alert, in fact, some people are so sensitive to caffeine that they
feel jittery if they drink it even in small amounts, other people can
drink large amounts of caffeine and not feel jittery at all. Caffeine
acts as an adenosine antagonist, what that means is that when you
ingest caffeine, whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea, or in any
other form, it binds to the adenosine receptor, it sort of parks there
just like a car would park in a given parking slot, and therefore,
adenosine can't park in that slot. Now, when caffeine parks in the
adenosine receptor slot, nothing really happens downstream of that
receptor, the receptor can't engage the normal cellular functions of
making that cell and you feel sleepy. So the reason caffeine wakes you
up is because it blocks the sleepiness receptor, it blocks the sleepy
signal, and this is why when that caffeine wears off, adenosine will
bind to that receptor, sometimes with even greater, what we call
affinity, and you feel the crash, you feel especially tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=540"&gt;Caffeine: Devil &amp;amp; Angel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm not here to demonize caffeine, I love caffeine, and I drink
it in the morning and I drink it in the afternoon, but I'm one of
these people that, either because of my tolerance or because of some
genetic variations that exist among people in terms of their adenosine
receptors, I can drink caffeine as late as 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. in the
evening and still fall asleep just fine. Some people can't have any
caffeine at all or can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m. or else
their sleep is totally disrupted. All of this has to do with the
relationship between adenosine and these adenosine receptors, genetic
variation, things that are very hard to find out except
experimentally, meaning each of you needs to decide and figure out for
yourselves whether or not you can tolerate caffeine and at what times
of day you can tolerate caffeine in order to still fall asleep easily
and get good sleep, so rather than demonize caffeine, or say that
everyone can drink caffeine until late, you need to figure out what's
right for you. Caffeine has a lot of health benefits, it also, for
some people, can be problematic for health, it can raise blood
pressure, et cetera, caffeine increases this molecule that's a
neuromodulator that we call dopamine, we discussed this in episode
one, which tends to make us feel good, motivated, and give us energy
because, as you may have learned in episode one, dopamine is related
to another neuromodulator called epinephrine, which gives us energy,
in fact, epinephrine is made from dopamine. So let's just take a step
back and think about what we're talking about when we're talking about
sleepiness, sleepiness is driven by increases in adenosine that happen
naturally, caffeine prevents the adenosine from having its action of
making us sleepy by blocking that receptor, so it gives us energy and
it increases our dopamine levels, but some people can't tolerate
caffeine very well, other people can tolerate it just fine, so you
need to determine that experimentally. All the data say there's
tremendous variation, and right now, the only way that I'm aware of
for you to decide whether or not caffeine is a good or a bad thing for
you, and whether or not you should ingest it at a given time of day or
at all is really to figure that out on your own, in fact, there's a
small subset of people that can drink caffeine until very late and
they have no trouble falling asleep because they actually have a
mutant form of the adenosine receptor, so in keeping with the theme of
science and science-related tools, this is one of those cases where I
can't give you a one-size-fits-all prescription except to say you need
to experiment with caffeine in a way that's safe for you and explore
that and figure out what works for you, and then stick with that.
Okay, so adenosine is driving this sleep hunger, when adenosine is
low, it's like we're well-fed, we're not very hungry, and when
adenosine is high, it's like we're fasted for a long time and we tend
to be very hungry, so that when adenosine is high, we really wanna
fall asleep. If you want, I'm not suggesting you do this experiment,
but you can do it, you can stay up for four more hours than you're
used to staying up and you'll find that you're very, very sleepy.
That's because adenosine is building up at levels higher and higher
because you've been awake for those extra four hours. However, if
you've ever pulled an all-nighter, you'll notice something
interesting, as morning rolls around, you'll suddenly feel an increase
in your energy and alertness again, even though adenosine has been
building up for the entire night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=740"&gt;Timing Your Sleep Properly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, why is that? The reason that is is because there's a second force
which is governing when you sleep and when you're awake, and that
force is a so-called circadian force, circadian means about a day or
about 24 hours, and inside all of us is a clock that exists in your
brain and my brain, and the brain of every animal that we're aware of,
that determines when we want to be sleepy and when we want to be
awake. Just think about it, we don't go through the day wanting to
fall asleep every 30 minutes and then feeling like we're wide awake,
our sleep and our period of sleepiness tends to be condensed into one
block, typically one 6- to 10-hour block, although there's also
variation in terms of how much people want to sleep, and we're going
to discuss how you can diagnose your absolute sleep need as well as
how to recover sleep that you've lost. That block of sleep and when it
falls within each 24-hour cycle is governed by a number of different
things, but the most powerful thing that's governing when you want to
be asleep and when you want to be awake is light, and in particular,
it's governed by sunlight, and I can't emphasize enough how important
and how actionable this relationship is between light and when you
want to sleep. It's quite simple on the face of it and it's quite
simple to resolve, but people tend to make a big mess of this whole
circadian literature, frankly, so let's just break it down from the
standpoint of what's going on in your brain and body as you go through
one 24-hour day. Let's start with waking, so regardless of how well
you slept at night or whether or not you were up all night, most
people tend to wake up sometime around when the sun rises, maybe not
right at sunrise, but within an hour or two or maybe three of sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=855"&gt;Release Your Hormones (At The Right Times)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I realize there are night-shift workers and there are people
traveling and experiencing jet lag where this is not going to be the
case, we are gonna deal with jet lag and shift work at the end of this
podcast, but for most people, we tend to wake up about the time that
the sun is rising or so, and as we do that, adenosine levels tend to
be low if we've been asleep for reasons that you now understand, and
our system generates an internal signal that is in the form of a
hormone. Now, I've talked a lot about neuromodulators and
neurotransmitters, I haven't talked a lot about hormones yet on this
podcast. The definition of a hormone is it's a substance, a chemical
that's released from one organ in your body that goes and acts on
other organs elsewhere in your body, including your nervous system.
When you wake up in the morning, you wake up because a particular
hormone called cortisol is released from your adrenal glands, your
adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys, and there's a little
pulse of cortisol. There's also a pulse of some, and when I say a
pulse, I just mean the release of a little bit, there's also a pulse
of epinephrine, which is adrenaline, from your adrenals and also in
your brain, and you feel awake. Now, that pulse of cortisol and
adrenaline and epinephrine might come from your alarm clock, it might
come from you naturally waking up, but it tends to alert your whole
system in your body that it's time to increase your heart rate, it's
time to start tensing your muscles, it's time to start moving about.
It's very important that that cortisol pulse come early in the day, or
at least, early in your period of wakefulness, I say that because some
people are waking up at 8:00 p.m. and are sleeping all day, but it's
very important that that pulse of cortisol occur early in the day and
that it happens all at once, it sort of sets a rising tide of cortisol
in your system. Now, many of you have probably heard about cortisol in
relation to stress, and indeed, as we go through our day and our life,
different stressors, different events happen in our life that make us
feel more alert. Some of the more stressful ones might be looking at
your credit card bill and seeing what seems to be a fraudulent charge,
or looking at your phone and suddenly seeing a text that something you
thought was gonna happen at a particular time is not gonna happen, or
you're running late, those will tend to increase norepinephrine and
epinephrine and adrenaline in your system, and if they're severe
enough, you'll start getting some pulses of cortisol released from
your adrenals throughout the day, but there's this normal, healthy
rising tide of cortisol that happens early in the day, and I say
healthy because it wakes you up, it makes you feel alert, and it makes
you feel able to move and wanting to move and to go about your day for
work, for exercise, for school, for social relations, et cetera. So
when you wake up in the morning is when that cortisol pulse takes off,
and something else important happens, a timer is set in your body and
in your nervous system that dictates when a different hormone called
melatonin, which makes you sleepy, will be secreted from a particular
brain region, so let's talk about that. When you wake up in the
morning and you experience that rise in cortisol, there's a timer that
starts going, and these are cellular timers and they're dictated by
the relation between different organs in your body, that says to your
brain and body that in about 12 to 14 hours, a different hormone, this
hormone we're calling melatonin, will be released from your pineal
gland. So there's two mechanisms here, a wakefulness signal and a
sleepiness signal, and the wakefulness signal triggers the onset of
the timer for the sleepiness signal. Now, that sleepiness signal that
we call melatonin that's released from the pineal comes only from the
pineal. Unless you're taking exogenous melatonin, you're supplementing
with melatonin, the only source of melatonin in your body is going to
be this pineal gland, so let's talk about the pineal gland for a
second. The pineal gland is a gland that sits kind of in the little
structure near, for the aficionados out there, it's kind of near the
fourth ventricle, it's about the size of a pea, Descartes, the
philosopher, said that the pineal was the seat of the soul, he said
that because it's one of the few structures in the human brain that
there's only one of them, you know, most structures, there's one on
either side of the brain, so-called bihemispheric, but the pineal,
there's only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=1125"&gt;(Pineal) Melatonin Warning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know anything about souls, really, certainly not the science
of souls, but I think it's very unlikely that the pineal is the seat
of the soul, but it is a very interesting organ because it's the only
organ in our body that releases melatonin, and that melatonin makes us
sleepy and lets us fall asleep. Now, I'm guessing that many of you are
probably asking, "Should I take melatonin?" My personal bias on this
is, except in rare cases, no, for the following reason, melatonin has
a second function, which is that melatonin also suppresses the onset
of puberty. In kids, and especially in babies, melatonin isn't just
released in the evening 12 to 16 hours after we wake, melatonin is
released chronically, or tonically, throughout the day and night, and
that chronic or tonic release of melatonin is known to suppress some
of the other hormones in other regions of the brain that trigger the
onset of puberty. Now, if you or your child has been taking melatonin,
don't freak out, as always, any kind of supplement or anything that
you're going to take or think about taking, you really need to consult
with your doctor, I've said this many times on this podcast and it's
in the show notes, et cetera, but before you remove anything or add
anything to what you're already doing, please do consult with a
healthcare professional. However, melatonin is known to suppress the
onset of puberty, so much so that regular, cyclic, cycled periods of
melatonin release from the pineal really correlate with the onset of
puberty and early adulthood, meaning as we start secreting melatonin
only at night, that's also when we tend to transition out of puberty.
Now, there are a lot of things that correlate in our nervous system,
so that doesn't necessarily mean it controls it, but in this case we
know, based on lots of data, endocrinology and so forth, that
melatonin suppresses the onset of puberty, so supplementing melatonin
could be problematic for that reason, but if you've already gone
through puberty, it could also have some impact on other hormone
systems in your body, so that's why I personally don't like to use
melatonin to fall asleep. There's another reason, which is that
melatonin will help you fall asleep but it won't help you stay asleep,
and many people who take melatonin find that they wake up three to
five hours later unable to fall back asleep. Part of the reason for
that might be that melatonin purchased at, you can buy it over the
counter in most areas of the world even though it's a hormone, which
is a little unusual, you can't just go into a pharmacy, at least in
the US, and buy testosterone or cortisol or estrogen, you need a
prescription, but you can go buy melatonin for whatever reason, I
don't know the reasons for that legality, but it's been shown many
times, and now I'm borrowing from some items that were in Matt
Walker's book, "Why We Sleep," where he stated there is evidence that,
in commercially available melatonin, the amount of melatonin has been
tested for various brands, it can range anywhere from being 15% of
what's listed on the bottle, okay, so if they list this as 100
milligrams, it would be a tremendously high dose, it turns out it's
only 15 milligrams in that particular pill or capsule, or up to 400
times more than what's listed on the bottle, so it's completely
unregulated, and so for those of you taking melatonin, I will discuss
at the end of the podcast some other potential alternatives that are
probably safer and don't have these issues. So should you take
melatonin? My personal bias is no, but for many people, they find that
it does help them, and so if you do find it helps you, then just
consider what I'm saying in light of the other practices that you're
doing and talk to your healthcare professional. Okay, so the rhythm of
cortisol and melatonin is what we call endogenous, it's happening in
us all the time without any external input, in fact, if we were in
complete darkness, living in a cave with no artificial lights
whatsoever, or we were in complete brightness where we never
experienced any darkness, these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin
would continue, you would have a bump in cortisol, or a pulse in
cortisol, that would drop off with time, and then melatonin would come
up about 12 to 14 hours later, but these endogenous systems of our
body, which are both hormonal and neural, were set so that external
things could govern when they happen. Now, this takes us back to
episode one of the podcast that if you haven't listened to already,
you might wanna listen to, where we talked about sensation and
perception and all that, I'm not gonna review it again here, but
there's one particular sensory event, one particular influence on your
nervous system that determines when that cortisol is going to start to
rise, so if you were in complete darkness, it would happen once per
24-hour cycle, but it would be somewhat later and later each day,
whereas under normal circumstances, what happens is you wake up, and
what happens when you wake up? You open your eyes. When your open your
eyes, light comes into your eyes. Now, the way this system works is
that you have a particular set of neurons in your eye, they're called
retinal ganglion cells, you don't have to remember that if you don't
want to, but these retinal ganglion cells are brain neurons, again,
the retina is just the one piece of your brain, actually, two pieces
because most of you have two retinas, that resides outside the skull,
per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=1470"&gt;Strange Vision Is Good Vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When light comes into the eye, there's a particular group of retinal
ganglion cells, or type of retinal ganglion cells, that perceives a
particular type of light and communicates that to this clock that
resides right above the roof of your mouth called the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, okay? So I know this can get a little complicated, but these
retinal ganglion cells, when you open your eyes, light comes in, and
an electrical signal is sent to this central clock we call the
suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus has
connections with essentially every cell and organ of your body. Now,
it's vitally important that we get light communicated to this central
clock in order to time the cortisol and melatonin properly, and when I
say properly, I can say that with confidence because we know based on
a lot of evidence that if you don't get your cortisol and melatonin
rhythms right, there are tremendously broad and bad effects on
cardiovascular health, dementia, metabolic effects, learning,
depression, dementia, in fact, there're so many negative effects
associated with getting this wrong that I don't wanna get into it in
too much detail, in fact, I feel like we've been bombarded with all
this information about how we're not sleeping well, we're not sleeping
at the right times, we're not sleeping enough, to the point where
people now have sleep anxiety, if they can't sleep well for a night,
they're feeling overwhelmed by that and it's sort of now they're
stressed about not being able to sleep which is making it harder to
sleep, et cetera. I really wanna focus on what we can do to anchor
these systems properly, so let's think about what happens when we do
this correctly and how to do it correctly. When we wake up, our eyes
open, now, if we're in a dark room, there isn't enough light to
trigger the correct timing of this cortisol-melatonin thing, these
rhythms. You might say, "Well, why won't any light do it?" Well, it
turns out that these neurons in our eye that set the circadian clock
and then allow our circadian clock to set all the clocks of all the
cells and organs and tissues of our body responds best to a particular
quality of light and amount of light, and those are the qualities of
light and amount of light that come from sunlight, so these neurons,
what they're really looking for, although they don't have a mind of
their own, is the sun at what we call low solar angle, the eye and the
nervous system don't know anything about sunrises or sunsets, it only
knows the quality of light that comes in when the sun is low in the
sky, the system evolved so that when the sun is low in the sky,
there's a particular contrast between yellows and blues that triggers
the activation of these cells, so if you wake up and you look at your
phone or your computer, or you flip on a bunch of artificial lights,
will these cells be activated? And the answer is, sort of, they'll be
activated but not in the optimal way. What you want to do is get
sunlight in your eyes as close to waking as possible. Now, I wanna be
really clear about this because I've talked about it on other podcasts
when I was a guest and I talked about it on my Instagram feed, and
there seemed to be the same questions coming up again and again, these
neurons don't know sunlight, per se, they don't know sunrise or
sunset, for that matter, they don't know artificial light from
sunlight, what they respond best to, however, is the quality and
amount of light that comes in when the sun is low in the sky, that
means that if you can watch the sunrise, great, that's perfect for
triggering activation of these cells, however, if you wake up a few
hours after the sunrise, which I tend to most days, personally, you
still wanna get outside and view sunlight, you don't need the sunlight
beaming you directly in the eyes, there's a lot of photons, light
energy, that's scattered from sunlight at this time, but the key is to
get that light energy, from sunlight, ideally, into your eyes. Now, I
know many of you are already asking, "Well, I live in Scandinavia,"
or, "I can't get sunlight, "there's buildings around me," et cetera,
we will get to all of that, but it's critically important that you get
outside to get this light. I had a discussion with a colleague of
mine, Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in the Department of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, a world expert in this, and he tells
me that it's 50 times less effective to view this sunlight through a
window, through a car windshield, or through the side window of a car
than it is to just get outside with no sunglasses and view light early
in the day. Now, if you can't see the sunrise, like I said, you can
see this within an hour or two of sunrise, but it has to be low solar
angle, once the sun is overhead, the quality of light shifts so that
you miss this opportunity to time the cortisol pulse, and that turns
out to be a bad thing to do, you really wanna time that cortisol pulse
properly because, we'll get into this a little bit more later, but a
late-shifted cortisol pulse, in particular, a 9:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m.
increase in cortisol is one of the consequences, and maybe one of the
causes, of a lot of anxiety disorders and depression, so it's kind of
a chicken-egg thing, we don't know whether or not it's correlated
with, it's the cause, or the effect, but it's a signature of
depression and anxiety disorder. Bringing that cortisol pulse earlier
in your wakeful period, earlier in your day, has positive benefits
ranging from blood pressure to mental health, et cetera, not gonna
list them all off because there's just so many of them, but many, many
positive things happen when you are getting the cortisol early in the
day far away from your melatonin pulse. Okay, so how long should you
be outside? Well, this is gonna vary tremendously because some people
live in environments where it's very bright, so let's say it's
Colorado in the middle of winter, there's a snowfield, there's no
cloud cover, and you walk outside, there's going to be so much photon
light energy arriving on your retina that it probably only takes 30 to
60 seconds to trigger the central clock and set your cortisol and
melatonin rhythms properly and get everything lined up nicely, whereas
if you're in Scandinavia in the depths of winter and you wake up at
5:00 a.m. and the sun is just barely creeping across the horizon and
then goes back down again a few hours later, you probably are not
getting enough sunlight in order to set these rhythms, so many people
find that they need to use sunlight simulators in the form of
particular lights that were designed to simulate sunlight, however,
and I'm not out to attack the companies that produce those, there's
another solution to that, you can simply go outside for longer, even
if there's a lot of dense cloud cover, you're probably getting
anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 lux, L-U-X, which is just a measure of
light energy, and that should be sufficient to set the circadian
clock. You could say, "Well, the lights in my house or my phone "are
really, really bright, right? "Everyone's telling us to stay off our
phones at night "because they're really bright," but guess what, it
turns out that early in the day, your retina is not very sensitive,
which means you need a lot of photons, ideally coming from sunlight,
to set these clock mechanisms, so looking at your phone or artificial
lights is fine if you wake up before sunrise, but it's not going to
work to set these clock mechanisms, and this is supported by dozens,
if not hundreds, of quality peer-reviewed studies, so you wanna use
sunlight, if you can't see sunlight because of your environment, then
you are going to have to opt for artificial light, and in that case,
you're going to want an artificial light that either simulates
sunlight or has a lot of blue light. Now, without going off course
here, you might be saying, "Wait, I've heard blue light is bad for
me." Actually, blue light is great for this mechanism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=1970"&gt;Blue Light Is Great!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;during the day, we can talk about blue light and blue blockers, but
you really want a lot of blue and yellow light arriving on the retina
early in the day. Let me be clear about something, you never ever want
to look at any light, sunlight or artificial light, that is painful to
look at. If you find that your eyes are watering or you're having
challenges maintaining, you know, looking at this thing for a while
because it's painful, that light is too bright and you do not wanna
damage your retina, so you don't wanna gaze at the sun refusing to
blink and burn your retina, that's actually possible to do, you don't
wanna do that. You have a proper blink reflex installed in you since
birth, and if you feel like something's too bright and you need to
blink, it means you need to blink, that it's too much light, so please
don't beam your eyes with really bright light, but blue light, in
particular, blue light and yellow light coming from sunlight is ideal,
if you're going to get it from artificial light because you can't get
enough sunlight, well, then, artificial lights that are rich in blue,
blue wavelengths, are going to be ideal for setting this mechanism. A
lot of people will say, "Oh, I should be "wearing blue blockers
throughout the day." No, that's the exact wrong thing, if you're going
to use blue blockers, we can talk about that, that should be reserved
for late in the evening because light suppresses melatonin. I've been
asked many times before about this pineal gland and there are a lot of
ancient practices that map to some of the things that I'm saying, and
people will always say, "Oh, I heard that sunlight "is great for the
pineal." Well, perhaps, but we have to careful about that phrase,
sunlight inhibits the pineal, it prevents it from releasing melatonin,
darkness allows the pineal to release melatonin, so the pineal is not
the gland or the organ of sunlight, it is the gland of darkness, in
fact, melatonin can be thought of as a sleepiness signal that's
correlated with darkness, so get up each morning, try and get outside,
I know that can be challenging for people, but anywhere from 2 to 10
minutes of sunlight exposure is going to work well for most people,
and you wanna do this on a regular basis and you don't have to do it
exactly at sunrise, I realize I'm repeating myself, but somehow,
despite barking at people about this for a couple years now, I keep
getting the same questions, and somehow, it hasn't been sinking in,
which could be related to some circadian disorder, I'm just kidding,
if it's not sinking in, it's probably that I'm not being effective in
communicating the information, but get that bright light early in the
day from sunlight, and if you can't get it from sunlight, get it from
artificial light. What kinds of artificial lights will work? Well,
there are these sunrise simulators, but the ring lights that people
use for selfies and this sort of thing, for posting on Instagram,
those generate a lot of blue light. If wanna get experimental about
this, there's a free app, I have no relationship to the app, but it's
a great app called Light Meter that you can use your phone and you can
measure the amount of photon energy in your environment, and it's kind
of a fun experiment to do, you can go outside in the morning and
you'll see that there's 10,000, 20,000 lux, even though it might seem
like it's kinda dim or there's tree cover or cloud cover, you go
inside and you shine an artificial light at your phone, press the
button on Light Meter and you'll find that it's only 500 or 1,000 lux,
and you realize that even though it seems really bright, the
artificial light is very condensed, whereas the outside light is
scattered in the atmosphere, and so you can think that you're not
getting much sunlight but you're actually getting much more outside,
so get outside, get that sunlight early in the day, and try and do it
on a consistent basis. If you can't do it every day or you sleep
through this period of the early day, low solar angle, don't worry
about it, these systems in the body, these hormone systems and
neurotransmitter systems that make you awake at certain periods of the
day and sleepy at other times are operating by averaging when you view
the brightest light. Now, that can immediately tell us that what most
people are doing is terrible, they're waking up and they're looking at
their phone, which isn't triggering activation of these cells in the
eye and the central circadian clock, then a few hours later, they
might get in their car with sunglasses and drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=2220"&gt;The Real Problem With Smartphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a note about sunglasses and prescription lenses, absolutely
never, ever, ever compromise safety for the sorts of things I'm
talking about, so if you need to wear sunglasses for safety reasons,
wear them, absolutely, if you wear prescription lenses or contacts,
wear them, they won't filter out the wavelengths of light that are
necessary for setting these central clocks, so safety first, of
course, if you have a retinal degenerative disorder, retinitis
pigmentosa, macular degeneration, or glaucoma, or those run in your
family, you want to avoid excessively bright light all the time, you
wanna be very cautious about that, you're going to wanna get your
light exposure through seeing dimmer light, including sunlight, but
for longer periods of time, perhaps. You might immediately ask, "What
about low-vision or blind people, "how do they set these central
clocks?" Well, turns out that low-vision and blind people, most of
them, provided they still have eyes, that the eyes weren't removed
because of a burn or a tumor or something like that, still maintain
these neurons that set the circadian clock, which brings me to a
really important point, it's not about seeing and perceiving the sun,
this is a subconscious mechanism by which these neurons, which are
called melanopsin ganglion cells, these neurons set your central
clocks by getting activated by the particular wavelengths of light
that are present in the atmosphere, even coming through cloud cover,
and you don't need to see or perceive the sun in order to get this
mechanism to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=2310"&gt;Blind / Low Vision People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it's such a vitally important mechanism because it dictates how
well and what time you will want to fall asleep later in the day, so
for those of you that are night owls and you insist that you're a
night owl and you have the genetic polymorphism that makes you a night
owl, you may very well have that genetic polymorphism, those genes
that make you want to stay up late and wake up late, but chances are,
about half of you that think that you're night owls are just not
getting enough sunlight early in the day. So viewing light early in
the day, ideally sunlight, is key for establishing healthy sleep-wake
rhythms and for allowing you to fall asleep easily at night. Now, it's
not gonna make sure that all that happens every single time, but it is
the foundation of proper sleep and what we call circadian health, it
governs metabolism and so many other things that are supposed to exist
on a regular 24-hour cycle. Some of you, many of you, might be asking,
"What else can help set this rhythm?" Well, it turns out that light is
what we call the primary zeitgeber, the time giver, but other things
can help establish this rhythm of cortisol followed by melatonin 12 to
16 hours later as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=2385"&gt;Using Exercise &amp;amp; Food To Set Your Clock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other things besides light are timing of food intake, timing of
exercise, as well as various drugs or chemicals that one might ingest,
not illegal drugs, although those will impact circadian mechanisms as
well, but the reason we focus so heavily on light is that light is the
main way that this central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, was
supposed to be set, and we know that because it's the only direct
input to the clock. These neurons in the eye that are also part of the
brain that we call melanopsin ganglion cells that, not so
incidentally, were discovered by my friend and colleague David Berson
at Brown University, and others, Samer Hattar, King-Wai Yau, et
cetera, worked out the mechanisms, the molecular mechanisms, but it
was really David Berson that discovered these incredibly fascinating,
you know, these are cells that aren't important for sight like pattern
vision, but are for setting our clocks, David's really credited with
making that discovery. Those cells are the main way and the only
direct way to set the clock, in fact, it's fair to say that light
viewed by these melanopsin cells, in particular, sunlight, is 1,000 to
10,000 times more effective than, say, getting up in darkness and just
exercising. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't exercise early in the
day in darkness if that's what you like to do, it will have somewhat
an effect on raising your wakefulness early in the day and setting
these rhythms, and this is because of some other pathways, for the
aficionados out there who wanna know more neuroscience, here's how it
goes, you've got this clock above the roof of your mouth that churns
out this 24-hour rhythm and it's communicated to all the other organs
and tissues of your body, but there's another structure, it has a cool
name, it's called the intergeniculate leaflet, which sits a few
millimeters away in the brain, and it's involved in regulating the
clock output through what's called non-photic, non-light-type
influences like exercise and feeding, et cetera. So if you are not
feeling awake during the day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=2520"&gt;The Power of Sunset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you're having trouble sleeping, get the sunlight exposure that we
just talked about, but in addition to that, if you wanna become an
early riser, for instance, and you wanna feel more awake during the
early part of the day, by getting that light exposure and exercising
early in the day, you will, after two or three days, you will
naturally start to wake up earlier in the day, and that's because
these clock mechanisms have shifted, it's like setting the clock
earlier as opposed to delaying the clock, and that takes us to a
somewhat complicated, but very important, aspect to all this, which
is, what sets the clock and keeps it anchored? The main thing is that
bright light early in the day, the other thing is sunset, when the sun
is also at low solar angle, low, close to the horizon, by viewing
sunlight at that time of day in the evening, or afternoon, depending
on what time of year it is and where you are in the world, these
melanopsin cells, these neurons in your eye, signal the central
circadian clock that it's the end of the day, and there's a really
nice study that was published last year, and I will put links to these
references on a website not too long from now, there was a really nice
study that showed that viewing sunlight around the time of the sunset,
doesn't have to be just crossing the horizon, but circa sunset, within
an hour or so of sunset, prevents some of the bad effects of light in
preventing melatonin release later that same night, so let me repeat
this, viewing light early in the day is key, viewing light later in
the day when the sun is setting, or around that time, can help protect
these mechanisms, your brain and body, against the negative effects of
light later in the day, so let me talk about you would do that, you'd
go view the sunset or you would go outside in the late afternoon or
evening, again, if you safely can do that with sunglasses off, you
will, if you need to wear sunglasses, fine, but it will take probably
100 to 1,000 times longer with dark sunglasses than if you take them
off, again, if you wanna do this through a window at work, that's
fine, but it'll take 50 times longer, so the best thing to do is just
to get outside for a few minutes, anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes, also
in the afternoon. Having those two signals arriving to your central
clock that your body, your internal world, knows when it's morning and
knows when it's evening, is tremendously powerful. Maybe think about
it this way, every cell in your body needs glucose and energy, it
needs, whether or not it gets that from meats or it gets it from
ketones or it gets it from carbohydrates or fruit or vegetables, it
doesn't matter, it is eventually converted into a certain form of
energy that all your cells use, but you don't take glucose, you don't
take bread or a steak or a nice orange and shove it in your ear, you
put it in your mouth, it goes into your stomach, it's digested, and
then that resource is distributed to all the cells of your body. Every
cell in your body needs oxygen, and you don't put a hose you know,
through your nostril or through your ear or through some other orifice
in your body, you inhale air and it's then distributed via the lungs
to the cells in your blood stream, and then it's distributed to all
the organs of your body. Every cell and organ in your body needs light
information, and the way to get that light information to all those
cells, because you have a thick skull and the inside of you is dark
inside your skin, there's no sunlight getting in there, is by viewing
sunlight with your eyes at the two times of day that I'm referring to,
okay? That's the only route. There was a study published in "Science,"
an excellent journal, well over 10 years ago, that showed that light
shone on the back of the knee could set these circadian rhythms, that
study was retracted, and unfortunately, most people don't know that it
was retracted, there were some experimental flaws, that people were
actually viewing light through their eyes. That study was repeated,
turns out, there is no extraocular photo reception in humans. Whatever
somebody tells you that light to the skin or light to the wherever is
beneficial for your health, we can talk about that, but there's no way
that light information is setting your clocks, you need these cells in
your eyes to perceive or to see light at the particular times of day
that I'm referring to. Some animals, like snakes and other reptiles,
actually have a hole in the top of their skull to get light
information directly to their pineal to suppress melatonin. We don't
have that hole, I mean, most of you don't have holes in your skull.
These holes in your skull that we call the sockets for the eyes are
actually there primarily to allow light information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=2803"&gt;The Healthy Holes In Your Skull&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to this central clock, and then vision and pattern vision and color
vision came much later in evolution, we know this on the basis of
genetic studies we get to discuss in a future podcast. So get that
light information to the cells of your brain and body by viewing
sunlight at the two times of day that I referred to. There's always a
lot of questions about, "How long, how much, how do I know if I've had
enough?" You'll know because your rhythm will start to fall into some
degree of normalcy, you'll start to wake up at more or less the same
time each day, you'll fall asleep more easily at night, generally, it
takes about two or three days for these systems to align, so if you've
not been doing these behaviors, it's gonna take a few days, but they
can have tremendous benefits, and sometimes rather quickly, on a
number of different mental and physical aspects of your health. Now
let's talk about the bad effects of light because light is not
supposed to arrive in our system at any time, and nowadays, because of
screens and artificial light, we have access to light at times of day
and night that normally we wouldn't. Now, earlier I said that you need
a lot of light, in particular, sunlight, to set these clock
mechanisms, that's true, but there's a kind of diabolical feature to
the way all of this works, which is the longer you've been awake, the
more sensitive your retina and these cells are to light, so that if
you've been awake for 10, 12, 14 hours, it becomes very easy for even
a small amount of light coming from a screen or from an overhead light
to trigger the activation of the clock and make you feel like you
wanna stay up later, make it harder to fall asleep, and disrupt your
sleep pattern, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=2895"&gt;Bad Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the simple way to think about this is you want as much light as is
safely possible early in the day, morning and throughout the day,
including blue light, so take those blue blockers off during the day
unless you have a real issue with screen light sensitivity, and you
want as little light coming into your eyes, artificial or sunlight,
after, say, 8:00 p.m., and certainly, you do not want to get bright
light exposure to your eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., and
here's why, David Berson, who I mentioned before, and another and
friend and colleague, Samer Hattar, who's director of the
chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of Mental Health
published a paper in "Cell," which is a journal, another excellent
journal, very high stringency, showing that light that arrives to the
eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., approximately, suppresses the
release of dopamine, this neuromodulator that makes us feel good, and
it's sort of an endogenous antidepressant, and can inhibit learning
and create all sorts of other detrimental effects, it does this
through a mechanism, for those of you that wanna know the neural
pathways, that involves light to the eyes that's then signaled to a
structure called the habenula, the habenula looks like two little bat
ears sitting right in the middle of a structure in your brain called
the thalamus, don't worry about these names if you're not interested
in this stuff, if you are, these are just avenues to explore, when
that habenula gets activated it's actually called the disappointment
nucleus because it actually makes us feel less happy and more
disappointed, and can lead to certain forms of depression in the
wakeful state. Now, if you wake up in the middle of the night and you
need to use the bathroom or you're on an all-night flight and you're,
you know, need to read or whatever it is, fine, every once in a while,
it's not gonna be a problem to get bright light exposure to your eyes
in the middle of the night, but if you think about our lifestyle
nowadays and being up late looking at phones, even if you dim that
screen, you're triggering this activation because your retinal
sensitivity and the sensitivity of these neurons has gone up late in
the day. Now, I'm not here to dictate what you should or shouldn't do,
but for those of you that are experiencing challenges with mood, those
of you that have anxiety, learning problems, issues focusing, the
questions I usually get are, "How can I focus better?" Well, we will
get to that, but one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms
for good mood, mental health, learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera,
is to take control of this light exposure behavior at night and not
get much or any bright light exposure in the middle of the night. Red
light won't trigger this pathway, but very few people have the kind of
infrared lights that are set up, or floor lights, and that brings me
to an important point, which is about the location of light, this
hasn't been discussed much out there, I don't think,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=3071"&gt;Light Location&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these cells in our eye, these neurons that signal the central clock,
reside mostly, not exclusively, but mostly, in the bottom half of our
retina, and because we have a lens in front of our retina, and because
of the optics of lenses, that means that these cells are actually
viewing our upper visual field, there's an inversion of the visual
image, et cetera, you can look that up if you wanna learn more about
retinal optics, it's fascinating, but not the topic for today. These
cells are in the bottom half of your retina mostly, and so they're
viewing the overhead visual space around you. This is probably not
coincidental that these cells were essentially designed to detect
sunlight, which is overhead, of course, so if you want to avoid
improper activation of these neurons, it's better to place lights that
you use in the evening low in your physical environment, so on
desktops or even the floor, if you wanna go that way, as opposed to
overhead lights, so overhead florescent lights would be the worst,
that would be the worst case scenario, lights that are overhead that
are a little bit softer, of the sort or yellow or reddish tints, would
be slightly better, but dim lights that are set low in the room are
going to be best because they aren't going to activate these neurons
and therefore shift your circadian clock, so that's a goal. Some
people, like Samer Hattar that I mentioned earlier, he turns his home
basically into a cave in the evenings. Candlelight actually does not
trigger activation of these cells, so candlelight and fireplaces and
campfires are fine, dim lights, very dim lights are fine, and lights
low in the physical environment, of course, the problem with
candlelight and fireplaces is the fire hazard, but you're smart
people, you know what to do about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=3180"&gt;Fire / Candlelight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't burn down whatever structure you're in, including forests,
please. So, keep the lights low in in your environment. What if you
wake up in the middle of the night and you find yourself watching TV
or on the computer? Well, in that case, you might wanna wear blue
blockers, and you certainly would wanna dim the screen, but ideally,
you're not doing that, it's remarkable the positive effects of getting
that bit of sunlight early in the day, maybe even also around sunset,
and avoiding bright lights, and especially overhead bright lights,
between about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.. Now, I'm not talking about
shift work, I'm realizing that we're probably gonna have to have an
entire discussion devoted just to shift workers because there's some
good information there about how they can protect themselves against
some of the very bad health effects of shift work, of getting light in
the middle of the night, but we rely on shift workers and they're
super important to culture and society and the economy, so I wanna
acknowledge them and let you know that we will do a discussion about
shift work and jet lag, but let's talk about what light can do in
terms of shifting us in healthy ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=3240"&gt;When To Eat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the way to think about this whole system, again, is you've got
adenosine building up depending on how long you've been awake and it's
making you sleepy, and then you've got the circadian mechanisms that
are timing your wakefulness and timing when you wanna be asleep,
mainly through cortisol and melatonin, but there are a bunch of other
things that are downstream of cortisol and melatonin, like, we tend to
be hungrier during our wakeful period than late at night, some people
like to eat late at night, but if you're finding that you can't become
a day person or a morning person, shifting your light exposure,
exercise, and food intake to the daytime will help. Some people like
to stop eating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m. because of metabolic reasons
or they're trying to maintain their weight or lose weight, that's
actually not supported so well by the literature, the literature
around nutrition essentially says that it's best to restrict your
feeding to a certain period of each 24-hour cycle to not be eating
around the clock, and whether or not that's 4 hours or 8 hours or 16
hours is a much lengthier discussion than we have time for now, I
would refer you to Satchin Panda's book, "The Circadian Code," which
talks all about that, he's an expert, a former colleague of mine from
the Salk Institute in San Diego, you can explore intermittent and
circadian fasting, so to speak, through Satchin's literature, we'll
talk about that, we might even get Satchin in here if we're lucky at
some point in the future, but you can actually use light to wake up
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=3340"&gt;How To Wake Up Earlier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues did a beautiful study showing that, if
you turn on the lights before waking up, so around 45 minutes to an
hour before waking up, even if your eyelids are closed, provided
you're not under the covers, after doing that for a few days, that
increases your total sleep time and shifts forward the time at which
you feel sleepy, it makes you want to go to bed earlier each night.
Now, in a kind of diabolical way, they did this with teenagers who are
notorious for wanting to wake up late and stay up late, and what they
found was bright light flashes, just turning on the lights in their
environment, overhead lights, because they're trying to activate this
system and that's why they're using overhead lights, even through the
eyelids, before these kids woke up, then made those kids naturally
wanna go to bed earlier and they ended up sleeping longer, so that's
something you could try, you could put your lights on a timer to go on
early in the day before you wake up, you could open your blinds so
that sunlight is coming through, and again, if you curl up under the
covers, then it's not gonna reach these neurons, but it's remarkable
that light can actually penetrate the eyelids, activate these neurons,
and go to the central clock. That study illustrates a really important
principle of how you're built, which is, you have the capacity for
what are called phase advances and phase delays, and I don't wanna
complicate this too much, so the simplest way to think about phase
advances and phase delays is that if you see light late in the day,
and in particular, in the middle of the night, your brain and body,
for reasons that now you understand, will think that that's morning
light even though it's not sunlight because you have this heightened
sensitivity, and it will phase delay, it will delay your clock, it
will essentially make you want to get up later and go to sleep later,
so if you get light exposure too late in the evening or in the middle
of the night, it's going to make it hard to want to wake up that next
morning early and to go to bed early. The opposite is also true, if
you wake up early, say, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m., and get light
exposure, or even earlier, 4:00 a.m., and get light exposure, it will
phase-advance your clock, okay? It's gonna make your clock think it's
earlier and you'll wanna wake up earlier, so the simple way to think
about this is if you're having trouble waking up early and feeling
alert early in the day, you're going to wanna try and get bright light
exposure even before waking up because it will advance your clock,
it's sort of like turning the clock forward, whereas if you are having
trouble waking up early, you definitely don't want to get too much
light exposure or any light exposure to your eyes late in the evening
and in the middle of the night because it's just gonna delay your
clock more and more, so rather than get into the specifics of
everybody's situation because there are many of you out there with
different situations and lifestyle requirements, et cetera, the way to
think about this is that you have these internal mechanisms of
adenosine and circadian clocks, and they're always operating, and what
you're trying to do is provide them anchors, you're trying to provide
them consistent, powerful anchors so that your cortisol, your
melatonin, and then everything that cascades down from that, like your
metabolism and your ability to learn and your sense of alertness, your
dopamine, your serotonin, all that stuff is timed regularly, one of
the reasons why there's so much challenge out there with focus and
anxiety and depression, there are a lot of reasons for that, but one
of the reasons is that people's internal mechanisms aren't anchored to
anything regular. Now, this doesn't require being neurotically
attached to getting up at a very specific time, going outside, viewing
the sunlight at the same time every day, these systems, again, will
average, but if you can provide them consistent light anchors early in
the day and in the evening, and avoiding light at night, you will be
amazed at the tremendous number of positive effects that can come from
that at the level of metabolic factors, hormones, and just general
feelings of wellbeing, in fact, most of us are familiar with what it
is to not sleep well and all the terrible effects that has, maybe one
night you're fine, two nights even, for the new parents out there, I
sympathize with you, but most people are not familiar with what it is
to sleep really, really well on a consistent basis, and when you start
doing that by controlling your sleep environment, right, get the
proper sleep surface, get the proper pillow, get the temperature in
the room right, get your light exposure right, start timing your
exercise at normal periods or times throughout the day and week, it's
amazing how many other biological systems just naturally fall in line,
and this is why whenever people ask me, "What should I take?" which is
one of the most common questions I get, "What supplement should I
take? "What drug should I be taking? "What things should I be taking?"
The first question I always ask them is, "How's your sleep?" and 90%
of the time, they tell me they either have trouble falling asleep or
staying asleep or they don't feel rested throughout the day. A brief
note about naps, naps, provided that they're less than one ultradian
cycle, provided they're 20 minutes or 30 minutes or even an hour, can
be very beneficial for a lot of people, you don't have to take them,
but many people naturally feel a dip in energy and focus late in the
afternoon, in fact, if we were gonna look at wakefulness, what we
would find is that you get that morning light exposure, hopefully,
your cortisol goes up, people will start feeling awake, and then
around two, or three, or four in the afternoon, there's a spike in
everything from alertness to ability to learn, some metabolic factors
drop, and then it just naturally comes back up, and then it tapers off
as the night goes on. So for some of you, naps are great, I love
taking naps, some people, they wake up from naps feeling really
groggy, that's probably because they're not sleeping as well as they
should at night or as long as they should at night, and so they're
dropping into REM sleep or deeper forms of sleep in the day time, and
then they wake up and they feel kind of disoriented, other people feel
great after a nap, so that's another case where, just like with
caffeine, so sort of have to evaluate for yourself. As we discuss
this, you're probably realizing this is a lot like nutrition where
nowadays it's just crazy, I mean, if you go on social media, it's like
you've got people who are pushing carnivore, you've got other people
who are pushing vegan, other people who are pushing paleo, every
variation of every diet, and there's a lot of data to support any and
all of those and the arguments go on and on, and there's probably a
lot of genetic variation and lifestyle variation that's going to
dictate whether or not something is good for you, whether or not you
like it, whether or not you'll stick to it. The same thing is true for
circadian and sleep and wakefulness behaviors, except the light-
viewing behavior that I talked about before, there's no way around
that, that's hardwired into our system, the same way we could
factually say that everybody needs some nutrition at some level from
some source, everybody needs light information arriving in their
system in some way at regular intervals, so that's really what this is
about. Okay, so naps are gonna be good for some people, not for
others, I have a colleague, a very accomplished neuroscientist, who
likes to take naps just after lunch, I personally like to take a nap
around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., but there's a practice that I've adopted in
the last 5 years that I've found to be immensely beneficial that is
sort of like napping but isn't napping, it's a thing that they call
yoga nidra, yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep, and it's a sort of
meditation that you listen to, there are number of scripts, I've
talked about this on podcasts before but I'm going to post a link to
the two that I like most, that allows you to consciously bring your
entire body and mind into a state of deep relaxation, and sometimes
you fall asleep and sometimes you don't, this is done for 10 to 30 or
even 60 minutes at a time. The other thing that works really well is
meditation, so I'm talking about naps, but I'm also talking about yoga
nidra, which is sort of a form of meditation, and then more standard
forms of meditation, all three of those do something powerful which is
that they bring our mind into a state of less so-called sympathetic
nervous system activation, go back and listen to episode one if that
doesn't make any sense, which is what governs your alertness, and
instead, it activates cells and circuits in your body that promote the
parasympathetic nervous system, or the calming system. A lot of people
are not good falling asleep because they're not good at calming down,
so some people have no trouble falling asleep, but many people have a
hard time falling asleep, or at least every once in a while experience
challenges falling asleep. I don't have problems falling asleep most
nights, but I've noticed that if I'm working very hard or if the world
is particularly stressful, my mind gets into a bit of a kind of OCD
loop where I tend to ruminate on things, and I'm not even thinking
about anything in particular, it's just challenging for me to
disengage and fall asleep. Meditation and yoga nidra scripts have been
immensely helpful for me in terms of accelerating the transition to
sleep, so they involve taking a few minutes, 10 to 30 minutes or so,
just like you would for a nap, and just listening to a script, almost
passively, and it has you do some particular patterns of breathing and
some other kind of body-scan-like things that can really help people
learn to relax, not just in that moment, but get better at relaxing
and turning off thinking in order to fall asleep when they wanna do
that at night. There's another thing that's similar to this, which is
certain forms of hypnosis for sleep, for that, I'll just refer you to
the website of a colleague and collaborator of mine, David Spiegel,
who's our associate chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at
Stanford, he's developed a website, which is reverie, R-E-V-E-R-I-E,
health.com, so reveriehealth.com, that has a lot of science-supported,
clinically supported hypnosis scripts that essentially take the brain
into states of deep relaxation for the sake of rewiring the brain and
neuroplasticity, but one of those scripts that's there and is
available free is for sleep, and we'll talk more about hypnosis at a
later time because it has a ton of other effects that aren't just
limited to sleep. So a period of time each day that you devote to
getting better at falling and staying asleep is actually a really good
practice to adopt. The other thing about these practices like
meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis, is people would always say to
me, "Well, when should I do them?" and I always say, "Well, the best
time of day to do it "is when you first wake up in the morning,
"provided you've gotten your sunlight already, "anytime you wake up in
the middle of the night, "or any time of day." In other words, they're
always good for you because it's a training mechanism by which you
self-train your nervous system to go from a state of heightened
alertness that you don't want to heightened relaxation that you do
want, and so it's really teaching you to hit the brake, and that
brings us to an even more important point, perhaps, which is, we've
all experienced that we can stay up if we want to, right? If we wanna
stay up late on New Year's or we wanna push an all-nighter, some
people can do that more easily than others, but we're all capable of
doing that, but it's very hard to make ourselves fall asleep, and so
there's a sort of asymmetry to the way our autonomic nervous system,
which governs this alertness-calmness thing, the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system, there's an asymmetry there where we
are more easily able to engage wakefulness and drive wakefulness, we
can force ourselves to stay awake, than we are able to force ourselves
to fall asleep, and one of the things that I say over and over again,
and I'm gonna continue to say over and over again, is it's very hard
to control the mind with the mind, when you have trouble falling
asleep, you need to look to some mechanism that involves the body, and
all the things I described, meditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra, all
involve exhale-emphasized breathing, certain ways of lying down and
controlling the body, we're gonna get into breathing in real depth at
another time, but all of those involve using the body to control the
mind rather than trying to, you know, wrestle your mind into a certain
pattern of relaxation, so earlier in episode one, I talked about the
Mobius strip, this continuous loop that is the brain-body
relationship, or the mind-body relationship, and when we're having
trouble controlling the mind, I encourage people to look towards the
body, look toward sunlight, avoid sunlight and bright light if that
happens to be late at night, so there's a theme that's starting to
emerge which is, in order to control this thing that we call the
nervous system, we have to look back to some of the things we
discussed earlier, like sensation, perception, et cetera, but we have
to ask, what can we control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=4080"&gt;Using The Body To Control The Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm talking about controlling light exposure, controlling your
breathing and body, I'm not going into details right now but you can
see the yoga nidra script or the reveriehealth.com, or Headspace would
be a great place to adopt a meditation practice, any of those are
really teaching you to use your body to control your mind, and to
allow you to explore the mind-body relationship in a way that gives
you more control over your mind and the mind-body relationship, okay?
So we talked about light, we talked about activity and timing of
light, we talked about the usefulness of naps, and these things that
I'm calling non-sleep deep rest, which include meditation, yoga nidra,
and hypnosis, non-sleep deep rest, or what I, hereafter, we will refer
to as NSDR, not to be confused with EMDR, I don't think I've ever
heard NSDR, so I'm planting a flag for NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, as a
way to reset one's ability to be awake after you emerge from NSDR, so
to get some more wakefulness and ability to attend, some emotional
stability, reset, as well as make it better and easier to fall asleep
when you wanna go to sleep at night. Now, the non-sleep deep rest does
have some research to support it, there's a beautiful study done out
of a university in Denmark, I will later provide a link to that study,
that showed that this meditation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=4200"&gt;Drugs &amp;amp; Supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and yoga nidra-type meditation allows dopamine and other
neuromodulators in an area of the brain called the striatum that's
involved in motor planning and motor execution, to reset itself, in
other words, this NSDR can reset our ability to engage in the world in
a way that's very deliberate, and not to throw in another acronym, but
NSDR resets your ability to engage in DPOs, duration, path, and
outcome, so now you're probably rolling your eyes like, "Oh my
goodness, the number of acronyms," but just bear with me because NSDR
is so powerful, because first of all, it doesn't require that you rig
yourself to any device, it doesn't require that you take much time out
of your day, it doesn't require that you ingest anything, except air,
and it can have so many positive effects right down to the
neuromodulator level, so I think in the years to come, my lab's
exploring this in a collaboration with David Spiegel's lab, but other
labs are looking at this as well, I think NSDR is going to start to
play a more prominent role in what we call wellness and health, both
mental health and physical health, so I encourage you to explore those
practices. Okay, so what about things that we can and maybe should or
should not take in order to control and access better sleep and better
wakefulness? We've talked about things you can do or not do, we've
talked about nutrition and the timing of nutrition, now let's talk
about compounds, those could be prescription drugs, those could be
supplements, there are a number of different things that will affect
your circadian timing and behavior, in fact, almost everything that
you could take will affect your circadian timing and behavior, that's
right. So years ago when I was in graduate school, I had a professor,
unfortunately, he passed away now, but his name was Ted Jones, the
late Edward Jones, who was a world-class neuroanatomist, he wrote the
book on the thalamus, in fact, it's called "The Thalamus," and an
expert on patterns of activation in the brain during sleep, and I'll
never forget that during one of these lectures, someone asked Ted the
question, "What is the effect of some drug "on these waves of activity
in the thalamus?" or something, and his answer was incredible. Now, he
was a pretty gruff guy, and so his answer was delivered in the form of
a kind of aggressive direct statement, he said, "A drug is a substance
"that when injected into a person, "produces a scientific
publication," and what he was saying is actually quite true, which is
that most every compound will have some effect on some aspect of
biology, this is why it's hard to sort through everything that's on
PubMed, if you put any molecule or compound or drug into PubMed and
then you put sleep next to it, or alertness next to it, you're likely
to find a paper where there's an effect, but that's not necessarily
telling you that that drug is helpful for that, what it's telling you
is that anytime you change what you take or you stop taking something,
say you're taking sleeping pills, Ambien or whatever it is, and you
stop taking them, your sleep behavior will change. Let's stay you take
an aspirin and you don't normally take aspirin, you will shift your
circadian rhythm, now you might not shift it perceptibly, you might
not create problems for yourself, but anytime you ingest a compound at
high potency, you're going to provide some shift to your circadian
rhythm. Now, that said, there are a couple things that are directly in
line with the biology related to falling and staying asleep and
directly in line with the biology of wakefulness, there's a whole
category of things, like stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine, and
prescription stimulants, that are, the prescription ones were designed
for the treatment of narcolepsy, so things like modafinil or
armodafinil that are designed to created wakefulness, they are all
essentially chemical variants of things that increase epinephrine and
dopamine. Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint that things like
cocaine and amphetamine are just across the board bad, they have so
many addictive and terrible effects, in the proper setting prescribed
by the proper professional, things like modafinil for narcolepsy might
be appropriate, I know that a lot of people out there take Adderall,
even though they haven't been prescribed Adderall, in order to
increase wakefulness, that is essentially, well, it's illegal for one,
but also it's abusing the system in the sense that you're pushing back
on the adenosine system slightly differently than you do caffeine, it
will make you feel more alert, there tends to be a heavy rebound and
they do have an addictive potential, there are also some other effects
of those that could be quite bad, so we're gonna explore stimulants in
a whole month related to drugs, but there are some supplements and
some things that are safer, certainly safer, and that, in cases where
you're doing all the right behaviors, you're exercising and eating
correctly and you're still having trouble with sleep, that can be
beneficial for falling and staying asleep. Now, I wanna be very clear,
I am not pushing supplements, I am just pointing you toward some
things that have been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have some
benefit. The first one is magnesium, there are many forms of
magnesium, but certain forms of magnesium can have positive effects on
sleepiness and the ability to stay asleep, mainly by way of increasing
neurotransmitters like GABA which help turn off the DPO, the kind of
thinking about the future, duration-path-outcome analysis, and make
one's mind kind of drift in space and time and make it easier to fall
asleep, there are a lot of forms of magnesium out there, but in
particular is magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, which you have
to check to see if this is right for you, check with your doctor, but
magnesium threonate is associated with transporters in the body that
bring more of it into cells that allow people to feel this kind of
drowsiness and help them fall asleep, so I personally, I can only talk
about what I personally do, I personally take 3 or 400 milligrams of
magnesium threonate about 30 to 60 minutes before sleep, and it helps
me fall asleep. The other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me, also helps me
turn off my mind and fall asleep, I take it 30 to 60 minutes
throughout the day. Interestingly, theanine is now being introduced to
a lot of energy drinks in order to take away the jitters that are
associated with drinking too much caffeine or with some other things
that are in the energy drinks, energy drinks can be problematic, they
can contain a lot of L-taurine, I'll just tell you an anecdote, when I
was a postdoc, I was drinking a lot of a particular energy drink, it
has a lot of taurine in it, and actually the whites of my eyes, the
sclera, as it's called, of my eyes turned beet red, and I went to a
friend who's an ophthalmologist, I said, "Look, I'm not a marijuana
smoker, "I haven't been hit on the head, "I don't know what's going
on," and he looked and he said, "I think you've got some microvascular
damage," and we walked through what I was taking and doing, and he
said, "Oh, it's probably the taurine, "excessive levels of taurine
"can create some microvascular damage." So if you're having
microvascular damage in your eye, you probably have microvascular
damage deeper in your skull, so I stopped, that's the reason why I
don't take energy drinks, so just a consideration, again, I'm not here
to tell you what to do or not do, but just wanna arm you with
information. The thing about theanine and magnesium is taken together,
they do, for some people, they can make them so sleepy and sleep so
deeply that they actually have trouble waking up in the morning, so
you have to play with these things and titrate them if you decide to
use them, again, if you decide to go this route, I would not start by
taking supplements, I would start by getting your light-viewing
behavior correct, and then think about your nutrition and then think
about your activity and then think about whether or not you wanna
supplement, we already talked about melatonin earlier. There's another
supplement that could be quite useful, which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-
I-N,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=4680"&gt;Sleep Walking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is a derivative of chamomile, 50 milligrams of apigenin also can
augment or support this kind of creation of a sleepiness to help fall
asleep and stay asleep. A note about sleepwalkers and people with very
vivid dreams, theanine can often make your dreams very vivid,
sleepwalkers should be careful about taking theanine, everyone should
be careful about taking anything, and don't take anything without
consulting your board-certified M.D. or healthcare professional first,
okay? Your health is your responsibility, I am not gonna take
responsibility for what you decide to do experimentally in any case,
but especially as it relates to supplementation and drugs. As a
important point, apigenin is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor, so
women who want to keep their estrogen levels high, or at whatever
levels they happen to be at, should probably avoid apigenin
altogether, and men, take that into consideration as well, men need
estrogen also, you don't wanna completely eliminate your estrogen,
that it can create all sorts of bad effects on libido and cognition,
et cetera, so apigenin in some people is gonna be a pretty strong
estrogen inhibitor, so keep that in mind. There are other things you
can take to help you sleep better, those are the legal ones that, at
least I'm aware of, have pretty broad safety margins, but again, you
need to explore your safety margins with any compound. I think a great
website that I can refer you to is examine.com, examine, the word,
just as it sounds, .com, is a website, I have no relation to them, but
there, you can find links to peer-reviewed studies for any compound or
supplement, as well as some important warnings related to the things I
discussed, as well as any other thing that you might decide to
supplement with or ingest to help improve your sleep. Okay, that was a
lot of information about how to get better at sleeping, falling
asleep, wakefulness, et cetera. An important feature of this podcast,
as you know,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&amp;amp;t=4800"&gt;Office Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is that we dive deep into topics for several episodes at a time, at
least a month at a time, so by stopping here, I recognize that there
are probably many more questions that you still have, and the great
thing about that is that we have another episode coming up soon, I'm
going to hold office hours where I'm going to answer your specific
questions about episodes one and two, so if you have questions about
this episode, you have questions about episode one, write them down,
put them in the comments, I'll also do a post on Instagram where you

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. (upbeat guitar music) I'm
Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine. For today's podcast we're going to
talk about the parts list of the nervous system. Now that might sound
boring, but these are the bits and pieces that together make up
everything about your experience of life, from what you think about to
what you feel, what you imagine, and what you accomplish from the day
you're born until the day you die. That parts list is really
incredible because it has a history associated with it that really
provides a window into all sorts of things like engineering, warfare,
religion, and philosophy. So I'm going to share with you the parts
list that makes up who you are through the lens of some of those other
aspects of life and other aspects of the history of the discovery of
the nervous system. By the end of this podcast I promise you're going
to understand a lot more about how you work and how to apply that
knowledge. There's going to be a little bit of story. There's going to
be a lot of discussion about the people who made these particular
discoveries. There'll be a little bit of technical language. There's
no way to avoid that. But at the end you're going to have in hand what
will be the equivalent of an entire semester of learning about the
nervous system and how you work So a few important points before we
get started. I am not a medical doctor. That means I don't prescribe
anything. I'm a professor, so sometimes I'll profess things. In fact,
I profess a lot of things. We are going to talk about some basic
functioning of the nervous system parts and et cetera, but we're also
going to talk about how to apply that knowledge. That said, your
healthcare, your wellbeing is your responsibility. So anytime we talk
about tools please filter it through that responsibility. Talk to a
healthcare professional if you're going to explore any new tools or
practices and be smart in your pursuit of these new tools. Also wanna
emphasize that this podcast and the other things I do on social media
are my personal goal of bringing zero cost to consumer information to
the general public. It is separate from my role at Stanford
University. In that spirit I really want to thank the sponsors of
today's podcast. The first one is Athletic Greens which is an all-in-
one drink. It's a greens drink that has vitamins, minerals,
probiotics, prebiotics. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012 so
I'm really delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I
like it is because I like vitamins and minerals, I think they're
important to my health and it can be kind of overwhelming to know what
to take in that landscape. So by taking one thing that also happens to
taste really good I get all the vitamins minerals, et cetera, that I
need. There's also a lot of data there now about the importance of the
gut microbiome for immune health and for the gut brain access, all
these things. And the probiotics and prebiotics are important to me
for that reason. If you want to try Athletic Greens you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman, and put in the code word Huberman at
checkout. If you do that they'll send you a year's supply of vitamin
D3 and K2. There's a lot in the news lately about the importance of
vitamin D3. We can all get vitamin D3 from sunlight but many of us
aren't getting enough sunlight. Vitamin D3 has been shown to be
relevant to the immune system and the hormone systems, et cetera. So
once again that's athleticgreens.com/huberman, enter Huberman at
checkout, and you get the year supply of D3 and K2 along with your
Athletic Greens. This podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker
which is a health monitoring company. It uses blood tests and saliva
tests to look at things like DNA and metabolic markers and monitors
your hormones, a huge number of different parameters of health that
really can only be measured accurately through blood and saliva tests.
I use Inside Tracker because I'm a big believer in data. There's a lot
of aspects to our biology that can only be accurately measured by way
of blood tests and saliva tests. The thing that's really nice about
Inside Tracker is that rather than just giving you a bunch of numbers
back of the levels of these things in your body, it gives you, through
a really simple platform, information about what to do with all those
levels of hormones and metabolic markers, et cetera. It also has a
feature which is particularly interesting which it measures your inner
age, which is more a measure of your biological age as opposed to your
chronological age. And all that information is organized so that you
can make changes in your nutritional regimes or your exercise regimes
and watch how those markers change over time. So if you want to try
Inside Tracker you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman and they'll
give you 25% off at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=300"&gt;What is the Nervous System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about the nervous system. The reason I say your nervous
system and not your brain is because your brain is actually just one
piece of this larger, more important thing, frankly, that we call the
nervous system. The nervous system includes your brain and your spinal
cord but also all the connections between your brain and your spinal
cord and the organs of your body. It also includes, very importantly,
all the connections between your organs back to your spinal cord and
brain. So the way to think about how you function at every level from
the moment you're born until the day you die, everything you think and
remember and feel and imagine is that your nervous system is this
continuous loop of communication between the brain, spinal cord, and
body and body, spinal cord, and brain. In fact, we really can't even
separate them. It's one continuous loop. You may have heard of
something called a Mobius strip. A Mobius strip is almost like one of
these impossible figures that no matter which angle you look at it
from you can't tell where it starts and where it ends. And that's
really how your nervous system is built. That's the structure that
allows you to, for instance, deploy immune cells, to release cells
that will go kill infection when you're in the presence of infection.
Most people just think about that as a function of the immune system
but actually it's your nervous system that tells organs like your
spleen to release killer cells that go and hunt down those bacterial
and viral invaders and gobble them up. If you have a stomach ache, for
instance, sure, you feel that in your stomach, but it's really your
nervous system that's causing the stomach ache. The ache aspect of it
is a nervous system feature. So when we want to talk about experience
or we want to talk about how to change the self in any way, we really
need to think about the nervous system first. It is fair to say that
the nervous system governs all other biological systems of the body,
and it's also influenced by those other biological systems. So if
we're talking about the nervous system we need to get a little
specific about what we mean. It's not just this big loop of wires. In
fact, there's a interesting story about that because at the turn of
the sort of 1800s to 1900s, it actually was believed that our nervous
system was just one giant cell. But two guys, that names aren't super
important, but in fairness to their important discovery, Ramon y
Cajal, a Spaniard, Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy, figured out how to
label or stain the nervous system in a way that revealed, oh my
goodness, we're actually made up of trillions of these little cells,
nerve cells that are called neurons. And that's what a neuron is. It's
just a nerve cell. They also saw that those nerve cells weren't
touching one another. They're actually separated by little gaps. And
those little gaps you may have heard of before, they're called
synapses. Those synapses are where the chemicals from one neuron are
kind of spit out or vomited into. And then the next nerve cell detects
those chemicals and then passes electricity down its length to the
next nerve cell and so forth. So really the way to think about your
body and your thoughts and your mind is that you are a flow of
electricity, right? There's nothing mystical about this. You're a flow
of electricity between these different nerve cells. And depending on
which nerve cells are active you might be lifting your arm or lowering
your arm. You might be seeing something and perceiving that it's red
or you might be seeing something and perceiving that it's green, all
depending on which nerve cells are electrically active at a given
moment. The example of perceiving red or perceiving green is a
particularly good example because so often our experience of the world
makes it seem as if these out these things that are happening outside
us are actually happening inside us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=535"&gt;Deja Vu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the language of the nervous system is just electricity. It's just
like a Morse code of some sort or the syllables and words and
consonants and vowels of language. It just depends on how they're
assembled, what order. And so that brings us to the issue of how the
nervous system works. The way to think about how the nervous system
works is that our experiences, our memories, everything is sort of
like the keys on a piano being played in a particular order, right? If
I play the keys on a piano in a particular order and with a particular
intensity, that's a given song. We can make that analogous to a given
experience. It's not really that the key, you know, A sharp or E flat
is the song. It's just one component of the song. So when you hear
that, you know, for instance, there's a brain area called the
hippocampus, which there is, that's involved in memory. Well, it's
involved in memory, but it's not that memories are stored there as,
you know, sentences. They're stored there as patterns of electricity
in neurons that when repeated, give you the sense that you are
experiencing the thing again. In fact, deja vu, the sense that what
you're experiencing is so familiar and like something that you've
experienced previously is merely that the neurons that were active in
one circumstance are now becoming active in the same circumstance
again. And so it's really just like hearing the same song maybe not
played on a piano but next time on a classical guitar, there's
something similar about that song even though it's being played on two
different instruments. So I think it's important that people
understand the parts of their nervous system, and that it includes so
much more than just the brain and that there are these things, neurons
and synapses. But really that it's the electrical activity of these
neurons that dictates our experience. So if the early 1900s were when
these neurons were discovered, certainly a lot has happened since
then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=650"&gt;How War, Guns &amp;amp; Soap Shaped Our Understanding of the Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in that time between the early 1900s and now there's some
important events that actually happened in history that gave us
insight into how the nervous system works. One of the more surprising
ones was actually warfare. So as most everybody knows in warfare
people get shot and people often die but many people get shot and they
don't die. And in World War One, there were some changes in artillery,
in bullets that made for a situation where bullets would enter the
body and brain at very discrete locations and would go out the other
side of the body or brain and also make a very small hole at that exit
location. And in doing so produced a lot of naturally occurring
lesions of the nervous system. Now you say, okay, well, how does that
relate to neuroscience? Well, unlike previous years where a lot of the
artillery would create these big sort of holes as the bullets would
blow out of the brain or body, I know this is rather gruesome, when
the holes were very discrete they entered at one point and left at
another point, they would take out or destroy very discrete bits of
neural tissue, of the nervous system. So people were coming back from
war with holes in their brain and in other parts of their nervous
system that were limited to very specific locations. In addition to
that, there was some advancement in the cleaning of wounds that
happened so many more people were surviving. What this meant was that
neurologists now had a collection of patients that would come back and
they'd have holes in very specific locations of their brain. And
they'd say things like, well, I can recognize faces but I can't
recognize who those faces belong to. I know it's a face, but I don't
know who it belongs to. And after that person eventually died the
neurologist would figure out, ah, I've had 10 patients that all told
me that they couldn't recognize faces. And they all had these bullet
holes that went through a particular region of the brain. And that's
how we know a lot about how particular brain regions like the
hippocampus work. In fact, some of the more amazing examples of this,
where people would come back and they, for instance, would speak in
complete gibberish whereas previously they could speak normally. And
even though they were speaking in complete gibberish they could
understand language perfectly. That's how we know that speech and
language are actually controlled by separate portions of the nervous
system. And there are many examples like that. People that couldn't
recognize the faces of famous people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=810"&gt;Jennifer Aniston Neurons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, and that actually brings us to an interesting example in modern
times. Many, many years later in the early 2000s there was actually a
paper that was published in the journal "Nature", excellent journal,
showing that in a human being, a perfectly healthy human being, there
was a neuron that would become electrically active only when the
person viewed the picture of Jennifer Aniston, the actress. So
literally a neuron that represented Jennifer Aniston, so-called
Jennifer Aniston cells, neuroscientists know about the Jennifer
Aniston cells. If you can recognize Jennifer Aniston's face you have
Jennifer Aniston neurons, and presumably also have neurons that can
recognize the faces of other famous and non-famous people. So that
indicates that our brain is really a map of our experience. We come
into the world and our brain has a kind of bias towards learning
particular kinds of things. It's ready to receive information and
learn that information, but the brain is really a map of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=870"&gt;Sensations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about what experience really is. What does it mean for
your brain to work? Well I think it's fair to say that the nervous
system really does five things, maybe six. The first one is sensation.
So this is important to understand for any and all of you that want to
change your nervous system or to apply tools to make your nervous
system work better. Sensation is a non-negotiable element of your
nervous system. You have neurons in your eye that perceive certain
colors of light and certain directions of movement. You have neurons
in your skin that perceive particular kinds of touch, like light touch
or firm touch or painful touch. You have neurons in your ears that
perceive certain sounds. Your entire experience of life is filtered by
these, what we call sensory receptors if you want to know what the
name is. So this always raises an interesting question. People ask,
well, is there much more out there? Is there a lot more happening in
the world that I'm not experiencing or that humans aren't
experiencing? And the answer of course is yes, there are many species
on this planet that are perceiving things that we will never perceive
unless we apply technology. The best example I could think of off the
top of my head would be something like infrared vision. There are
snakes out there, pit vipers and so forth, that can sense heat
emissions from other animals. They don't actually see their shape.
They sense their heat shape and their heat emissions. Humans can't do
that unless of course they put on infrared goggles or something that
would allow them to detect those heat emissions. There are turtles and
certain species of birds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=970"&gt;Magnetic Sensing &amp;amp; Mating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that migrate long distances that can detect magnetic fields because
they have neurons, again, it's the nervous system that allows them to
do this. So they have neurons in their nose and in their head that
allow them to migrate along magnetic fields in order to, as amazing as
this sounds, go from one particular location in the ocean, thousands
of miles away to all aggregate on one particular beach at a particular
time of year so that they can mate, lay eggs, and then wander back off
into the sea to die. And then their young will eventually hatch, those
cute little turtles will shuffle to the ocean, swim off and go do the
exact same thing. They don't migrate that distance by vision. They
don't do it by smell. They do it by sensing magnetic fields. And many
other species do these incredible things. We don't, humans are not
magnetic sensing organisms. We can't do that because we don't have
receptors that sense magnetic fields. There's some data that maybe
some humans can sense magnetic fields but you should be very skeptical
of anyone that's convinced that they can do that with any degree of
robustness or accuracy, because even the people that can do this
aren't necessarily aware that they can. Maybe a topic for a future
podcast. So we have sensation, then we have perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=1050"&gt;Perceptions &amp;amp; The Spotlight of Attention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perception is our ability to take what we're sensing and focus on it
and make sense of it, to explore it, to remember it. So really
perceptions are just whichever sensations we happen to be paying
attention to at any moment. And you can do this right now. You can
experience perception and the difference between perception and
sensation very easily. If, for instance, I tell you to pay attention
to the contact of your feet, the bottoms of your feet, with whatever
surface they happen to be in contact with, maybe it's shoes, maybe
it's the floor, if your feet are up maybe it's air. The moment you
place your, what we call the spotlight of attention or the spotlight
of perception on your feet. You are now perceiving what was happening
there, what was being sensed there. The sensation was happening all
along however. So while sensation is not negotiable you can't change
your receptors unless you adopt some new technology, perception is
under the control of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=1110"&gt;Multi-Tasking Is Real&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the way to think about attention is it's like a spotlight, except
it's not one spotlight. You actually have two attentional spotlights.
Anyone that tells you you can't multitask, tell them they're wrong.
And if they disagree with you tell them to contact me because in old
world primates of which humans are, we are able to do what's called
covert attention. We can place a spotlight of attention on something,
for instance, something we're reading or looking at or someone that
we're listening to. And we can place a second spotlight of attention
on something we're eating and how it tastes or our child running
around in the room or my dog. You can split your attention into two
locations but of course you can also bring your attention, that is,
your perception, to one particular location. You can dilate your
attention kind of like making a spotlight more diffuse or you can make
it more concentrated. This is very important to understand if you're
going to think about tools to improve your nervous system, whether or
not that tool is in the form of a chemical that you decide to take,
maybe a supplement to increase some chemical in your brain if that's
your choice, or a brain machine device or you're going to try and
learn something better by engaging in some focus or motivated pursuit
for some period of time each day. Attention is something that is
absolutely under your control, in particular when you're rested. And
we'll get back to this. But when you are rested, and we'll define rest
very clearly, you are able to direct your attention in very deliberate
ways. And that's because we have something in our nervous system which
is sort of like a two way street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=1210"&gt;Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Control of Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that two way street is a communication between the aspects of our
nervous system that are reflexive and the aspects of our nervous
system that are deliberate. So we all know what it's like to be
reflexive. You go through life, you're walking. If you already know
how to walk you don't think about your walking. You just walk. And
that's because the nervous system wants to pass off as much as it can
to reflexive action. That's called bottom up processing. It really
just means that information is flowing in through your senses,
regardless of what you're perceiving, that information is flowing up
and it's directing your activity. But at any moment, for instance,
let's say a car screeches in front of you around the corner, and you
suddenly pause. You are now moving into deliberate action. You would
start looking around in a very deliberate way. The nervous system can
be reflexive in its action or it can be deliberate. If reflexive
action tends to be what we call bottom up, deliberate action and
deliberate perceptions and deliberate thoughts are top down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=1275"&gt;Focusing the Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They require some effort and some focus. But that's the point, you can
decide to focus your attention and energy on anything you want. You
can decide to focus your behavior in any way you want. But it will
always feel like it requires some effort and some strain. Whereas when
you're in reflexive mode, just walking and talking and eating and
doing your thing it's going to feel very easy. And that's because your
nervous system basically wired up to be able to do most things easily
without much metabolic demand, without consuming much energy. But the
moment you try and do something very specific, you're going to feel a
sort of mental friction. It's going to be challenging. So we've got
sensations, perceptions,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=1315"&gt;Emotions + The Chemicals of Emotions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then we've got things that we call feelings slash emotions. And
these get a little complicated because almost all of us, I would hope
all of us, are familiar with things like happiness and sadness or
boredom or frustration. Scientists argue like crazy, neuroscientists
and psychologists and philosophers for that matter, argue like crazy
about what these are and how they work. Certainly emotions and
feelings are the product of the nervous system. They involve the
activity of neurons. But as I mentioned earlier, neurons are
electrically active but they also release chemicals. And there's a
certain category of chemicals that has a very profound influence on
our emotional states. They're called neuromodulators. And those
neuromodulators have names that probably you've heard of before.
Things like dopamine and serotonin and acetylcholine, epinephrine.
Neuromodulators are really interesting because they bias which neurons
are likely to be active and which ones are likely to be inactive. A
simple way to think about neuromodulators is they are sort of like
playlists that you would have on any kind of device where you're going
to play particular categories of music. So for instance, dopamine,
which is often discussed as the molecule of reward or joy, it is
involved in reward. And it does tend to create a sort of upbeat mood
when released in appropriate amounts in the brain. But the reason it
does that is because it makes certain neurons and neural circuits as
we call them more active and others less active. Okay. So serotonin,
for instance, is a molecule that when released tends to make us feel
really good with what we have, our sort of internal landscape and the
resources that we have, whereas dopamine more than being a molecule of
reward is really more a molecule of motivation toward things that are
outside us and that we want to pursue. And we can look at healthy
conditions or situations like being in pursuit of a goal where every
time we accomplish something en route to that goal, a little bit of
dopamine is released and we feel more motivation, that happens. We can
also look at the extreme example of something like mania, where
somebody is so relentlessly in pursuit of external things like money
and relationships that they're sort of in this delusional state of
thinking that they have the resources that they need in order to
pursue all these things when in fact they don't. So these
neuromodulators can exist in normal levels, low levels, high levels.
And that actually gives us a window&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=1470"&gt;Antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into a very important aspect of neuroscience history that all of us
are impacted by today, which is the discovery of antidepressants and
so-called anti-psychotics. In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, it was
discovered that there are compounds, chemicals that can increase or
decrease serotonin, that can increase or decrease dopamine. And that
led to the development of most of what we call antidepressants. Now,
the trick here or the problem is that most of these drugs, especially
in the 1950s and '60s, they would reduce serotonin but they would also
reduce dopamine or they would increase serotonin, but they would also
increase some other neuromodulator chemical. And that's because all
these chemical systems in the body, but the neuromodulators in
particular, have a lot of receptors. Now, these are different than the
receptors we were talking about earlier. The receptors I'm talking
about now are sort of like parking spots where dopamine is released.
And if it attaches to a receptor, say on the heart, it might make the
heart beat faster because there's a certain kind of receptor on the
heart. Whereas if dopamine is released and goes and attaches to muscle
it might have a completely different effect on the muscle. And in
fact, it does. So different receptors on different organs of the body
are the ways that these neuromodulators can have all these different
effects on different aspects of our biology. This is most salient in
the example of some of the antidepressants that have sexual side
effects or that blunt appetite or that blunt motivation. You know,
many of these which increase serotonin can be very beneficial for
people. It can elevate their mood. It can make them feel better. But
they also if their, the doses are too high or if that particular drug
isn't right for somebody that person experiences challenges with
motivation or appetite or libido because serotonin is binding to
receptors in the areas of the brain that control those other things as
well. So we talked about sensation. We talked about perception. When
we talk about feelings, we have to consider these neuromodulators. And
we have to consider also that feelings and emotions are contextual. In
some cultures showing a lot of joy or a lot of sadness is entirely
appropriate, in other cultures it's considered inappropriate. So I
don't think it's fair to say that there is a sadness circuit or area
of the brain or a happiness circuit or area of the brain. However, it
is fair to say that certain chemicals and certain brain circuits tend
to be active when we are in motivated states, tend to be active when
we are in non-motivated lazy states, tend to be active when we are
focused and tend to be active when we are not focused. I want to
emphasize also that emotions are something that we generally feel are
not under our control. We feel like they kind of geyser up within us
and they just kind of happen to us. And that's because they are
somewhat reflexive. We don't really set out with a deliberate thought
to be happy or a deliberate thought to be sad. We tend to experience
them in kind of a passive reflexive way. And that brings us to the
next thing, which are thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=1660"&gt;Thoughts &amp;amp; Thought Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts are really interesting because in many ways they're like
perceptions except that they draw on not just what's happening in the
present but also things we remember from the past and things that we
anticipate about the future. The other thing about thoughts that's
really interesting is that thoughts can be both reflexive, they can
just be occurring all the time sort of like pop-up windows on a poorly
filtered web browser, or they can be deliberate. We can decide to have
a thought. In fact, right now you could decide to have a thought just
like you would decide to write something out on a piece of paper. You
could decide that you're listening to a podcast, that you are in a
particular location. You're not just paying attention to what's
happening, you're directing your thought process. And a lot of people
don't understand or at least appreciate that the thought patterns and
the neural circuits that underlie thoughts can actually be controlled
in this deliberate way. And then finally there are actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=1715"&gt;Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions or behaviors are perhaps the most important aspect of our
nervous system. Because first of all, our behaviors are actually the
only thing that are going to create any fossil record of our
existence. You know, after we die, the nervous system deteriorates,
our skeleton will remain. But it's, you know, in the moment of
experiencing something very joyful or something very sad, it can feel
so all encompassing that we actually think that it has some meaning
beyond that moment. But actually for humans and I think for all
species, the sensations, the perceptions and the thoughts and the
feelings that we have in our lifespan, none of that is actually
carried forward except the ones that we take and we convert into
actions such as writing, actions such as words, actions such as
engineering new things. And so the fossil record of our species and
each one of us is really through action. And that, in part, is why so
much of our nervous system is devoted to converting sensation,
perceptions, feelings, and thoughts into actions. In fact, the great
neuroscientist or physiologist Sherrington won a Nobel prize for his
work in mapping some of the circuitry, the connections between nerve
cells that give rise to movement. And he said, "Movement is the final
common pathway". The other way to think about it is that one of the
reasons that our central nervous system, our brain and spinal cord
include this stuff in our skull but also connects so heavily to the
body is because most everything that we experience, including our
thoughts and feelings, was really designed to either impact our
behavior or not. And the fact that thoughts allow us to reach into the
past and anticipate the future and not just experience what's
happening in the moment gave rise to an incredible capacity for us to
engage in behaviors that are not just for the moment, they're based on
things that we know from the past and that we would like to see in the
future. And this aspect of our nervous system, of creating movement,
occurs through some very simple pathways. The reflexive pathway
basically includes areas of the brain stem we call central pattern
generators. When you walk, provided you already know how to walk, you
are basically walking because you have these central pattern
generators, groups of neurons that generate right foot, left foot,
right foot, left foot kind of movement. However, when you decide to
move in a particular deliberate way that requires a little more
attention you start to engage areas of your brain for top-down
processing where your forebrain works from the top down to control
those central pattern generators so that maybe it's right foot, right
foot, left foot, right foot, right foot, left foot if maybe you're
hiking along some rocks or something. And you have to engage in that
kind of movement. So movement, just like thoughts, can be either
reflexive or deliberate. And when we talk about deliberate I want to
be very specific about how your brain works in a deliberate way
because it gives rise to a very important feature of the nervous
system that we're going to talk about next, which is your ability to
change your nervous system. And what I'd like to center on for a
second is this notion of what does it mean for the nervous system to
do something deliberately? Well, when you do something deliberately,
you pay attention, you are bringing your perception to an analysis of
three things, duration, how long something is is going to take or
should be done, path, what you should be doing, and outcome, if you do
something for a given length of time, what's going to happen. Now when
you're walking down the street or you're eating or you're just talking
reflexively, you're not doing this what I call DPO, duration, path,
outcome, type of deliberate function in your brain and nervous system.
But the moment you decide to learn something or to resist speaking or
to speak up when you would rather be quiet, anytime you're
deliberately kind of forcing yourself over a threshold, you're
engaging these brain circuits and these nervous system circuits that
suddenly make it feel as if something is challenging. Something has
changed. Well, what's changed? What's changed is that when you engage
in this duration, path, and outcome type of thinking or behavior or
way of being you start to recruit these neuromodulators that are
released from particular areas of your brain, and also it turns out
from your body. and they start cuing to your nervous system.
Something's different. Something's different now about what I'm doing.
Something's different about what I'm feeling. Let's give an example
where perhaps somebody says something that's triggering to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=2000"&gt;How We Control Our Impulses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't like it. And you know you shouldn't respond. You feel like,
oh, I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond.
You're actively suppressing your behavior through top down processing.
Your forebrain is actually preventing you from saying the thing that
you know you shouldn't say or that maybe you should wait to say or say
in a different form. This feels like agitation and stress because
you're actually suppressing a circuit. We actually can see examples of
what happens when you're not doing this well. Some of the examples
come from children. If you look at young children they don't have the
forebrain circuitry to engage in this top down processing until they
reach age 22, even 25. But in young children, you see this in a really
robust way. You'll see they'll be rocking back and forth. It's hard
for them to sit still because those central pattern generators are
constantly going in the background. Whereas adults can sit still. A
kid sees a piece of candy that it wants and will just reach out and
grab it. Whereas an adult probably would ask if they could have a
piece or wait until they were offered a piece in most cases. People
that have damage to the certain areas of the frontal lobes don't have
this kind of restriction. They'll just blurt things out. They'll just
say things. We all know people like this. Impulsivity is a lack of top
down control, a lack of top-down processing. The other thing that will
turn off the forebrain and make it harder to top-down processing is a
couple of drinks containing alcohol. The removal of inhibition is
actually removal of neural inhibition, of nerve cells suppressing the
activity of other nerve cells. And so when you look at people that
have damage to their frontal lobes or you look at puppies or you look
at young children, everything's a stimulus. Everything is a potential
interaction for them. And they have a very hard time restricting their
behavior and their speech. So a lot of the motor system is designed to
just work in a reflexive way. And then when we decide we want to learn
something or do something or not do something, we have to engage in
this top-down restriction. And it feels like agitation because it's
accompanied by the release of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine,
which in the body we call adrenaline. And it actually makes us feel
agitated. So for those of you that are trying to learn something new
or to learn to suppress your responses or be more deliberate and
careful in your responses, that is going to feel challenging for a
particular reason. It's going to feel challenging because the
chemicals in your body that are released in association with that
effort are designed to make you feel kind of agitated. That low-level
tremor that sometimes people feel when they're really, really angry is
actually a chemically induced low-level tremor. And it's the, what I
call limbic friction. There's an area of your brain that's involved in
our more primitive reflexive responses called the limbic system. And
the frontal cortex is in a friction, it's in a tug of war with that
system all the time. Unless of course you have damage to the frontal
lobe or you've had too much to drink or something. In which case you
tend to just say and do whatever. And so this is really important to
understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=2185"&gt;Neuroplasticity: The Holy Grail of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because if you want to understand neuroplasticity, you want to
understand how to shape your behavior, how to shape your thinking, how
to change how you're able to perform in any context, the most
important thing to understand is that it requires top-down processing.
It requires this feeling of agitation. In fact, I would say the
agitation and strain is the entry point to neuroplasticity. So let's
take a look at what neuroplasticity is. Let's explore it, not as the
way it's normally talked about in modern culture, neuroplasticity,
plasticity is great. Well, what exactly do people mean? Plasticity
itself is just a process by which neurons can change their connections
and the way they work so that you can go from things being very
challenging and deliberate, requiring a lot of effort and strain, to
them being reflexive. And typically when we hear about plasticity,
we're thinking about positive or what I call adaptive plasticity. A
lot of plasticity can be induced, for instance by brain damage, but
that's generally not the kind of plasticity that we want. So when I
say plasticity, unless I say otherwise I mean adaptive plasticity. And
in particular most of the neuroplasticity that people want is self-
directed plasticity. Because if there's one truism to neuroplasticity,
it's that from birth until about age 25 the brain is incredibly
plastic. Kids are learning all sorts of things but they can learn it
passively. They don't have to work too hard or focus too hard,
although focus helps, to learn new things, acquire new languages,
acquire new skills. But if you're an adult and you want to change your
neural circuitry at the level of emotions or behavior or thoughts or
anything really, you absolutely need to ask two important questions.
One, what particular aspect of my nervous system am I trying to
change? Meaning, am I trying to change my emotions or my perceptions,
my sensations? And which ones are available for me to change? And then
the second question is how are you going to go about that? What is the
structure of a regimen to engage neuroplasticity? And it turns out
that the answer to that second question is governed by how awake or
how sleepy we are. So let's talk about that next. Neuroplasticity is
the ability for these connections in the brain and body to change in
response to experience. And what's so incredible about the human
nervous system in particular is that we can direct our own neural
changes. We can decide that we want to change our brain. In other
words, our brain can change itself and our nervous system can change
itself. And the same can't be said for other organs of the body. Even
though our other organs of the body have some ability to change, they
can't direct it. They can't think and decide, you know your gut
doesn't say, oh, you know, I want to be able to digest spicy foods
better so I'm going to rearrange the connections to be able to do
that. Whereas your brain can decide that you want to learn a language
or you want to be less emotionally reactive or more emotionally
engaged, and you can undergo a series of steps that will allow your
brain to make those changes so that eventually it becomes reflexive
for you to do that, which is absolutely incredible. For a long time it
was thought that neuroplasticity was the unique gift of young animals
and humans, that it could only occur when we're young. And in fact, a
young brain is incredibly plastic. Children can learn three languages
without an accent reflexively, whereas adults, it's very challenging.
It takes a lot more effort and strain, a lot more of that duration,
path, outcome kind of thinking in order to achieve those plastic
changes. We now know, however, that the adult brain can change in
response to experience. Nobel prizes were given for the understanding
that the young brain can change very dramatically. I think one of the
most extreme examples would be for people that are born blind from
birth they use the area of their brain that normally would be used for
visualizing objects and colors and things outside of them for braille
reading. In brain imaging studies it's been shown that, you know,
people who are blind from birth, when they braille read, the area of
the brain that would normally light up, if you will, for vision lights
up for braille reading. So that real estate is reallocated for an
entirely different function. If someone is made blind in adulthood,
it's unlikely that their entire visual brain will be taken over by the
areas of the brain that are responsible for touch. However, there's
some evidence that areas of the brain that are involved in hearing and
touch can kind of migrate into that area. And there's a lot of
interest now in trying to figure out how more plasticity can be
induced in adulthood, more positive plasticity. And in order to
understand that process we really have to understand something that
might at first seem totally divorced from neuroplasticity, but
actually lies at the center of neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=2480"&gt;The Portal to Neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for any of you that are interested in changing your nervous system
so that something that you want can go from being very hard or seem
almost impossible and out of reach to being very reflexive, this is
especially important to pay attention to. Plasticity in the adult
human nervous system is gated, meaning it is controlled by
neuromodulators. These things that we talked about earlier, dopamine,
serotonin, and one in particular called acetylcholine, are what open
up plasticity. They literally unveil plasticity and allow brief
periods of time in which whatever information, whatever thing we're
sensing or perceiving or thinking, whatever emotions we feel can
literally be mapped in the brain such that later it will become much
easier for us to experience and feel that thing. Now, this has a dark
side and a positive side. The dark side is it's actually very easy to
get neuroplasticity as an adult through traumatic or terrible or
challenging experiences. But the important question is to say, why is
that? And the reason that's the case is because when something very
bad happens, there's the release of two sets of neuromodulators in the
brain, epinephrine which tends to make us feel alert and agitated,
which is associated with most bad circumstances. And acetylcholine,
which tends to create a even more intense and focused perceptual
spotlight. Remember earlier we were talking about perception and how
it's kind of like a spotlight. Acetylcholine makes that light
particularly bright and particularly restricted to one region of our
experience. And it does that by making certain neurons in our brain
and body active much more than all the rest. So acetylcholine is sorta
like a highlighter marker upon which neuroplasticity then comes in
later and says, wait, which neurons were active in this particularly
alerting phase of whatever, you know, day or night, whenever this
thing happened. So the way it works is this, you can think of
epinephrine as creating this alertness and this kind of unbelievable
level of increased attention compared to what you were experiencing
before. And you can think of acetylcholine as being the molecule that
highlights whatever happens during that period of heightened
alertness. So just to be clear, it's epinephrine creates the
alertness, that's coming from a subset of neurons in the brain stem if
you're interested, and acetylcholine coming from an area of the
forebrain is tagging or marking the neurons that are particularly
active during this heightened level of alertness. Now that marks the
cells, the neurons and the synapses for strengthening, for becoming
more likely to be active in the future even without us thinking about
it. Okay? So in bad circumstances this all happens without us having
to do much. When we want something to happen, however, we want to
learn a language, we want to learn a new skill, we want to become more
motivated, what do we know for certain? We know that that process of
getting neuroplasticity so that we have more focus, more motivation,
absolutely requires the release of epinephrine. We have to have
alertness in order to have focus and we have to have focus in order to
direct those plastic changes to particular parts of our nervous
system. Now, this has immense implications in thinking about the
various tools, whether or not those are chemical tools or machine
tools or just self-induced regimens of how long or how intensely
you're going to focus in order to get neuroplasticity. But there's
another side to it. The dirty secret of neuroplasticity is that no
neuroplasticity occurs during the thing you're trying to learn, during
the terrible event, during the great event. During the thing that
you're really trying to shape and learn, nothing is actually changing
between the neurons that is going to last. All the neuroplasticity,
the strengthening of the synapses, the addition, in some cases, of new
nerve cells or at least connections between nerve cells, all of that
occurs at a very different phase of life which is when we are in sleep
and non-sleep deep rest. And so neuroplasticity, which is the kind of
Holy Grail of human experience of, you know, this is the New Year and
everyone's thinking New Year's resolutions. And right now, perhaps
everything's organized and people are highly motivated but what
happens in March or April or May? Well, that all depends on how much
attention and focus one can continually bring to whatever it is
they're trying to learn, so much so that agitation and a feeling of
strain are actually required for this process of neuro-plasticity to
get triggered. But the actual rewiring occurs during periods of sleep
and non-sleep deep rest. There's a study published last year that's
particularly relevant here that I want to share, it was not done by my
laboratory, that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=2800"&gt;Accelerating Learning in Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is not deep sleep, but essentially doing something very hard and
very intense and then taking 20 minutes immediately afterwards to
deliberately turn off the deliberate focused thinking and engagement
actually accelerated neuroplasticity. There's another study that's
just incredible. And we're going to go into this in a future episode
of the podcast not too long from now, that showed that if people are
learning a particular skill, it could be a language skill or a motor
skill, and they hear a tone just playing in the background, and the
tone is playing periodically in the background, like just a bell. In
deep sleep, if that bell is played learning is much faster for the
thing that they were learning while they were awake. It somehow cues
the nervous system in sleep, doesn't even have to be in dreaming, that
something that happened in the waking phase was especially important.
So much so that that bell is sort of a Pavlovian cue, it's sort of a
reminder to the sleeping brain, oh, you need to remember what it is
that you were learning at that particular time of day. And the
learning rates and the rates of retention, meaning how much people can
remember from the thing they learned, are significantly higher under
those conditions. So I'm going to talk about how to apply all this
knowledge a little bit more in this podcast episode but also in future
episodes. But it really speaks to the really key importance of sleep
and focus, these two opposite ends of our attentional state. When
we're in sleep these DPOs, duration, path, and outcome analysis are
impossible. We just can't do that. We are only in relation to what's
happening inside of us. So sleep is key. Also key are periods of non-
sleep deep rest where we're turning off our analysis of duration,
path, and outcome, in particular for the thing that we were just
trying to learn. And we're in this kind of liminal state where our
attention is kind of drifting all over. It turns out that's very
important for the consolidation, for the changes between the nerve
cells that will allow what we were trying to learn to go from being
deliberate and hard and stressful and a strain to easy and reflexive.
This also points to how different people, including many modern
clinicians, are thinking about how to prevent bad circumstances,
traumas, from routing their way into our nervous system permanently.
It says that you might want to interfere with certain aspects of brain
states that are away from the bad thing that happened, the brain
states that happened the next day or the next month or the next year.
And also, I want to make sure that I pay attention to the fact that
for many of you you're thinking about neuro-plasticity not just in
changing your nervous system to add something new but to also get rid
of things that you don't like, right? That you want to forget bad
experiences or at least remove the emotional contingency of a bad
relationship or a bad relationship to some thing or some person or
some event. Learning to fear certain things, less to eliminate a
phobia, to erase a trauma. The memories themselves don't get erased.
I'm sorry to say that the memories don't themselves get erased, but
the emotional load of memories can be reduced. And there are a number
of different ways that that can happen but they all require this thing
that we're calling neuroplasticity. We're going to have a large number
of discussions about neuroplasticity in depth, but the most important
thing to understand is that it is indeed a two phase process. What
governs the transition between alert and focused&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=3020"&gt;The Pillar of Plasticity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and these deep rest and deep sleep states is a system in our brain and
body, a certain aspect of the nervous system called the autonomic
nervous system. And it is immensely important to understand how this
autonomic nervous system works. It has names like the sympathetic
nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system which frankly are
complicated names because they're a little bit misleading. Sympathetic
is the one that's associated with more alertness. Parasympathetic is
the one that's associated with more calmness. And it gets really
misleading because the sympathetic nervous system sounds like
sympathy. And then people think it's related to calm. I'm going to
call it the alertness system and the calmness system, because even
though sympathetic and parasympathetic are sometimes used, people
really get confused. So the way to think about the autonomic nervous
system and the reason it's important for every aspect of your life,
but in particular for neuroplasticity and engaging in these focus
states and in these de-focused states is that it works sort of like a
seesaw. Every 24 hours, we're all familiar with the fact that when we
wake up in the morning we might be a little bit groggy but then
generally we're more alert. And then as evening comes around we tend
to become a little more relaxed and sleepy. Eventually at some point
at night, we go to sleep. So we go from alert to deeply calm. And as
we do that, we go from an ability to engage in these very focused
duration, path, outcome types of analyses to states in sleep that are
completely divorced from duration, path, and outcome in which
everything is completely random and untethered in terms of our
sensations, perceptions and feelings and so forth. So every 24 hours,
we have a phase of our day that is optimal for thinking and focusing
and learning and neuroplasticity and doing all sorts of things. We
have energy as well. And at another phase of our day we're tired and
we have no ability to focus. We have no ability to engage in duration,
path, outcome types of analyses. And it's interesting that both phases
are important for shaping our nervous system in the ways that we want.
So if we want to engage neuroplasticity and we want to get the most
out of our nervous system we each have to master both the transition
between wakefulness and sleep and the transition between sleep and
wakefulness. Now so much has been made of the importance of sleep. And
it is critically important for wound healing, for learning as I just
mentioned, for consolidating learning, for all aspects of our immune
system. It is the one period of time in which we're not doing these
duration, path, and outcome types of analyses. And it is critically
important to all aspects of our health, including our longevity. Much
less has been made, however, of how to get better at sleeping, how to
get better at the process that involves falling asleep, staying
asleep, and accessing the states of mind and body that involve total
paralysis. Most people don't know this but you're actually paralyzed
during much of your sleep so that you can't act out your dreams,
presumably. But also where your brain is in a total idle state where
it's not controlling anything, it's just left to kind of free run. And
there are certain things that we can all do in order to master that
transition, in order to get better at sleeping. And it involves much
more than just how much we sleep. We're all being told, of course,
that we need to sleep more but there's also the issue of sleep
quality, accessing those deep States of non DPO thinking. Accessing
the right timing of sleep, not a lot has been discussed publicly, as
far as I'm aware, of when to time your sleep. I think we all can
appreciate that sleeping for half an hour throughout the day so that
you get a total of eight hours of sleep every 24 hour cycle is
probably very different and not optimal compared to a solid block of
eight hours of sleep. Although there are people that have tried this,
I think it's been written about in various books. Not many people can
stick to that schedule. Incidentally, I think it's called the Uberman
schedule, not to be confused with the Huberman schedule because first
of all my schedule doesn't look anything like that. And second of all
I would never attempt such a sleeping regime. The other thing that is
really important to understand is that we have not explored, as a
culture, the rhythms that occur in our waking states. So much has been
focused on the value of sleep and the importance of sleep, which is
great. But I don't think that most people are paying attention to
what's happening in their waking states and when their brain is
optimized for focus, when their brain is optimized for these DPOs,
these duration, path, outcome types of engagements for learning and
for changing and when are their brain is probably better suited for
more reflexive thinking and behaviors. And it turns out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM&amp;amp;t=3300"&gt;Leveraging Ultradian Cycles &amp;amp; Self Experimentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that there's a vast amount of scientific data which points to the
existence of what are called ultradian rhythms. You may have heard of
circadian rhythms. Circadian means, circa, about a day. So it's 24
hour rhythms because the earth spins once every 24 hours. Ultradian
rhythms occur throughout the day and they require less time, they're
shorter. The most important ultradian rhythm for sake of this
discussion is the 90 minute rhythm that we're going through all the
time in our ability to attend and focus. And in sleep, we are, our
sleep is broken up into 90 minute segments. Early in the night we have
more phase one and phase two lighter sleep. And then we go into our
deeper phase three and phase four sleep. And then we return to phase
one, two, three, four. So all night, you're going through these
ultradian rhythms of stage one, two, three, four, one, two, three,
four, it's repeating. Most people perhaps know that. Maybe they don't.
But you wake up in the morning, these ultradian rhythms continue. And
it turns out that we are optimized for focus and attention within
these 90 minute cycles so that at the beginning of one of these 90
minute cycles maybe you sit down to learn something new or to engage
in some new challenging behavior, for the first five or 10 minutes of
one of those cycles it's well-known that the brain and the neural
circuits and the neuromodulators are not going to be optimally tuned
to whatever it is you're trying to do. But as you drop deeper into
that 90 minute cycle your ability to focus and to engage in this DPO
process and to direct neuroplasticity and to learn is actually much
greater. And then you eventually pop out of that at the end of the 90
minute cycle. So these cycles are occurring in sleep and these cycles
are occurring in wakefulness. And all of those are governed by this
seesaw of alertness to calmness that we call the autonomic nervous
system. So if you want to master and control your nervous system,
regardless of what tool you reach to, whether or not it's a
pharmacologic tool or whether or not it's a behavioral tool or whether
or not it's a brain machine interface tool, it's vitally important to
understand that your entire existence is occurring in these 90 minute
cycles, whether or not you're asleep or awake. And so you really need
to learn how to wedge into those 90 minute cycles. And for instance,
it would be completely crazy and counterproductive to try and just
learn information while in deep sleep by listening to that information
because you're not able to access it. It would be perfectly good,
however, to engage in a focused bout of learning each day. And now we
know how long that focused bout of learning should be, it should be at
least one 90 minute cycle. And the expectation should be that the
early phase of that cycle is going to be challenging. It's going to
hurt. It's not going to feel natural. It's not going to feel like
flow. But that you can learn and the circuits of your brain that are
involved in focus and motivation can learn to drop into a mode of more
focus, get more neuroplasticity in other words, by engaging these
ultradian cycles at the appropriate times of day. For instance, some
people are very good learners early in the day and not so good in the
afternoon. So you can start to explore this process even without any
information about the underlying neurochemicals by simply paying
attention, not just to when you go to sleep and when you wake up each
morning, how deep or how shallow your sleep felt to you subjectively.
But also, throughout the day, when your brain tends to be most
anxious. Because it turns out that has a correlate related to
perception that we will talk about. You can ask yourself when are you
most focused? When are you least anxious? When do you feel most
motivated? When do you feel least motivated? By understanding how the
different aspects of your perception, sensation, feeling, thought, and
actions, tend to want to be engaged or not want to be engaged. You
develop a very good window into what's going to be required to shift
your ability to focus or shift your ability to engage in creative type
thinking at different times of day, should you choose. And so that's
where we're heading, going forward. It all starts with mastering this
seesaw that is the autonomic nervous system, that at a course level is
a transition between wakefulness and sleep, but at a finer level, and
just as important, are the various cycles, these ultradian 90 minute
cycles that govern our life all the time, 24 hours a day every day of
our life. And so we're going to talk about how you can take control of
the autonomic nervous system so that you can better access
neuroplasticity, better access sleep, even take advantage of the phase
that is the transition between sleep and waking to access things like
creativity and so forth. All based on studies that have been published
over the last 100 years, mainly within the last 10 years and some that
are very, very new. And that point to the use of specific tools that
will allow you to get the most out of your nervous system. So today we
covered a lot of information. It was sort of a whirlwind tour of
everything from neurons and synapses to neuroplasticity and the
autonomic nervous system. We will revisit a lot of these themes going
forward. So if all of that didn't sink in in one pass, please don't
worry. We will come back to these themes over and over again. I wanted
to equip you with a language so that we're all developing a kind of
common base set of information going forward. And I hope the
information is valuable to you in your thinking about what is working
well for you and what's working less well and what's been exceedingly
challenging, what's been easy for you in terms of your pursuit of
particular behaviors or emotional states where your challenges or the
challenges of people that you know might reside. As promised in our
welcome video, the format of the "Huberman Lab" podcast is to dive
deep into individual topics for an entire month at a time. So for the
entire month of January we're going to explore this incredible state
that is sleep and a related state, which is non-sleep deep rest and
what they do for things like learning, resetting our emotional
capacity. Everyone's probably familiar with the fact that when we're
sleep deprived we're so much less good at dealing with life
circumstances. We're more emotionally labile. Why is that? How is
that? But most importantly, we're going to talk about how to get
better at sleeping and how to access better sleep even when your sleep
timing or duration is compromised. We're also going to talk about the
data that support this very interesting state called non-sleep deep
rest where one is neither asleep nor awake, but it turns out one can
recover some of the neuromodulators and more importantly the processes
involved in sensation, perception, feeling, thought, and action. It's
sure to be a very rich discussion back and forth where I'm answering
your questions and providing tools. And I'm certain you're also going
to learn a lot of information about neuroscience and what makes up
this incredible phase of your life where you think you're not
conscious, but you're actually resetting and renewing yourself in
order to perform better, feel better, et cetera, in the waking state.
