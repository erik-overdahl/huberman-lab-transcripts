</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This episode, I explain what major depression is at the biological and
psychological level and the various treatments that peer-reviewed
studies have revealed can help prevent and treat depression. I explain
the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression:
norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic
predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and
cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss
inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review
8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding
depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival
certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against
depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more.
I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and
psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I
review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression,
especially treatment-resistant major depression.</p>

<p>-- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a
Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of
Medicine. This month, we're talking all about disorders of the mind,
things like depression, attention deficit disorders, eating disorders,
schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. During the course of this month,
we are going to discuss the psychological and biological underpinnings
of mood disorders of all kinds. You'll learn a lot of science. You'll
also learn a lot about the various treatments that exist and that are
in development for these various mood disorders. We will talk about
behavioral tools, things like exercise, meditation, breath work, but
also prescription drugs, supplements and novel compounds that are now
being tested in various clinical trials. Across the month, I think
you'll start to realize that there are common pathways underlying many
mood disorders. In fact, mood disorders that look quite different from
one another often depend on the action of the same neurochemicals or
neural circuits in the brain and body. That actually should be a point
of great relief because what it means is that by understanding the
biology of one mood disorder or understanding how one treatment or
behavioral intervention can impact a mood disorder, we gain insight
into other mood disorders as well. As always, we will discuss science
and science related tools that people could implement should they
choose. Before we dive into today's topic, I'd like to discuss a very
particular set of scientific findings that relate to today's topic,
and that are important for understanding all mood disorders and all
states of motivation, happiness, and sadness, as well as depression.
Basically, I'm going to paraphrase a brief segment of my discussion
with Dr. Anna Lembke, who I sat down with to discuss addiction and the
biological basis of addiction and addiction treatment. A very
important aspect of that discussion was when Dr. Lembke described the
pleasure pain balance, literally the circuits in our brains that
control our sense of pleasure and pain, and ultimately whether or not
we remain happy in our pursuit of pleasure or not. This is an
absolutely crucial aspect to the way that we function in everyday
life, and especially under conditions of mood disorders. The pathway
that she was describing is the so-called pleasure system. However,
what most people don't realize is that the pleasure system is also
directly associated with, and in fact is the very same system that
modulates mental or psychological anguish and pain. Essentially what
she described is that whenever we pursue something that we think will
bring us pleasure, and that could be anything that we think will bring
us pleasure from food, to video games, to sex, to a particular job or
goal, short-term or long-term, that we experience release of the
neuromodulator dopamine. Now, dopamine is associated with increased
levels of motivation and drive. It is not the molecule of reward, it
is the molecule of craving motivation and drive. However, as Dr.
Lembke pointed out, when we are in pursuit of something, there is a
release of dopamine in our brain that makes us feel motivated, and in
general, it makes us feel good. But very shortly thereafter and
beneath our conscious awareness, there is a tilt of the pleasure pain
balance in the brain, literally a shift in the neural circuits that
underlie pleasure and pain, such that every bit of pleasure or
pleasure seeking that causes release of dopamine will be balanced out
by a little bit of pain. And we don't experience this as physical
pain, at least not at first, we experience it as craving for more of
the thing that brought us pleasure. Now, that sounds pretty good. You
get pleasure and then you get a little bit of pain to balance it out.
It's subconscious and you experience it as the desire to seek out more
pleasure. However, it's actually more diabolical than that. And we
really need to keep an eye on this if we are to remain happy, if we
are to remain in pursuit of our goals. The crucial thing to understand
is that if we remain in constant pursuit of pleasure, the pain side of
the balance tips so that each time we are in pursuit of that
pleasureful thing, activity, or substance, we are going to experience,
we literally achieve less dopamine release each subsequent time. So we
get less pleasure and the amount of craving increases. Now, after a
certain point or threshold, we call that addiction. And the way to
reset the balance, and this is very important, the way to reset the
balance is actually to enter into states in which we are not in
pursuit of pleasure, to literally enter states in which we are bored,
maybe even a little bored and anxious, and that resets the pleasure
pain balance so that we can return to our pursuit of pleasure in a way
that's healthy, and then in an ongoing way, won't lead to this over
tipping or this increase in the amount of pain or addiction. So this
is very important. And if this seemed vague, what this means is we
should always be cautious of any state of mind or body or any pursuit
that leads to very large increases in dopamine. And if it does, we
should be very careful to not pursue that repeatedly over time. During
today's episode, I'm going to give an example, a real life example of
a discussion that I've been in with a young man who's 21 years old
who's dealing with a disruption in this pleasure pain balance. He is
essentially depressed and he's depressed because of his ongoing
pursuit of a particular activity that initially led to a lot of
dopamine, but over time has led to less and less dopamine and more and
more of this pain side of the balance. We could call him addicted to
that particular activity. Whether or not he's addicted by clinical
standards or not, really, isn't important. What is important is that
he experiences this as depression, as low affect as it's called or
anhedonia, an inability to experience pleasure from that thing or from
anything else. And he's currently undergoing treatment through a
rebalancing of his pleasure pain pathway. So while I can't reveal his
identity to you, that wouldn't be appropriate. He did give me
permission to reveal the general architecture of what he's coping
with. And I spent some hours with him on the phone this week, talking
to him as well as to the various people that he's working with to
really understand what's going on here 'cause I think it can
illustrate the relationship between dopamine, pleasure, and pain for
sake of addiction, but also for understanding how to avoid depressive
states, how to remove ourselves from depressive states. And as you'll
see today, as we discussed depression, many of the molecules and
neural pathways and biological mechanisms that we know can be used to
counter depression, feed back onto this pleasure pain balance. Before
we begin, I'd like to say that this podcast is separate from my
teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>

<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to
consumer information about science and science related tools to the
general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data
from blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help
you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting
regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors
that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be detected
from a quality blood test. The problem with most blood tests, however,
is that you get information back about hormone levels, metabolic
factors, et cetera, but you don't really know what to do with that
information. Some things might be flagged as too high or too low, but
really interpreting those data and taking action to bring those
numbers into the ranges that you want is what it's really about. An
InsideTracker makes all that very easy. They have a platform, it's a
dashboard that will tell you for instance, what sorts of dietary
changes or supplementation changes or exercise changes will help you
bring various hormones, metabolic factors, and other factors into the
ranges that are right for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you
can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get
25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code "huberman" at
checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've
been using athletic greens since way back in 2012. And so I'm
delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens and that I still take Athletic Greens is that
it really covers all of my foundational nutrient and micronutrient
needs. It has vitamins, minerals, and the thing that's especially
important to me these days is the probiotics, because there are so
many data that show that having a healthy gut microbiome is vital to
having a healthy immune system and for healthy gut brain axis,
literally the functioning of your brain, your mood, various aspects of
brain inflammation or limiting brain inflammation are facilitated by
having a healthy gut microbiome. And that's facilitated by getting the
proper probiotics. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you can claim their
special offer. The special offer is five free travel packs, which make
it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road or in
the car, and a year supply of vitamin D3K2. Vitamin D3K2 have been
shown to have a number of different positive health effects on
hormones, on cardiovascular health, and so on. Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim their special offer. Today's
episode is also brought to us by Belcampo. Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California that raises organic, grass fed, and
finished certified humane meats. I don't need a lot of meat. Typically
my diet regime is one in which I fast until about noon, and then I
have a lunch which is fairly low carbs. So I'll have some piece of
meat or chicken or fish and some salad typically. And then in the
evening is when I tend to emphasize carbohydrates. That helps me be
really alert during the day and sleep well at night. When I do eat
meat, I insist that the meat be of the very highest quality and that
it is sourced in humane ways. Belcampo's animals graze on open
pastures and seasonal grasses, and that results in meat that is higher
in nutrients and healthy fats. There are now a lot of data pointing to
the fact that high levels of omega-3 fatty acids are vital for mood,
for cardiovascular health and various aspects of maintaining what's
called a healthy Inflammatone, the various things in our brain and
body that maintain a healthy inflammation response, but one that
doesn't go out of whack or get unchecked in any way that is
detrimental to us. If you'd like to try Belcampo, first-time customers

<h1 id="major-depression"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=675">Major Depression</a></h1>
<p>Today we're discussing depression. In particular, we're going to talk
about major depression. The phrase major depression is used to
distinguish one form of depression from the other, the other one being
bipolar depression. Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar
disorder, is really characterized by manic highs. So where people
aren't sleeping and they're talking very fast, and they're buying
things and pursuing resources that they can't afford, they're starting
relationships left and right, they're manic, followed by periods of
crashes of feeling very low, lethargic, and so on. Bipolar depression
is an absolutely crucial thing for us to discuss. And therefore we are
going to have an entire separate episode related to bipolar
depression. Today, we're going to talk about major depression, also
sometimes called unipolar depression, just because it doesn't have the
highs and lows. It's more characterized by the lows. We're going to
talk about the biology, the psychology, and the various treatments,
behavioral, drug, supplementation, diet, exercise, all of that. Before
we go forward into the material, I just want to emphasize that any
discussion about mood disorders carries with it a particular
sensitivity, and that sensitivity is one related to self-diagnosis.
Today's episode, and indeed in the future episodes for this month on
mood disorders, you're going to hear various symptomologies that are
used to diagnose and characterize these disorders. If you recognize
some of these symptomologies in yourself or in others that you know,
that's an important thing to take note of. However, accurate diagnosis
really should be done by a qualified healthcare professional. So at
once I'm saying, keep your eyes and your ears up for things that sound
familiar to you that might be of concern. And at the same time, I'm
saying don't necessarily leap to conclusions. Take those flags of
concern if they're there and bring them to a qualified healthcare
professional, and they'll be able to properly diagnose you as having a
particular mood disorder or diagnose somebody as having a particular
mood disorder or not. And that's an essential step. I don't say this
to protect us, I said this really to protect you. Okay, let's have a
fact-based discussion about depression. And I promise you that where
we don't know certain things about depression, I will be clear to tell
you. In fact, we are going to talk about some treatments for
depression that are looking very promising, and that right now are
actually being used more and more. And from my read of the mechanistic
literature, we're still a bit in the dark as to how these work. That's
actually a common theme of medicine. Many times there are treatments
that seem promising or that look really terrific. And there isn't a
lot of understanding about mechanism. However, any good discussion
about neuroscience and in particular about mood disorders, has to get
into mechanisms. So we're going to do that. And in doing that, we're
going to frame the discussion for the tools of how to keep depression
at bay and how to deal with it if you happen to find yourself
depressed, or if you know somebody else who's depressed. What is this
thing we call depression? Was I mentioned before, it has two forms,
bipolar depression, which we're not talking about today, and major
depression, also called unipolar depression is the other. Major
depression impacts 5% of the population. That is any enormous number.
That means if you're in a class of 100 people, five of them are
dealing with major depression or have at some point. Look around you
in any environment and you can be sure that a good portion of the
people that you're surrounded by is impacted by depression, or will be
at some point. So this is something we really have to take seriously
and that we want to understand. It is the number four cause of
disability. A lot of people miss work, miss school, and before then
likely perform poorly in work or school due to major depression. Now
there's a very serious challenge in having a discussion about
depression and it relates directly to the challenges in diagnosing
depression. Earlier, I did an episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who is
indeed a medical doctor and a PhD. He's a psychiatrist. And he made a
very important point, which is that the field of psychiatry and
psychology are confronted with a challenge, which is they're trying to
understand what's going on within the stuff that's in our brains
that's deep to our skulls. We don't have access to that without brain
imaging and electrodes and things like that. Someone just comes into
the office and the dissection tool for depression so to speak is
language. In order to determine if somebody has depression or not, we
have to use language, how they talk about things, also how they carry
their body. Also some general patterns of health. So let's talk about
depression the way that clinicians talk about depression, because one
of the issues is that we use the word depression loosely. A lot of
people say, "Oh, I'm so depressed. "I didn't get this job or I'm so
depressed. "I just don't know, I had a really rough week "or I'm
exhausted. "I'm so depressed or I'm so depressed "I thought I was
going to go on vacation "and then they canceled the flight." Okay.
That is not clinical depression. That's called being bummed out, being
sad or disappointed. Now that person might be depressed, but clinical
depression actually has some very specific criteria. And those
criteria are mainly characterized by the presence of certain things
and the absence of a few particular things. So let's talk about the
things that are present in somebody that has major depression. First
of all, there tends to be a lot of grief. There tends to be a lot of
sadness. That's no surprise. The threshold to cry is often a signature
of depression. Now that doesn't mean that if you cry easily, that
you're depressed. Some people cry more easily than others, but if
you're somebody who typically didn't cry easily and suddenly you find
yourself crying very easily, that could be a sign of depression. And I
want to emphasize, could. There's also this thing that we call
anhedonia, a general lack of ability to enjoy things, things that
typically or previously we enjoyed. Things like food, things like sex,
things like exercise, things like social gatherings, a kind of lack of
enjoyment from those things. Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad,
and sometimes it's just flat, it's just kind of neutral. It doesn't
feel good because nothing there. It's like bland food. It's like these
experiences are analogous to biting into your favorite article of food
and it just not tasting very good. It just doesn't taste like anything
at all. And that's a common symptom of major depression. The other one
is guilt. Oftentimes people with depression will feel very guilty
about things they have done in the past, or they'll just generally
feel badly about themselves. And we're going to talk about this
because it relates to some of the more serious symptomology seen in
depression sometimes, things like self harm, mutilation, or even
suicide. But for the time being, we want to frame up anhedonia, this
lack of ability to achieve or experience pleasure, or kind of a flat
affect as it's called. Sometimes even delusional thinking, negative
delusional thinking, and in particular anti-self confabulation.</p>
<h1 id="anti-self-confabulation"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=1120">“Anti-Self” Confabulation</a></h1>
<p>What is anti-self confabulation? Well, first of all, confabulation is
an incredible aspect of our mind and our nervous system. You sometimes
see other forms of confabulation in people who have memory deficits
either because they have brain damage or they have age-related
dementia. A good example of this would be someone with age related
dementia sometimes will find themselves in a location in the house and
not know how they got there. And if you ask them, "Oh, what are you
doing here?" They will create these elaborate stories. "Oh, I was
thinking about going to the shopping today, "and I was going to take
the bus, "and then I was going to do this." They create these
elaborate stories, they confabulate. And yet that person hasn't left
the house in weeks and that person doesn't have a driver's license.
And so they're really just creating this stuff. They're not lying to
get out of anything, they're confabulating. It's as if a brain circuit
that writes stories, just starts generating content. In major
depression, there's often a state of delusional anti-self
confabulation, where the confabulation are not directly or completely
linked to reality, but they are ones that make the self, the person
describing them, seem sick or in some way not well. A good example
would be somebody who experiences a physical injury perhaps. Maybe
they break their ankle, maybe it's an athlete, and they also happen to
become depressed. And you'll talk to them and say, "How are things
going? "How's your rehab though?" And they go, "Oh, it's okay. And I
don't know. "I feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker by the day.
"I'm just not performing well." And then you'll talk to the person
that they're working with, their kinesiologist or whoever the physical
therapist is. And they'll say, "No, they're actually really improving.
"And I tell them they're improving, "but somehow they're not seeing
that improvement, "they're not registering that improvement." You
notice that sometimes it's subtle and sometimes it's severe, but
they'll start confabulating. You'll say, "I actually heard you're
doing much better. "You're getting better, you're taking multiple
trips "around the building now "before you could barely get out of
bed." And they'll say, "Yeah, well basically, they changed some things
"about the parking lot that make it easier to move around. "So it's
not really me." And these aren't people that are just explaining away
their accomplishments 'cause they're trying to brush off praise. They
are viewing themselves and they're confabulating according to a view
that is very self-deprecating to the point where it doesn't match up
with reality. It's not what other people see and it's actually not
matched up with reality. And that's a symptom of depression that I
think we don't often think about or conceptualize enough. So it's not
just telling people, "oh yeah, it's not as good as it seems.
Everything's bad." These people really believe that and it becomes
disconnected from reality. So it's if they're sort of sinking into a
pit and they're losing touch with the realities of the world,
including data about themselves, their ability to move and get around
it, for example, in that particular instance that I used as an
example, but there are others as well. The other common symptomology
of major depression is what they call vegetative symptoms, okay?</p>
<h1 id="autonomic-vegetative-symptoms-of-depression"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=1302">Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms of Depression</a></h1>
<p>So vegetative symptoms are symptoms that occur without any thinking,
without any doing, or without any confabulation. These are things that
are related to our core physiology. The word vegetative, you might
know it sounds like vegetable. It actually relates to a system in the
body that nowadays is more commonly called the autonomic nervous
system. The vegetative nervous system and the autonomic nervous
system, historically were considered sort of one in the same. And it
relates to things like the stress response or to our ability to sleep.
So vegetative symptoms be things like constantly being exhausted. The
person just feels exhausted. It's not because they exercise too much,
it's not necessarily because of a life event, it could be, but they're
just worn out. They don't have the energy they once had. So it's not
in their heads, it's probably, and now I think we have good data to
support the fact that there's something off, something is disrupted in
the autonomic or so-called vegetative nervous system. And one of the
most common symptoms of people with major depression, one of the signs
of major depression is early waking and not being able to fall back
asleep despite being exhausted. So waking up at 3:00 AM or 4:00 AM or
5:00 AM just spontaneously and not being able to go back to sleep. I
want to emphasize that that could happen for other reasons as well,
but it is a common symptom or warning sign of major depression. So
let's talk more about sleep and depression. It's well-known that the
architecture of sleep is disrupted in depression. What's the
architecture of sleep? I've done entire episodes about this, but very
briefly in two sentences, although they're probably be run on
sentences, early in the night, you tend to have slow wave sleep more
than REM sleep or Rapid Eye Movement sleep. As the night goes on, you
tend to have more Rapid Eye Movement sleep. That architecture of slow
wave sleep preceding Rapid Eye Movement sleep is radically disrupted
in major depression. In addition, the pattern of activity in the brain
during particular phases of sleep is disrupted. Now this is during
sleep. So this can't be that people are creating this situation for
themselves. These are real physiological signs that something is off
in this so-called autonomic or vegetative nervous system. And then
there are some other things that relate to the autonomic nervous
system, but that we normally think of as more voluntary in nature. And
these are things like decreased appetite. So you can imagine that one
could have decreased appetite because of the anhedonia, the lack of
pleasure from food, right? If you don't enjoy food, then you might be
less motivated to eat it. That makes sense. As well because of these
disruptions in the autonomic nervous system, these vegetative
symptoms, as they're called, you can imagine that someone would have
decreased appetite because some of the hormones associated with
appetite, hypocretin orexin and things of that sort, ghrelin, that
those will be disrupted. And if those names of hypocretin orexin and
ghrelin don't make any sense to you, don't worry about it. What those
are just hormones that impact when we eat, when we feel hungry, and
when we crave food more, as well as when we feel full, we have enough
so-called satiety. If you want to learn more about those, we did
entire episodes on eating and metabolism. So you can see that the
symptomology of major depression impacts us at multiple levels.
There's the conscious level of how excited we are generally. Well,
that's reduced. There's grief, there's guilt, there's crying, but then
there's also these vegetative things. There's disruptions in sleep,
which of course make everything more challenging when we're awake. We
know that sleep is so vital for resetting. You're waking up early, you
can't get back to sleep. That's going to adjust your affect, your
emotions in negative ways. We know this. And appetite is off. And
there are hormones that get disrupted. So cortisol levels are
increased. In particular, there's a signature pattern of depression
whereby cortisol, the stress hormone that normally is released in a
healthy way only in the early part of the day is shifted to late in
the day. In fact, a 9:00 PM peak in cortisol is one of the
physiological signatures of depressive like states. It's not the only
one, but it is an important one. So there are a lot of things going on
in major depression. And by now you're probably thinking, goodness,
this is dreadful. Like there's all this terrible stuff. And indeed it
is terrible. It is a terrible thing to find oneself in a mode where
things feel sad, you feel guilty, you're exhausted. And oftentimes
there's also an association with the anxiety system. So just because
people are exhausted and lethargic and they don't enjoy things,
doesn't necessarily mean that there's an absence of anxiety. There can
also be a lot of anxiety about what's going to happen to me. Am I
going to be able to achieve my goals in life? Will I ever get out of
this state? And so things really start to layer on. And if this sounds
depressing to you, it is indeed depressing. This is really the place
that many people find themselves. And it's a pit that they just don't
know how to climb out of. So let's just take a few minutes and talk
about some of the underlying biology that creates this cloud or this
constellation of symptomology.</p>
<h1 id="norepinephrine-dopamine-serotonin"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=1618">Norepinephrine, Dopamine &amp; Serotonin</a></h1>
<p>I think that's really important to do because if we want to understand
the various treatments, how they work and why they work and how to
implement them, we have to understand some of the underlying biology.
So let's spend a few minutes talking about the biology of depression,
what's known and what's not known. Because in doing that, I think
you'll get a much clearer picture about why certain tools work to
relieve depression and why others might not. So one of the most
important early findings in the search for a biological basis of
depression was this finding that there are drugs that relieve some of
the symptoms of depression. Those drugs generally fall into three
major categories, but the first set of ones that were discovered were
the so-called tricyclic antidepressants, and the MAO inhibitors, the
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. You don't need to understand that
nomenclature, but I'm going to give you a little bit of detail so that
if you want to understand it, you can. Most of this work took place in
the late 1950s and in the 1960s, and continued well until the 1980s
when new classes of drugs were discovered. And these tricyclic
antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors largely worked by increasing
levels of norepinephrine in the brain, as well as in the body, in some
cases. And they were discovered through a kind of odd set of
circumstances. We don't have time to go into all the history, but
suffice to say that they were discovered because of the exploration
for drugs that alter blood pressure. Norepinephrine impacts blood
pressure, and drugs that lower blood pressure reduce levels of
norepinephrine. And that in many cases, was shown to lead to
depression or depressive like symptoms. And so these drugs, these
tricyclic drugs, and the MAO inhibitors actually increase
norepinephrine. And frankly, they do quite a good job of relieving
some, if not all of the symptoms of major depression. However, they
carry with the many side effects. Some of those side effects are side
effects related to blood pressure itself, by increasing noradrenaline,
norepinephrine as it's called, you raise blood pressure. That can be
dangerous, that can be uncomfortable. But they also have a lot of
other side effects. The reason they have other side effects is because
they impact systems in the brain and in the body that impact things
like libido, appetite, digestion, and others. And we'll talk about
each of those in sequence. Okay, so the experience that clinicians had
of observing some relief for depression with the tricyclic
antidepressants and with MAO inhibitors was terrific, but there were
all these side effects, side effects that people really did not like,
they didn't like these drugs at all. A lot of people get dry mouth, I
mentioned the low libido, they'd have sleep issues, appetite issues,
weight gain. They made some people so uncomfortable that they
preferred not to take them, even though when they didn't take them,
they had a worsening or a maintenance of their depressive symptoms. A
decade or so later, there was the discovery of the so-called pleasure
pathways in the brain. These are pathways, literally groups of neurons
that reside in different locations in the brain but connect to one
another. So it's a circuit. And when you stimulate these neurons with
certain behaviors or with electrical stimulation in an experiment,
believe it or not, that's been done in both animals and humans,
animals and humans become very, very motivated to get more stimulation
of these pathways. So this pleasure pathway or these circuits for
pleasure are very what we call reinforcing. In fact, animals and
humans will work hard to get stimulation of these brain areas even
more than they will work to obtain sex, drugs, or even if they are
addicted to a particular drug and they are in a state of withdrawal,
the ultimate state of craving, if given a choice, a person or an
animal will select to have stimulation of this pleasure pathway
instead of the drug itself. And that is a major and significant
finding. This pleasure pathway, as it's sometimes called, involves
areas like the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area. These
are areas of the brain that are rich with neurons that make dopamine.
And if you think to the symptoms of depression, of anhedonia, lack of
pleasure, a lack of ability to experience pleasure, well, that was a
smoking gun that there's something wrong with the dopamine pathway in
depression. And indeed that's the case. So it's not just
norepinephrine, it's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway is somehow
disrupted. And then in the 1980s, there was the discovery of the so-
called SSRIs Most people are now familiar with the SSRIs, the
Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors.</p>
<h1 id="ssris-prozac-zoloft-etc-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=1910">SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</a></h1>
<p>The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms from the tricyclic
antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors. As their name suggests, SSRI,
Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors prevent serotonin from being
wiped up from the synapse after two neurons talk to one another. What
do I mean by that? Well, here's some very basic Neurobiology 101. If
you don't know any neurobiology, you're going to know some in about 15
seconds. Neurons communicate with one another by spitting out
chemicals into the little gap between them. The little gap between
them is called the synapse or by the Brits, the synapse. Those
chemicals bind to the neuron on the opposite side and cause changes in
the electrical activity of that neuron on the other side of the
synapse. Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter or more specifically,
it's a neuromodulator, can change the activity of large groups of
neurons in very meaningful ways. Selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor means when a person takes this drug, some of those drugs
include things like Prozac or Zoloft, the more typical names or more
generic names are things like fluoxetine, when people take those, more
serotonin hangs out in the synapse and is able to be taken up by the
neuron on the opposite side because of this selective re-uptake
inhibition. It prevents the clearance of serotonin from the synapse
and thereby more serotonin can have an effect. So SSRIs don't increase
the total amount of serotonin in the brain. They change how effective
the serotonin that's already in the brain is at changing the activity
of neurons, okay? So they don't increase serotonin, they increase the
efficacy or the function of serotonin in the way that I just
described. So that was more than 15 seconds, but now you understand
how SSRIs work. And I wouldn't be talking about SSRIs if they didn't
in fact work. Yes, there are many problems with SSRIs. They do carry
certain side effects in many individuals. Also, about a third of
people that take SSRIs don't derive any benefit, it doesn't relieve
their symptoms of depression. However, for the other two thirds,
there's often a relief of some, if not all of the symptoms of major
depression. The problem is the side effects that accompany those
SSRIs. And so these days SSRIs are a complicated topic. It's sort of
what I would call a barbed wire topic because we often hear about all
the problems with them, but these drugs also have saved a lot of
lives. They've also improved a lot of lives. The issue is that they
tend to have varying effects on different individuals, and sometimes
varying effects over time. So they'll work for awhile then they won't
work for a while. There are also a lot of mysteries about the SSRIs,
and those mysteries bother people. What mysteries am I referring to?
Well, SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin or more specifically,
they increase the efficacy of serotonin at the synapse, that happens
immediately, or very soon after people start taking SSRIs. But people
generally don't start experiencing any relief from their symptoms of
depression if they're going to experience them at all, until about two
weeks after they start taking these drugs. So there's something going
on there that's not clear. One idea is that the SSRIs actually can
improve symptoms of depression or even remove symptoms of depression
through so-called neuro-plasticity by changing the way that neural
circuits function. And there are many on this, but the main categories
of studies on SSRIs that relate to neuroplasticity fall into two
camps. One is that the ways in which SSRIs might, and I want to
emphasize, might be able to trigger the production of more neurons in
the brain, in particular areas of the hippocampus called the dentate
gyrus and others, that impact memory. This is important. We're going
to come back to memory. The other is that the SSRIs have been shown in
various scientific studies to reopen critical periods of plasticity.
I'll just briefly describe one of those studies. There was a study
done by Lamberto Maffei's group in Pisa, that explored brain
plasticity that's known to be present in young animals and disappear
in older animals. And this is also true in humans that younger humans
have a far more plastic brain that can change in many more ways more
easily than can the older brain. And what they showed was that
fluoxetine, Prozac, given to adult animals can reopen this incredible
period of plasticity, can allow more plasticity to occur. That was
interesting. I mean, it's purely through increases in serotonin
transmission. And there are other studies showing that fluoxetine can
increase the number of new neurons that are born into the adult brain,
so called neurogenesis, the production of new neurons. So it's very
clear that there are at least three major chemical systems in the
brain; norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin that relate to and can
adjust the symptoms of depression.</p>
<h1 id="epinephrinemotor-functions-dopaminemotivation-craving-serotoninemotions"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=2220">Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation &amp; Craving, Serotonin/Emotions</a></h1>
<p>And those actually can be divided into separate categories. So for
instance, epinephrin or norepinephrine is thought to relate to the so-
called psychomotor defects, sometimes called psychomotor retardation.
This is the lethargy, this is the exhaustion, this is the inability to
get out of bed in the morning. Dopamine is thought to relate to the
anhedonia, or I should say lack of dopamine in depressive patients is
thought to lead to the anhedonia. The lack of ability to experience
pleasure. And serotonin is thought to relate to the grief, the guilt,
some of the more cognitive or more emotional aspects of depression. So
we've got the norepinephrine system related to activity and alertness,
the dopamine system relating to motivation, pleasure, and the ability
to seek and experience pleasure, and then the serotonin system that's
related to grief. And unfortunately, brains and organisms don't work
in a simple mathematical way where you just say, oh, well, this
person's experiencing a lot of grief, but they don't have any problems
with lethargy. And so let's just boost up their serotonin. On paper it
works, but oftentimes it doesn't work clinically. And another patient,
you might get somebody who can't experience pleasure, but they're kind
of anxious. They don't have any trouble sleeping, but they're just
much more anxious and frustrated than they normally are, and they meet
the symptoms of depression. Well, you might think, oh, well, do you
just give that person some drugs increase dopamine and everything will
be better? And indeed, in some cases that's true. There are drugs like
Wellbutrin, which function more specifically on the dopamine system to
increase dopamine and they also increase norepinephrine. Many people
get great relief from things like Wellbutrin. They don't really impact
the serotonin system so much. And therefore you don't get a lot of the
serotonergic or serotonin related side effects. However, some people
feel far too anxious on those drugs, some people get addicted to those
drugs in a way, because a lot of those drugs that increase dopamine
make you want more of those drugs. So you start to realize that what
makes sense on paper doesn't always make sense clinically. And this is
why it's complicated. And a really good psychologist and a really good
psychiatrist will work with someone to try and pull and push on these
various systems to find the combination of drugs that may be or may
not be correct for them. There's a fourth aspect of the chemistry of
depression that's really important to understand. And that's pain.</p>
<h1 id="physical-emotional-pain-are-linked-substance-p"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=2373">Physical &amp; Emotional Pain are Linked: Substance P</a></h1>
<p>We've talked about pain on this podcast before, but even if you didn't
hear the episode on pleasure and pain, just want to emphasize that
pain is something that we experience in our body, no surprise there,
an injury, a cut, et cetera, but that we also experience emotional
pain. And those systems are linked in very intricate ways. There's
actually some data showing that pain relievers, Tylenol, Aspirin,
these sorts of things, can help certain people with emotional pain.
Now I'm not recommending people run out and take those things for
emotional pain. But actually, if you think about it, that shouldn't
come as any surprise. given the enormous number of people that take
painkillers, opioids and things like them to try and relieve their
psychological pain. And as we know, those drugs are very, very
problematic for many individuals. They can help certain individuals,
but they are very prone to abuse and they can induce addiction very
easily in a number of people. There's a substance that's literally
called substance P, the letter P, that's manufactured by neurons in
our brain and body, which underlies our sensation of pain. And indeed
substance P inhibitors have been used to treat depression, and in some
cases works. A lot of people with depression are hypersensitive to
pain, and of course they could have multiple things going on. They
could have chronic pain or chronic injury and major depression. So you
start to get the constellation of the many things that could happen.
So that's all I want to say today about the chemistry underlying
depression or major depression. There's a lot more there, but I think
if you understand the norepinephrine system and that it relates to
some of these things like lethargy, the psychomotor defects, as
they're called, dopamine and how it relates to motivation and lack of
motivation and lack of dopamine and depression, and serotonin and its
relationship to grief, and that low serotonin can lead to extreme
grief and shame and higher serotonin levels can sometimes restore a
sense of wellbeing and safety and feeling good about oneself. If you
understand that and you understand that physical pain is somehow
involved in certain cases, I think you will know more about depression
and its underlying chemistry than most all people out there. And if
you'd like to learn more, I invite you to pursue searching those terms
further on the internet. And we'll certainly go into them in more
depth. But that really sets the stage for where we're headed next.</p>
<h1 id="hormones-depression-thyroid-cortisol"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=2510">Hormones &amp; Depression: Thyroid &amp; Cortisol</a></h1>
<p>So next I'd like to talk about hormones and how they relate to
depression. And I'd also like to talk about stress and how it relates
to depression, as well as talk about some of the genetics or the
predispositions to depression. And for those of you that are thinking,
hey, I want the tools. I want to know how to fix depression. I
understand the desire for that. I will just ask if you hang in here
with me a little bit longer, not only will you learn a lot more about
how this complicated mood disorder works, some of the more interesting
things about it, but it will also position you to get a lot more out
of the tools that we will describe. You always have the option to skip
forward of course, but I think it's important to understand some of
the hormonal and stress-related aspects of depression. So let's talk
about hormones. 20% of people that have major depression have low
thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is related to metabolism. Oftentimes
we think about thyroid is only related to having a fast metabolism,
but thyroid is related to all forms of metabolism, including our
ability to synthesize new tissues like protein and repair injuries. I
did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone. If you want to
check that out, all of that is archived at hubermanlab.com. It's all
timestamped, et cetera. You can find on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, all
those places. So if you're curious about thyroid hormone and growth
hormone, and you want to do the deep dive on those, and you want to
learn how to alter their levels using various approaches, check that
out. But 20% of people with major depression are hypo thyroidal. They
don't make enough thyroid. And that leads to low energy, low
metabolism in the brain and body. And there's a condition called
Hashimoto's, which is essentially low thyroid output. And again, I
don't want to get into all the tools related to thyroid. Sometimes a
psychiatrists will prescribe thyroid medication to increase thyroid
output in people that are depressed and that will work to relieve the
symptoms. So there isn't necessarily a direct problem with serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine or substance abuse. Sometimes it's a
thyroid problem. So there are certain situations or conditions that
can impact the thyroid hormone system and make people more susceptible
to depression or make a pre-existing depression worse. And those are
things like childbirth. So it's well-known that women who give birth
can often undergo what's called postpartum depression. It actually
comes from the word post parturition depression. They give birth,
what's happier, what's more joyful than the birth of a new healthy
child, and they will lapse into a depression. And that's thought to be
hormonally related, either directly to the thyroid system or perhaps
to the cortisol system as well. We'll talk about cortisol in a moment.
As well, certain women during certain phases of their menstrual cycle
experience symptoms that are very much like clinical depression, and
oftentimes are diagnosed with clinical depression appropriately. And
of course the menstrual cycle is associated with shifts in hormone
levels. As well, menopausal and post-menopausal women are more
susceptible to major depression, regardless of whether or not they've
had that major depression earlier in their life. So these are things
to be on the lookout for and to definitely talk to a doctor and get a
blood panel that hopefully includes measures of thyroid hormone and
cortisol hormone. Why cortisol hormone? Well more stress is correlated
with more bouts of major depression across the lifespan. How many
bouts? Well, it turns out that as you go from having one to two to
three, well, when you hit four to five bouts of really intense,
stressful episodes in life, these tend to be long-term stressful
episodes, your risk for major depression goes way up. So whether or
not you have a genetic predisposition to depression or not, one of the
best things you can do to try and avoid getting depressed is to learn
to control your stress system, to not go from short-term stress, which
everybody experiences, we all have short-term stressors, to medium
term stress to long-term stress, and to not have too many bouts of
long-term stress because that probability of getting depressed goes
way, way up. And this is something I've seen over and over again, not
just in my scientific career, but just throughout life. People in all
sorts of domains, young and old, I've seen that people will go through
a very intense relationship, a breakup, sometimes it's the staying
together that stressful, sometimes it's a graduate school that can be
stressful, sometimes it's some other event. And then some months later
they become depressed. And that's because the stress system is
associated with the release of cortisol. The cortisol system can
dramatically impact the way that these different neuromodulators,
dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin function. And so there's this
kind of latent or longer lasting impact on the systems that impact
mood and wellbeing. So learning how to control your stress is really
key. If you're not depressed or you're somebody that has not lapsed
into a depression recently, take control of your stress system. And we
did an entire episode on how to conquer stress, and that involves
dealing with stress in the short term, the medium term, and in the
long-term.</p>
<h1 id="genetic-susceptibility-to-depression-impact-of-stress"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=2810">Genetic Susceptibility to Depression: Impact of Stress</a></h1>
<p>And there are a lot of different ways to do that. One of the more
important reasons for learning how to counter stress in order to
offset depression is that there is a genetic predisposition that
certain people carry to become depressed. There are these studies now
of many, many thousands of individuals, these were mainly done in New
Zealand, but these studies have now been done elsewhere, looking at
many tens of thousands of individuals who carry particular copies of
genes, what they call polymorphisms, in particular of a gene called
5HTTLPR, which is a serotonin transporter. So this is a gene that
controls or regulates how much serotonin is available in the brain. If
you have this gene, this polymorphism, it doesn't necessarily mean
that you will be depressed, but it greatly shifts your susceptibility
to depression under conditions of stress. So I realize some people are
listening to this and some people are watching it on YouTube. So I'm
going to describe this in a way that doesn't require looking at any
graphs. What I want you to imagine is a very, shallow hill, like a
very mellow hill. It's just a ramp set at about 10 or 15 degrees,
okay. What we're plotting there in your mind is that with each about
of serious stress, so that could be trying to finish a degree or a
relationship breakup, or a family member that's sick, or the loss of a
loved one or a pet, with each about of stress, the probability that
you will experience a major depression goes up. However, if you carry
this gene, this HTTLPR gene, the steepness of that curve goes way, way
up where it's actually more like a line such that you need far fewer
bouts of stress in order to lapse into a major depression, okay? So if
the typical person who doesn't carry this polymorphism has to
experience two or three or four or five bouts of stress before they
lapse into a depression, somebody with this gene is susceptible to
getting depression after just one about or two bouts of intense
stress, okay? So that's how these genes work. They don't preordain or
determine you to be depressed. They raise a susceptibility. And many
genes, many things related to heritability in general, work in that
way. And we know there's a strong genetic component to depression. How
do we know? Well, in what are called concordant monozygotic twins. So
these will be identical twins. And they can either be in one
biological sack or two biological sacks while in utero, what's called
monochorionic or dichorionic. Well, typically it's monochorionic. And
identical twins, for which one of those twins goes on to have major
depression, there's a 50% probability that the other one will have
major depression. So it's not 100%, it's not 100% inherited, it's not
100% generic, as you might say, but there's a much higher
predisposition for depression. Whereas in fraternal twins, that number
drops, and in siblings, that number drops to about 25%, and in half
siblings, it's about 10%. The numbers vary from study to study, but
basically the more closely related you are to somebody who has major
depression, the more likely it is that you will also get major
depression. And therefore, if you haven't gotten major depression, the
more likely it is that you should take steps to learn to mitigate
stress because stress is the major factor that can trigger one of
these depressive episodes. So we've covered a lot related to the
stress and the hormones and the neurochemistry of depression. In fact,
I think this is probably the deepest I've ever gone into the biology
of any topic on this podcast before getting to any specific tools. I
mentioned that learning how to mitigate stress and deal with stress,
learning how to measure and adjust your thyroid hormone, those might
be useful.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-biological-mechanism-is-key-recipes-versus-skills"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=3050">Understanding Biological Mechanism Is Key: Recipes versus Skills</a></h1>
<p>But next I'd like to turn to some very specific tools that people who
both have depression or who are prone to depression, as well as people
who don't have depression and simply want to maintain a good mood, who
want to maintain a positive affect and pursuit of things in life, what
are the things that you can do? It turns out there are things that you
can do and all of the biology that underlies the utility of those
things. Meaning the reasons those things work will now make sense to
you because they adjust things like serotonin and dopamine, and they
adjust them through very specific pathways. I know for many people
learning about mechanism is kind of grueling. I realized this podcast
isn't necessarily one that you can listen to passively while doing
other things. Although I would hope that you could do that and still
enjoy it and extract the information. Why mechanism? Mechanism is so
key because mechanism is a little bit like understanding some of the
chemistry of cooking. If you read a recipe and you can follow a
recipe, you often hear people say, oh, I can follow a recipe. That
means that if you have every ingredient in that recipe, you're good.
You likely can make that dish. You can make that meal. However, if you
understand a little bit of the chemistry of why salt has to be added
third and not first, or why the heat has to be adjusted at a
particular time, well then not only can you follow a recipe, but that
also gives you flexibility for when salt isn't available, or when you
want to adjust the flavor of the dish, or when you want to try a new
dish, or you want to get experimental. So when you understand
mechanism, it puts you in a tremendous place of power to work with
your system. So it's not just plug and chug, like take 12 milligrams
of this, you either feel better or you don't. You can really start to
understand how prescription drugs, supplements, nutrition, behavioral
tools, how those things weave together to either work for you or not
work for you and get you to paths of healthy mind and body. So let's
think about why any tool would work to relieve depression.</p>
<h1 id="tools-for-dealing-with-depression-logic-implementation-protocol-2"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=3170">Tools for Dealing with Depression: Logic &amp; Implementation (Protocol 2)</a></h1>
<p>We've talked about how some of the drugs that impact these different
chemical systems might work and why they create some of the problems
they create. Problems are mainly created by the fact that they impact
lots of systems in the brain and body. So you take a drug to increase
serotonin, but that serotonin is also related, not just to mood, but
to things related to libido and appetite. And so you start disrupting
multiple systems. The same could be said for behavioral tools, right?
That any behavioral tool that adjusts the levels of a particular
chemical ought to perhaps, provide some relief for some of the
symptoms of major depression. Let's take an example that I've talked
about before on the podcast, which is, if you get into a very cold
shower, you take an ice bath, you will release norepinephrine and
epinephrine in your brain and body. There's no question about that. I
don't think anyone can really escape that. It's a kind of a universal
response to being in cold water. Well, if some aspects of depression
are related to low levels of norepinephrine, will taking cold showers
relieve your depression? Perhaps it might even relieve certain aspects
of that depression. Is it a cure? Well, that's going to depend on the
individual. Will exercise help? Well, if you go out for a run, you're
going to increase the amount of norepinephrine in your body. If you
enjoy that run, it's likely that you'll increase the levels of
dopamine and probably serotonin in your brain and body as well. Will
that cure your depression? Well, there are a lot of studies exploring
how exercise can impact depression. And indeed, regular exercise is
known to be a protective behavior against depression, but it also can
help relieve some of the symptoms of depression. So you may ask
yourself, why would you need drugs at all? Why would there be
prescription drugs or the need for supplementation or other things to
alleviate the symptoms of depression? Ah, well, that's the diabolical
nature of depression, which is if people are far enough along in this
thing, this sometimes called disease, sometimes called disorder, but
major depression, oftentimes they can't get the energy to even get up
and take a bath or a shower. They have no motivation to do it, they
have no desire to go for a run. So you say, "Come on, let's go, you'll
feel better. "I know you feel better, it generates all these chemicals
"I heard on the whatever podcast, Huberman Lab podcast, "or another
podcast that getting into action "does all these things." And they
just don't want to do it. And to you, a person who's not experiencing
depression, that perhaps could just seem like the most frustrating and
confusing thing in the world. But it's very important to highlight the
fact that these circuits that are accessible to some of us, the
circuits for happiness, for pursuit of pleasure, for exercise, for
getting in a cold shower, if that's your thing, that those circuits
are present in all people, but for certain people that are
experiencing major depression and are really in the depths of their
depression, they can't really access those circuits in the same way
that people who are not suffering from depression can. So I hope that
makes it clear. It's not offering any excuses for them. And indeed, I
think those behaviors would help jolt them out of some of the
symptomology of depression, but they're just not accessible to
everybody. So let's talk about the things that people can do to deal
with depression. And again, anytime you add a behavior or a tool or a
supplement, or subtract a behavior, tool, supplement, drug, et cetera,
you absolutely should talk to your physician, especially if you're
somebody that's dealing with major depression.</p>

<p>I want to focus on the stress system. And I'm not just going to tell
you to get sunlight in your eyes and to get a good night's sleep,
although I think everybody should do that on a regular basis, ideally
every day, talked about those ad nauseum on this podcast. They will
help your sleep, they will help you alleviate stress. I think you
should have tools to deal with stress in real time, et cetera. But
let's look at depression from the standpoint of a deeper biological
phenomenon, which is inflammation and the immune system. There's
growing evidence now that many forms of major depression, if not all
of them, relate to excessive inflammation. Now inflammation plays an
important role in wound healing. It is a positive aspect of our immune
system. Our ability to combat wounds, combat illnesses, et cetera, but
inflammation gone unchecked, inflammation that lasts too long, or is
of too high amplitude, meaning too many anti-inflammatory or
inflammatory cytokines and things of that sort in the body is bad. And
there's decent evidence now that inflammation can lead to or
exacerbate depression. And that if we want to control depression, or
limit or eliminate depression, that focusing on reducing inflammation
and its associated pathways is a really good thing to do. And I think
this is a really good thing for everybody to do regardless of whether
or not you suffer from depression or not. And today we're going to
talk about exactly how depression comes about through the inflammation
pathway. So, first of all, who are the major players in creating
chronic inflammation in the brain and body? They are the inflammatory
cytokines. Things like IL-6, interleukin-6, things like Tumor Necrosis
Alpha, TNF alpha, things like C reactive protein, alright? Not all of
these are cytokines. You have interferons and prostoglandins and a lot
of these things. But when we are stressed, chronically stressed, we
get inflamed, our brain and various locations of the brain become
inflamed because certain classes of cells, in particular, those glial
cells, the cells that are typically thought to just be support cells,
those cells and their biochemistry and their dialogue with the neurons
of the brain and body starts to become disrupted. I may have mentioned
it earlier, I don't recall. But I certainly mentioned it in an earlier
podcast that adrenaline epinephrin, when it's released in the body, it
doesn't cross the blood brain barrier, but there are certain things
that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier when we are stressed.
Things like the E2 prostoglandins, those cross the blood brain
barrier. And our blood and our brain, therefore our brain and our body
can communicate because certain things can pass through this barrier
we call the BBB or the Blood Brain Barrier. And also we have something
called the glymphatic system, which is really a plumbing system that
links the brain and body. It's the link between the immune system and
the brain. Well, there is a set of actions that we can take in order
to limit inflammation.</p>
<h1 id="protocol-3-essential-fatty-acids-omega-3-epas-eicosapentaenoic-acid"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=3560">Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)</a></h1>
<p>And this has been shown in several quality peer reviewed studies now
to reduce inflammation and to relieve some, and in some cases, all of
the symptoms of major depression. One of those approaches is to
increase our intake of so-called EPAs or Essential Fatty Acids.
There's now a very long list of papers in quality peer review journals
showing that when people ingest a certain level of EPA omega-3 fatty
acids, the relief from depressive symptoms matches the SSRIs. That's
incredible, right? That essential fatty acids could relieve symptoms
of depression, as well as some of the prescription antidepressants.
Now, this doesn't necessarily mean you run off and stop taking your
antidepressants if you've been prescribed them, please don't do that.
Please talk to your physician. And I should mention that some of the
same studies have shown that increasing our intake of these essential
fatty acids, in particular, the EPA variety of omega-3s, can lower the
effective dose of things like SSRIs. Meaning if we required a 50
milligram or 40 milligram dose of fluoxetine, that one can get by on a
lower dose and thereby perhaps not experience as many or as severe
side effects by taking or supplementing with EPAs. Now, the threshold
level seems to be about one gram, 1000 milligrams of EPA. So you will
sometimes see on a bottle of krill oil or fish oil or any other
source, even plant source or other source of EPA that it's 1000
milligrams or 1200 milligrams. But what's really important to look at
is whether or not there's more than 1000 milligrams of EPA, because
the EPA in particular is what's important here. And actually in
exploring some of the literature on the effects of EPAs on
cardiovascular health, excuse me, as well as their effects on
depression, there's some interesting dose dependent responses, such
that people who took anywhere from 400 milligrams to 5,000 milligrams
of EPAs, achieved a variety of different benefits. And in some cases,
some side effects, we'll talk about those. And it does seem that this
1000 milligrams is the critical threshold for benefiting or getting
some relief from depressive symptoms. But people who took two grams
seem to do better. And in the cardiovascular health realm, there it's
a little more complicated. Some studies point to a very positive
effect on cardiovascular health by taking increasing amounts of EPA,
others, not so much. The current data point to the fact that for every
gram of EPA that one ingest, there's about a 9% improvement in
cardiovascular health, the same dose dependent improvement on
psychological health in combating depression can't really be stated. I
wouldn't say that the more EPA you take, the better you're going to
feel so to speak. I don't think the data point to that. However, it
does seem that if you take a gram, 1000 milligrams or 2000 milligrams
of EPA, there does seem to be some substantial relief for many people,
should emphasize many, not all, for many people in major depressive
symptoms. So how would this work? Well, turns out that these
inflammatory cytokines, they impact neurons and the circuits of the
brain that relate to things like serotonin, dopamine, and
norepinephrine.</p>
<h1 id="how-epas-help-offset-depression-serotonin-synthesis-kynurenine-quinolinic-acid"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=3770">How EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine, Quinolinic Acid</a></h1>
<p>These inflammatory cytokines act in a variety of different ways, but
they mainly act to inhibit the release of serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine, or the synthesis of serotonin, norepinephrine and
dopamine. And I'll give you one example of how EPAs can positively
impact this process. And then it points to a second tool, which is the
proper utilization of exercise to offset the effects of depression. So
now you should understand why having healthy levels of serotonin is
important for maintaining healthy mood. It's not responsible for all
the aspects of having a healthy mood, there's also dopamine and
norepinephrine, but it is a very important one. Dopamine also called
5HT, essentially derives from a precursor called tryptophan.
Tryptophan arrives into our system through our diet, okay, tryptophan
is an amino acid. Tryptophan is found in Turkey, it's found in
carbohydrates. And that should therefore raise the idea, hmm, I wonder
if one of the reasons why people who are depressed have such an
appetite for carbohydrate late in foods is because they're trying to
get more tryptophan, and therefore more serotonin. And indeed that's
the case. Tryptophan is eventually converted into serotonin. However,
if there's excessive amounts of inflammation, these inflammatory
cytokines cause tryptophan to not be converted so much into serotonin,
but to be diverted down a different pathway. The pathway involves
something called IDO, Indoleamine, which converts tryptophan into
kynurenine. Kynurenine actually acts as a neurotoxin by way of
converting into something called quinolinic acid. And quinolinic acid
is pro depressive. So if that seems like a complicated biochemical
pathway, what's basically happening here is that the tryptophan that
normally would be made into serotonin, under conditions of
inflammation is being diverted into a neurotoxic pathway. And
ingestion of EPAs, because it limits these inflammatory cytokines,
things like IL-6, C-reactive protein, et cetera, can cause more of the
tryptophan that one ingests or has in their body to be diverted
towards the serotoninergic pathway.</p>
<h1 id="protocol-4-how-exercise-offsets-depression"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=3925">Protocol 4: How Exercise Offsets Depression</a></h1>
<p>Exercise, it turns out, also has a positive effect on the tryptophan
to serotonin conversion pathway. And the way it does it is really
interesting. You now know that tryptophan can either be converted into
serotonin or it can be converted into this neurotoxin, which is a bad
thing. Exercise, the activation of the muscles through rhythmic
repeated use, in particular aerobic exercise, but also resistance
training has been shown to do this to some extent, tends to sequester
or shuttle the contouring into the muscle so that it isn't converted
into this neurotoxin that is pro depression, okay? There are a lot of
steps in the pathway leading to depression, but what this essentially
means is that hitting a certain threshold level of EPA intake, whether
by supplementation with fish oil or krill oil or through some plant
source if you're not into ingesting fish or krill, or trying to get up
above that 1000 milligram threshold for EPA by ingesting particular
food sources, you certainly can do it through food, you don't have to
supplement, but it's easier to do with supplements, that doing that
will limit the inflammation that diverts tryptophan into this
neurotoxic pathway. And exercise as well, augments this conversion of
tryptophan into serotonin because it takes this thing that would
potentially be a neurotoxin and it sequesters it, it pulls it away so
that it can't actually go have its pro depressive effects. So you've
got multiple steps here. We're describing two tools, increasing EPA
and regular exercise as a way of increasing serotonin, somewhat
indirectly, right? It's by limiting this bad pathway to promote the
activity of a good pathway. But from the data that are published in
Quality Peer Review journals, it really appears that this inflammation
pathway does function to increase depression through these pathways.
And so knowing that there are behavioral steps and supplementation
based steps, or if you prefer getting your EPAs from typical food,
from nutritional approaches, I find that very reassuring that the
mechanisms all converge on a common pathway, serotonin. That gives me
great peace of mind that when people say, hey, go out for a run, or
you should get outdoors exercise, or you should take fish oil like the
Scandinavians do, I have Scandinavian family members and they are
known to, or I should say they are quite open about the fact that
during the winter months in particular when depression is more likely,
but throughout the year, really, they make an effort to regularly
ingest high levels of EPA, either through ingesting fatty fish and its
skin, I'm not a particular fan of ingesting the skin of fatty fish, or
by supplementing with Cod liver oil or other types of fish oil,
sardines, and things of that sort, sardine oils. There are a number of
different things out there that one could use. So I find it very
reassuring that there's a common biochemical pathway that can explain
why these things not just work, but why they should work. They should
work because they operate in the very same biochemical pathways that
antidepressants that are prescribed to people do. So what does this
mean for you? Well, if you're somebody who suffers from major
depression, again, don't stop taking your prescribed medication. Talk
to your doctor, but talk to them perhaps about the EPAs and exercise
and how these things can impinge on the same biochemical pathways. If
you're somebody who is not suffering from major depression, I still
think these pathways are really important to understand. And actually
knowing these pathways is additional motivation to get regular
exercise. I think we all know that we should be getting anywhere from
150 minutes to 180 minutes per week of so-called zone two cardio for
cardiovascular effects. Zone two is the kind of melowish cardio where
you can sort of hold a conversation if you needed to. But it's a
little bit tough, you're kind of sucking for air a little bit. And
that's going to limit these depressive like symptoms, I think in all
of us. I don't think that we should think of depression as a strict
threshold. I'm somebody who personally has made the choice to take
1000 milligrams of EPA per day. I do that by supplementing fish oil.
There's debate out there as to whether or not it's better to take EPA
NDHA in particular ratios, and whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,
which is the so-called bad cholesterol. That's getting really down
into the weeds. And we can talk about that in a future episode. But
for myself, I notice a pretty substantial positive effect of taking
anywhere from 1000 milligrams to 2000 milligrams of EPA per day. I do
that through supplementation and I do strive to try and eat some fish,
even though frankly, I've never liked the taste of fish. For those of
you that would like a little more detail or perhaps a lot more detail
into the effects of EPA on depression and in relieving depressive
symptoms, and if you want to get into the nitty gritty of it, I invite
you to go to examine.com, put in depression, EPA, they list off and
have links to 28 studies on the effects of EPA on major depression. If
you go to pub med, there are many, many studies on this now that date
back several decades, really. If you're interested in the specific
effects of EPA, as opposed to DHA, I want to point you towards a
particular study entitled, not surprisingly EPA, but not DHA appears
to be responsible for the efficacy of omega-3 long chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation and depression, evidence
from a meta analysis of randomized control trials. This is a really
wonderful paper. The author is Julian Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S. It was
published in 2009. We will provide a link to this study in the
caption. And that study is really the one that at least to me, points
to why EPA in particular is what's effective, and that whether or not
DHA is problematic or not as a separate issue, but it's really the EPA
that one wants to hit a certain threshold level of if one's goal is to
get relief from depression or to keep depression at bay by keeping
mood elevated, which is why I take a high-dose EPA. So we've got EPA,
we got exercise, now you understand how they work to adjust mood. Now,
I want to talk about something that at least for me, was quite
surprising when I first learned about it for sake of treatment of mood
disorders, and that's creatine.</p>
<h1 id="protocol-5-creatine-monohydrate-forebrain-function-nmda-receptors"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=4304">Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function &amp; NMDA receptors</a></h1>
<p>Creatine has a number of very important functions throughout the body.
For those of you that are into resistance training, and actually for
those of you that are into endurance training as well, creatine has
achieved a lot of popularity in recent years because supplementation
with creatine can draw more water into muscles and can increase power
output from muscles. So it's something that does indeed work. There
have been debates about whether or not it's unhealthy for the kidneys
to take long-term creatine, supplementation at high doses. And I
invite you to go down that rabbit hole. I think most people now accept
the idea that for most people, not all, but for most people, low dose
creatine supplementation of anywhere from one gram to five grams per
day can have a number of positive effects on physical performance.
People with kidney issues, et cetera, need to be especially cautious,
but creatine is interesting for that purpose. However, there's also a
so-called phosphocreatine system in the brain, and that
phosphocreatine system has everything to do with the dialogue between
neurons and these other cell types called, glial, and glial comprise
several cell types, microglia, astrocytes, et cetera, but the foster
creatine system in the forebrain in particular, in the front of our
brain, has been shown to be involved in regulation of mood and some of
the reward pathways as well as in depression. And there are now
several studies, at least three, although they're probably more by the
time this comes out because they're coming out very quickly now, at
least three quality studies pointing to the fact that creatine
supplementation doesn't just have these positive effects on physical
performance, but can also be used as a way to increase mood and to
improve the symptoms of major depression. This has been now done in
several double blind placebo controlled studies. The studies have
looked at women, have it looked at men, have looked at adolescents,
some of whom were taking SSRIs, some of whom were not, they've done
magnetic resonance spectroscopy. So spectroscopy is a way that you can
look at the concentrations of particular in the brain in real time in
humans, it can be used for other things as well, of course. And
basically what's been observed is that increasing the activity of the
phosphocreatine system in the forebrain can be beneficial or at least
is correlated with improvements in mood. So let's just talk for a
moment about what's involved with using or supplementing creatine in
order to improve mood and perhaps even treat depression. First of all,
when I talk about creatine, I'm talking about creatine monohydrate,
there are a number of different forms of creatine. Here I'm talking
about creatine monohydrate. The American Journal of Psychiatry in
2012, published a study, which was a randomized, double blind placebo
controlled trial of oral creatine monohydrate. And what it found is
that it could augment or enhance the response to a selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor, in particular, in women with major depressive
disorder. So like EPA, creatine supplementation seems to either lower
the required dose of SSRI that's required to treat depression, or can
improve the effectiveness of a given dose of SSRI. However, there are
other studies that have looked directly at creating supplementation in
the absence of SSRIs. And those are interesting as well. There's a
wonderful and very comprehensive review on creatine for the treatment
of major depression that includes beautiful tables of all the subjects
and the dosages, et cetera. I'm not going to read off every line and
every column in that review, but we will provide a link to that review
as well. One of the things that's really striking about the lists of
studies that they include is that most of them used dosages that are
pretty reasonable for most people, anywhere from three grams to five
grams, sometimes up to as many 10 grams per day of creatine. Many of
these also were shown to increase activity of this phosphocreatine
system in the forebrain, and some show a relationship between that
phosphocreatine system and a particular category of receptors in the
brain called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor. The
NMDA receptor is one of the first things that every budding
neuroscientists learns about because it is the receptor that has
particular electrical and chemical properties that make it a critical
gate for so-called neuroplasticity. So it's not a receptor that's
activated in the brain, typically for just the functioning of the
brain on a day-to-day basis. It's a receptor that's activated when
circuits are going to change, when they are inspired to change by some
very strong stimulus, meaning some experience, or in some cases a
drug, or in some cases something else. But the NMDA receptor is a kind
of a key node for shifting brain circuitry. And so while the details
aren't entirely clear, it seems that creatine supplementation leads to
increases in the phosphocreatine system in the forebrain. And that
increases in the activity of the forebrain phosphocreatine system
relate to changes in the way the NMDA receptors function and may lead
to some of the plasticity, the changes in neural circuits that
underlie the shift from negative mood and affect to positive mood.
Now, there are a lot of gaps. There are a lot of little boxes or bins
in the diagram I just laid out for you. And some of them are still
truly black boxes, as we say, meaning, we don't really know what's in
them yet. And more mechanistic data are coming. However, when you look
over the data in this review, or when I look over the data in this
review, what you find is that they're pretty striking positive effects
of creatine. And one of the more interesting effects is that creatine
has actually been shown to increase mania in people that are already
manic. And that's interesting, we're not talking about bipolar
depression today, but it seems that creatine elevates levels of
activation and kind of mood overall. And you could see why that would
be a problem for somebody that's already in a manic phase, but it
actually might be beneficial for somebody who is very low affect and
has major depression. So should you supplement with creatine? Well, as
always, talk to your healthcare provider, but if you're somebody who
is thinking about things that you can do and things that you can take
in order to improve your mood, keep depression at bay, maybe even
support other treatments for major depression. the creatine system
seems like a logical one. There's at least strong studies and a good
number of them to look to, to determine whether or not that's right
for you. I personally take five grams of creatine for other reasons. I
take it for the physical performance, enhancing effects, but it's kind
of nice to think that perhaps it's also helping me improve my mood.
That's a choice that I've made for me is in within the margins of
safety for me in my life. I don't know that it's right for everybody,
but I find it very interesting. And again, I find it particularly
interesting because there's a logical biochemical pathway to support
the finding that it improves mood and can offset the effects of major
depression in some cases, or can improve the effects of antidepressant
medication in many cases. When I see mechanism and I see
effectiveness, and the mechanism and the effectiveness map to a lot of
the same mechanisms that are involved in prescription drugs, that
gives me great reassurance that this isn't just some sort of
mysterious pathway or mysterious compound by which a creatine might be
working. So now we've kind of clustered together EPAs, exercise, and
their relationship to inflammation, creatine and its relationship to
forebrain function, and the phosphocreatine system, and this NMDA
receptor. And as you'll see in a few minutes, that NMDA receptor turns
out to be vitally important and is actually one of the main nodes of
action for some of the more novel and exciting therapeutics that are
being explored now in psychiatric clinics. So let's talk a little bit
more about this NMDA receptor and how it relates to some of the more
experimental or novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment of major
depression.</p>
<h1 id="protocol-6-ketamine-pcp-prescription-only-nmda-receptor-function"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=4830">Protocol 6<em>: Ketamine, PCP (</em>Prescription-Only), &amp; NMDA-Receptor Function</a></h1>
<p>And the compounds that we're going to be talking about, you may have
heard of before, one is ketamine, which is getting increasing interest
in psychiatric clinics and in various experimental and clinical
studies, and the other is PCP. Both ketamine and PCP are known drugs
of abuse. For many years, people have abused these drugs, go by the
street name, special K, et cetera. And they create dissociative
anesthetic states. So dissociative states where people don't feel as
closely meshed with their emotions and their perceptions. It's an odd
state, I hear. And it's an odd state that clinicians are now
leveraging for the treatment of depression. And we'll talk about why
that is, but let's talk a little bit about this NMDA receptor and why
ketamine and PCP might work for the treatment of depression or how
they even could work. I want to be very direct that this is an area
that still needs a lot of data. There are however, some excellent
papers from really terrific groups. One of them is a paper that was
published in nature last year, 2020. First author is Vesuna, Sam
Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A, and the last author and the lead on the study,
who was Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who was a guest on the Huberman Lab
podcast a few months ago. He's world expert in neuroscience, he's a
psychiatrist. And this paper from Sam Vesuna and Karl and colleagues
explored how these dissociative states come about. And they looked at
this both in animals and in humans and found that there was a,
essentially a common mechanism whereby a particular layer of cortex,
so your brain has this outer shell of tissue that is called the
neocortex. It's where our perceptions lie, it's where our associations
lie, it's a very important area for processing decision-making and
planning, et cetera. It's literally stacks of cells, and one of those
layers in the stack of cells is layer five. And the layer five neurons
in particular, went into a particular rhythm of electrical activity,
this one to three Hertz rhythm after mice or humans were administered
ketamine or PCP. There was activation of a particular area of the
brain, this retro splenium cortex as it's called. And the dissociative
state that emerged was an interesting one. And clinically what's
described in the trials for ketamine and things like it, that people
who are depressed will take ketamine, will experience a kind of
separateness from their grief and from their emotions. And that
possibly there's plasticity, there actually shifts in the neural
circuitry, such that their emotions don't weigh on them so heavily,
I'm using very loose language here, but that they don't feel as over
written or as burdened by their own emotions as they did previously to
the ketamine therapy. Now, absolutely in no way, shape or form am I
suggesting that people run out and take ketamine in order to treat
their own depression. These drugs are still very much experimental,
although they are approved in certain contexts, at least in the U S,
by prescription for the treatment of depression. What's interesting to
me is that these dissociative states sound at least at the outset to
be more of a separateness from everything. It sounds a little bit like
depression itself. That's sort of like anhedonia and an inability to
experience pleasure. And then one takes a dissociative anesthetic and
somehow is able to get relief by getting even further away from an
experience. To me, that doesn't make sense, but that just speaks to
the fact that these drugs and these receptors and these pathways
operate through very cryptic means. And we really don't understand all
the pathways in the brain that relate to motivation and mood and so
forth. And the results with these ketamine trials are looking very
promising. In fact, there are a number of trials that show that a fair
number of people that take ketamine in a therapeutic setting legally
with a psychiatrist guiding the experience are able to get relief from
their symptoms without the need for many, many treatments with the
drug. Just how many treatments varies from individual to individual,
but it's not like people have to take this stuff ongoing. This is
really an attempt to tap into this NMDA receptor that is related to
neuroplasticity. Both ketamine and PCP essentially act as antagonists,
which means they block the NMDA receptor. They do it through different
methods, non-competitive and competitive for you chemists and
pharmacologists out there. You can look it up if you like. But what's
therefore even more surprising is that every neuroscientist learns
that activation of the NMDA receptor, not antagonism or blocking of
the NMDA receptor leads to changes in neural circuitry in very
profound ways. In fact experimentally, and I've done these experiments
myself, if you want to prevent plasticity, you want to prevent an
experience from reshaping neural circuitry, you give an MDA receptor
blocker. I've done that many times in the course of my experimental
neuroscience career, not to myself, obviously, but in the course of
doing experiments. So it's still a bit mysterious to me how this could
work. A couple things. One is this layer five activation is pretty
interesting. We're going to come back to layer five when we talk about
yet another emerging treatment for depression, which has psilocybin,
so-called magic mushrooms, and the effects of psilocybin on layer five
neurons in the cortex. So there's a common theme emerging here, which
is that layer five activity in the cortex may be important for
rewiring the brain in certain ways that can lead to recovery or to an
alleviation of some of the symptoms of major depression. So if this is
sounding a little bit vague to you, it's because this is still truly
experimental and new, and still very much on the cutting edge of
what's happening now. We don't have all the answers. So if it sounds
like I'm moving slowly through this, and I'm being extra careful about
what I say, you are correct. Your antenna are correct in this case. I
never want to misstep and say something that's not true, but that's
especially the case when we're talking about experimental therapies
and drugs, which formerly were taken as drugs of abuse, which are now
being used as drugs for therapeutic treatment in the clinic. There is
a very interesting study. This was published in science in 2019. So
these are very recent studies. The last author on this is Liston, L-I-
S-T-O-N. The title of the paper is "Sustained Rescue of Prefrontal
Circuit Dysfunction "by Antidepressant Induced Spine Formation." And
here, when we hear spine, we're not referring to spine as in your
vertebrae, running down your spinal column, we're talking about the
spines, which are these little protrusions on neurons. Neurons are not
smooth by any stretch. If you zoom in on a neuron, if you were to come
to my lab and look down the microscope at a neuron and zoom in on it,
you'd find that some neurons are smooth, but most neurons have these
little protrusions. And those little protrusions are called spines.
And those little spiny protrusions are little sites where neurons can
reach out and form and receive new synapses from neighboring neurons.
So they increase the surface area of a neuron and allow new
connections to be formed. And so spine formation is synonymous with
neuroplasticity, which is synonymous with changes in circuit function,
which is synonymous with changes in the ways that we think, we feel,
and we behave. And what was shown in the study is really interesting.
What they showed is that ketamine can relieve depressive symptoms
rapidly by changing or increasing in this case, the spines on these
neurons in the prefrontal cortex. And if that word prefrontal rings a
bell, well, now you remember the phosphocreatine system, the ingestion
of creatine monohydrate, and the forebrain, activation of the
forebrain were related to, in some way or another, to relief or
improvement of major depressive symptoms. So we're starting to
converge on a picture here whereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP, used in
a therapeutic context, may be increasing neuroplasticity. Literally
the changing of neurocircuits in the forebrain somehow through
dissociative states. And I don't want to speculate too much about how
that might come about, but one of the things that's such a resounding
or repeating theme of major depression is that when you talk to
somebody who has major depression, it is a real downer. And I'm not
being disparaging of those people. But if you've ever had a
conversation with someone who's depressed, they're always talking
about how exhausted they are, or in really severe cases, they are not
even responsive at all. They just kind of stare at you blankly, or
they fall asleep. I mean, they're truly depressed. Their system is
lowered in terms of its activation state. So I think that it's
interesting that the application of drugs that allow people to
separate from that state of not caring or being uninterested or
unwilling to do anything is actually one of the paths to treatment.
It's not always about just getting people peppy and excited and happy.
There also seems to be requirement for getting them distanced from
their own grief. And this brings us back to something that we talked
about way back at the beginning of this episode, which was this
particular feature of the anti self confabulation, that everything
that happens is a reflection that I should say for the depressed
person, that everything that happens is a reflection of how life is
bad and their experiences just point to the fact that nothing is going
to get better. This is the common language of depression. If this is
very depressing to hear me talk about it, it is heavy. And that's what
it's like to hear these things, it's even heavier, of course, for
somebody to experience them. And those beliefs, those patterns of
guilt and grief and anhedonia and delusional anti self confabulation,
those are the things that eventually, if they get severe enough, start
to convert into things like self harm mutilation, and in the most
tragic of cases, of course, suicide. And so I think we can look to
these treatments such as ketamine and PCP, but in particular ketamine
and its use in the clinic, as ways for people to get distanced from
the negative affect that they feel isn't just inside them or
overwhelms them, but that for the very severely depressed person, they
feel is them. And we hear this sometimes, you are not your emotions.
That's a statement that I've always been a little bit challenged by. I
mean, yes, indeed emotions are not who we are. They are states that we
go into and out of, including happiness and sadness, but they are very
much a part of us when we experience them. We don't experience them as
next to us or behind us or across the room from us. We experienced
them as our emotions. They are so much part and parcel with our
experience of ourself that a statement like we aren't our emotions is
a very hard statement to digest, especially for the depressed person.
And so I think that the NMDA receptor and its capacity to induce
neuroplasticity, circuit changes, the fact that PCP and ketamine are
both showing activation of neural circuits by way of suppressing
activity of the NMDA receptor, and some of the positive or exciting
therapeutic outcomes that are coming from this really point to the
fact that ketamine and PCP and removal of negative experiences or the
experience of a negative experience, sort of getting meta there. But
the experience of a negative experience may be an important path by
which people treat their depression, especially in its most severe
forms where people are veering towards self-harm, mutilation, and
suicide. So you may have noticed a theme, which is that certain
categories of approaches that we've been discussing for offsetting the
symptoms of depression, such as exercise, ingesting EPAs, reducing
inflammation, or even the SSRIs for increasing serotonin, focus on
changing some core biological function, like raising the amount of a
chemical, serotonin, or reducing the amount of inflammatory cytokines
in the brain and body.</p>

<p>And yet things like ketamine focus more on rewiring circuitry,
changing neural circuitry so that it functions better in the immediate
and hopefully in the long-term as well, and keep people with major
depression in what they call, remission, away from major depression.
Another category of treatments that's being actively explored now in
laboratories and in the psychiatry realm are the psychedelics. And
that's a huge category of compounds. However, one in particular,
psilocybin is one that's being most intensely and actively pursued for
its capacity to treat major depressive disorder. I want to be very
clear that the work that I'm going to describe as work that's being
done in university settings, university hospitals, by scientists and
psychiatrists, and these are clinical studies, clinical trials,
leading to peer reviewed data. And those are the data that we'll be
discussing. Some of the major luminaries in this area include, of
course aren't limited to, but include people like Matthew Johnson
who's at Johns Hopkins. We'll discuss some of his work now, and
fortunate to say that he will be coming on the podcast as a guest to
just scribe the studies in a variety of laboratories, working on a
variety of different psychedelic compounds, but let's focus on
psilocybin for its capacity to rewire neural circuits and alleviate
depression. There have been anecdotal data or evidence over the years
that psilocybin has this capacity, how does psilocybin work? Well,
psilocybin, magic mushrooms, as it's sometimes called, mainly works on
what's called the serotonin 5H2A receptor with some affinity for the
5HT1 receptor. What does that mean? Well, basically, you've got a lot
of different kinds of serotonin receptors just as you have a lot of
different kinds of dopamine receptors or other types of receptors. The
advantage of having different receptors expressed in different parts
of the brain and body, even on different parts of individual cells in
the brain and body is that the same compound, serotonin, can have a
diverse set of effects on different cells and tissues. This is also
the basis of some of the side effect profiles of SSRIs, because maybe
for instance, we know that taking Prozac fluoxetine will increase
serotonin in one area, but also in another area. And then they will go
have diverse effects on different brain circuits because of the
variety of receptors. Receptors are just like parking slots where the
molecule serotonin parks and has different effects. Well psilocybin
engages or increases serotonin transmission, meaning it increases the
amount of serotonin, mainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors, but
where in the brain does it happen and what are the major effects?
First, let's talk about the major effects 'cause I think that's what
people are interested in. The study that I'd like to highlight is a
fairly recent one. It was published in may of 2021 in Journal of the
American Medical Association Psychiatry, so JAMA Psychiatry, and it's
entitled, "Effects of Psilocybin Assisted Therapy "on Major Depressive
Disorder, a Randomized Clinical Trial." It's an absolutely beautiful
study, a very important study. It includes some of the luminaries in
this area like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan, Roland Griffiths, and
others. We will provide a link to this study. It is available in its
full form at zero cost if you want to read it. It's got a lot of
detail. So I'm just going to summarize a few things, but basically
what they did was they screened for patients to come into the clinic.
These were people that suffered from major depressive disorder, and
administered either one or two rounds of psilocybin. They used
particular dosages that are listed in the study. So you can look it up
if you're really interested in that level of detail. Typically it was
20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. So it depends on body
weight. Or 30 milligrams of psilocybin per 70 kilograms of body
weight. They were given in capsule form. So people weren't eating the
mushrooms. This is obviously a very controlled study and they wanted
to control the dosages appropriately. They were randomized to begin
the treatment immediately or after an eight week delay. They had all
the appropriate control groups that one would like to see. What's
really striking this study is that there was a very significant
improvement in mood and affect and relief from depressive symptoms in
anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people that were subjects in the study
who received the psilocybin treatment. And whether or not it was 50 or
whether or not it was 71%, varied according to how long after the
study they maintain these antidepressive effects, whether or not they
stayed in remission from the depression, but these are really enormous
insignificant effects, and very exciting and are pointing in the
direction of psilocybin very soon, becoming a treatment for various
forms of depression, including major depression. Now, of course, this
is limited to the laboratory at present. There are a number of
elements of these studies that are important to take into
consideration too, which is that there are highly trained guides,
meaning people to direct people through the experience. As Matthew
Johnson has told me, there is the occurrence from time to time of
people having so-called bad trips of having anxiety attacks during the
hallucinations and all that. And they have ways to mitigate that and
deal with that because the guides are trained. They have all the sorts
of medical monitoring devices for heart rate and temperature and
things that one would like to see for a study like this, because these
are very powerful compounds. I don't want to give away any elements of
the discussion with Matthew Johnson, because it will be released in
podcast form reasonably soon here, the Huberman Lab podcast. But one
of the things that came up and is a fundamental question that I had,
that I think probably many of you are asking, is does the experience
that one has on these compounds make a difference for whether or not
somebody gains relief from depression, from these psilocybin journeys
or not? In other words, does it matter what they talk about? Does it
matter what they think about? Does it matter if they have a good trip
or a bad trip? And I don't want to hold you in too much suspense, I'll
let Matthew provide the more thorough answer. But what's really
interesting is there are some common themes to psilocybin
administration and experience that lead to relief from depressive
symptoms, but they are subjectively very varied, meaning that whether
or not people feel they had a good experience or a bad experience,
whether or not people thought about their parents or thought about the
color of the ceiling, doesn't seem to have too much of an impact on
whether or not they receive relief during these studies in these
clinical studies. It seems like different people can have lots of
different experiences and still receive benefit. And that points to
something deeper. It points to the fact that these drugs, which is
really what they are, are rewiring neural circuitry in a common way
despite a diversity of experience while on the drug. And that itself
is really interesting. And it takes us back to a place that we've been
before in this discussion, which is layer five of the cortex. This
area that ketamine seems to impact as well by generating rhythms of
the, I mentioned one to three Hertz activity in layer five of certain
areas of the cortex. Well, the 5HT1A receptor is known to be enriched
in layer five of the cortex, and layer five of the cortex is a very
interesting area because it's an area in which there's a lot of
lateral connectivity. So connections between different brain areas
laterally, generally is what allows us to merge different senses. So
for instance, when we hear a sound off to our right over here, we turn
to our right. There's a very hardwired response. And typically we hear
something off to our right, we don't look to our left. That's how
hardwired some of these circuits are. What appears to be happening is
that the activation of the serotonin system and 5HT1A receptor in
layer five is offering up or providing an experience whereby the
lateral connections are able to engage much more broadly than they
would normally. Now that also could be a bad thing. And I asked Matt
about this, that sounds kind of spooky. I don't know that when I hear
something off to my right, that I want to look off to my left. That
could be highly maladaptive, especially if it's a car coming at me
from my right. That doesn't seem to be what's happening. It's not
really rewiring these deeply reflexive circuits. It's somehow rewiring
associations between events, emotional events, past events, current
events, and future events in ways that allow people to get some sort
of relief or distance from these narratives, these depressive stories
about their past and present and allow them to see new opportunity and
optimism in the future. It's really a fascinating thing if you really
think about it, because I would have thought that simply by ramping up
laterality of connections, meaning that cross associations, that
things could either be rewired randomly in ways that don't serve us,
or would perhaps just cause no effect at all. So it's either going to
be bad or neutral, but that's not really the way things are turning
out. Again, these are highly controlled studies. I do want to
emphasize that ketamine, psilocybin, these things are still illegal.
Most all places. There are some regions and cities in the United
States where they are locally decriminalized, but they are not legal.
They're still illegal. So what we're referring to here are indeed
clinical studies in which people are taking them legally. I think it's
very likely we will see a shift in the legislature around
psychedelics, and in particular, psilocybin in the not too distant
future. And I think that for now, what we should know is what Matt
told me and what you'll hear far more about, which is that psilocybin.
this one where in most cases, two dose treatments done in a highly
clinical setting, controlled setting with patients that are carefully
selected, can in many cases, the majority of people receive and
maintain relief from their depressive symptoms, simply through the
experience of this psychedelic journey. I did ask them about micro
dosing. I made it sound as if I'd never heard about it before.
Microdosing, not micro dosing. Microdosing, and his answer was
interesting. His answer was that the microdosing effects don't seem to
be nearly as impactful as some of these, well, let's just call them
what they are. These kind of high amplitude sessions that there are
just one or two, there are some studies ongoing where there's more
than two, but that the microdosing doesn't seem to compare to these
macrodosing, I mentioned the dosages before, this 20 milligrams per 70
kilograms or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms dosages given several
weeks apart. So you'll hear more about microdosing and other
psychedelics and their impact on depressive states and major
depression in the episode with Matt. But for the time being, it really
seems as if, again, we're looking at neuroplasticity, we're coming
back to layer five, just like with ketamine and PCP. We're hearing
about layer five, we're hearing about rewiring of circuitry, we're
hearing about a dissociation or a distancing of oneself from these
negative moods and affects and narratives, but there's a key
distinction between the ketamine work and the psilocybin work, which
is that in the ketamine work, it really is about dissociating from
experience during the session with the psychiatrist, whereas during
the psilocybin journey, it's really about immersing oneself in the
experience and being fully present to that experience. That does seem
to be an important component and what the difference is there and why
they both seem to provide some relief from major depression isn't
clear. I think most likely it takes us back to the fact that this
thing we call major depression clearly involves serotonin, dopamine,
and norepinephrine. And in some individuals, they may be more
deficient in one or several of those or all of those, whereas in other
individuals, it might be a different collection of chemicals. And of
course there are a tremendous number of other psychedelic compounds
that people are exploring for treatment of major depression. But
really psilocybin is the one that we have the most data on. MDMA has
mainly been explored in the clinical realm for treatment of trauma.
There are some trials ongoing for treatment of depression, but the big
breakthrough seemed to be happening in the realm of trauma treatment,
the so-called maps group that's doing this, again, legally in a
clinical setting. And there are other groups that are starting to do
it as well. We are going to do an entire podcast about MDMA and some
related compounds. So I'll save that discussion for then. One of the
most common questions I get for this podcast is about different diets,
different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto,
ketogenic diet, or vegan diets, or intermittent fasting, or the all
meat diet, the so-called lion diet, et cetera.</p>
<h1 id="protocol-8-ketogenic-diet-gaba-gamma-aminobutyric-acid"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=6420">Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)</a></h1>
<p>There are actually really interesting data relating nutrition and diet
to major depressive disorder. And I think we just need to frame this
by returning to something that was said earlier, which is that the
ingestion of carbohydrates, in particular carbohydrates and some meats
like turkey, that are rich in tryptophan, this precursor to serotonin,
are in many ways the self-medicating version of depression treatment.
Now, to be clear, I'm not saying that people should use food to
medicate their depression. Many people do that reflexively however,
they reach for carbohydrate rich foods to blunt their cortisol,
because that's indeed what it does. It blunts cortisol when you ingest
high carbohydrate foods, in particular starchy foods, and it does
increase serotonin, in particular, if those foods rather are rich in
the amino acid tryptophan. Now ingesting food is wonderful and
important and great, but ingesting excessive foods of any kinds,
carbohydrate or otherwise it's not healthy, of course. There have been
some explorations of whether or not a vegan diet can improve symptoms
of depression. Not a lot of data, not impressive data. There have been
very few controlled studies looking at the carnivore or all meat diet.
On that, I think there are now some that are starting to spin up,
meaning those studies are starting to spin up. However, the ketogenic
diet has been explored for its ability to relieve certain symptoms of
depression, in particular to what's called maintain euthymia. Euthymia
is the kind of state of equilibrium between a manic episode and a
depressive episode in a manic bipolar person. We'll return to this
more in a future episode, but it basically, maniacs have highs and
they have lows, bipolars, either cycle back and forth really quickly.
So rapid cycling bipolars or slow, some people So really quickly can
be day to day, other people it's month to month or week to week,
they're going highs and lows. And you hear about mania and you hear
about dysphoria, euthymia is that kind of place in the middle where
people feel neither too high nor too low. And there are some
interesting studies looking at the ketogenic diet for maintaining
euthymia in manic depressives, but also in people with major
depressive disorder. Why would this work? Well, we have to remember
that the ketogenic diet wasn't discovered so that self appointed
nutrition gurus could talk about it online or so that people could
make money selling anything related to ketosis. And here I'm not
disparaging of the ketogenic diet. It's helped a lot of people. The
ketogenic diet was actually shown to be medically relevant for its use
to treat epilepsy. It turns out that in epilepsy, or in particular
pediatric epilepsy, that a ketogenic diet and the shift of brain
metabolism to predominantly one in which ketones are being metabolized
rather than more standard glucose tight metabolism, can greatly reduce
the number of epileptic seizures that these children experience. It's
not always the case, but it's often the case. And so you talk to a
neurologist or a neurosurgeon who's specialized in epilepsy, in
particular pediatric epilepsy, and they'll tell you this, "Oh yeah,
the ketogenic diet, in many cases, not all, "can be very effective for
this treatment." How? How is it that a ketogenic diet reduces
seizures? Well, the way it reduces seizures is by increasing what's
called GABA transmission. GABA is a substance that is naturally
released in our brain. It's an inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning
that when it's released into the synapse, it has the tendency to
reduce the firing, to reduce the electrical activity of the next
neuron or sets of neurons. There are various compounds that increase
GABA, in particular, GABA in the forebrain. One common example would
be something like alcohol, drinking alcoholic drink or two will
increase GABA transmission, ironically will lower your social
inhibitions by increasing your neurochemical inhibition. It basically
suppresses the self-monitoring pathways. And if people drink enough,
it will suppress all pathways and people will urinate themselves and
fall over. It will eventually inhibit all sorts of pathways. So the
GABA system has a rich array of effects all over the brain and body.
But alcohol tends to activate the release of GABA. You might say, well
then why not just take alcohol to suppress seizures? Well, that be a
terrible idea because there tends to be a rebound excitability after
alcohol stops having its effects on the GABA receptors. And so then
there's an excitability for which an epilepsy would be terrible. The
reason why the epileptic diet is useful for epilepsy is that increases
what we call the tonic level, the sort of the ti, the level of GABA in
the brain, and that suppresses some of the hyperexcitability, that is
the characteristic feature of epilepsy. And there are other drugs, for
instance, the benzodiazepines and things of the Xanax, variety,
Valium, and so forth. Those increased GABA transmission. Those drugs
also have a lot of potential for abuse and addiction, et cetera, and
they're problematic for other reasons. But the ketogenic diet, by way
of increasing ketone metabolism or shifting brain's metabolism over to
ketones tends to modulate GABA such that GABA is more active and
adjust the so-called GABA glutamate balance. This is getting
technical, but glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, GABA is
inhibitory neurotransmitter, and their balance is vital for
neuroplasticity, for maintaining healthy levels of activity in the
brain, et cetera. And so there is decent evidence that people with
major depressive disorders, in particular, the people with major
depressive disorders that are refractory, meaning they don't respond
to classical antidepressants, can benefit, it seems, from the
ketogenic diet. Now this is not always the case, but for those of you
out there who are struggling with major depression, and for which
drugs have not worked, please talk to your psychiatrist. I don't know
how many of them are up on the literature about the ketogenic diet or
the EPAs and the rest. Psychiatrists vary in terms of how involved in
the current literature they tend to be, but there are many excellent
psychiatrists out there. Most of them in my experience, are actually
quite avid learners about what's happening and what's new in this
realm that they call psychiatry. So it's really interesting that
eating in a particular way, lowering carbohydrates to the point where
you rely on ketogenic metabolism in the brain, increases GABA and can
provide some relief for depressive symptoms. And that in particular,
that seems to have positive effects in people that are refractory or
don't respond to classic antidepressants. And that would include
things like fluoxetine, et cetera. I'll make one final point about
ketogenic diets and GABA and depression, which is that it's also been
shown that for people that respond well to these drugs that impact the
serotonin system, dopamine system, or norepinephrine, the ketogenic
diet, there may improve the ability for those drugs to work at lower
dosages, which is reminiscent of what we saw with the EPA
supplementation. So today we've covered what at least feels to me,
like a tremendous amount of material.</p>
<h1 id="summary-of-protocols-covered"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&amp;t=6890">Summary of Protocols Covered</a></h1>
<p>This topic of depression is indeed an enormous topic to try and get
our arms around. We talked about the symptomology, we talked about
some of the underlying neurochemistry and biology, and then we talked
about approaches to deal with it that are really grounded in the
neurochemistry in biology. I just want to recap a few of those tools
and what those things are. First of all, we talked about making the
effort to not overwhelm the pleasure system. That might seem
counterintuitive. To not overly seek out pleasure, or else one can
find themselves in a place of depression. I mentioned way back at the
beginning of the episode, a young man who I know to be really
struggling with depression, and it is thought, and we don't know for
sure, but is thought that some of that depression was probably
triggered by an overindulgence in video games and other highly
dopaminergic activities to the point where those activities eventually
were countered by the pain balance that Dr. Anna Lembke described. And
he now has to do those activities repeatedly and for many, many hours
each day, just to feel okay, not even to derive pleasure from them.
And worse, many other activities, practically all other activities
have lost their zest, they've lost their excitement and his sense of
pleasure for them. And so there's a really active campaign now to
reset that system. So, number one, don't overwhelm your pleasure
centers either through activities or compounds. Might seem
counterintuitive, but you're setting yourself up for anhedonia and
depression if you do that. It's not just about addiction that too, but
it's also about setting yourself for anhedonia and depression. How
often can you engage in these activities? Well, that's going to differ
from person to person, everyone's slightly different, but you should
really mind your extreme highs and your extreme lows and be cautious
about those. We'll probably have a Dr. Lembke on again at a future
time to try and get some more specifics about that. But if you do feel
like you need to reset that system, it really does seem like a 30 day
complete detox from whatever activity or substance that is. And
ideally it doesn't continue after that 30 days, especially in
conditions of drugs of abuse. Second of all, talks about the
norepinephrine system and how the norepinephrine system is really
deficient in many forms of major depression. And in depression, there
is now more deliberate pursuit of nor epinephrin inducing activities
that are healthy, that aren't adrenaline seeking per se, things like
cold showers, things like particular patterns of breathing that engage
and tend to make us more alert, things like exercise that will
increase our levels of noradrenaline. I'd be remiss if I said that
these activities could completely eliminate depressive symptoms in
people with major depressive disorder. I don't think that's the case.
And again, I want to acknowledge that people with major depressive
symptoms often don't have the energy, the willingness, or the capacity
to engage in some of these activities, but things like cold shower,
deliberate cold showers, things like regular exercise, they aren't
just feel good activities. They actually engage the norepinephrine
system and keep that system tuned up and allow us to increase our
norepinephrine levels at will on a regular basis. And their mood
enhancing effects are real effects at the level of neurochemistry,
then we talked about EPAs, Essential Fatty Acids, and it's clear that
for most people, getting above 1000 milligrams and probably even
closer to 2000 milligrams per day of EPAs can be beneficial for mood,
especially in attempts to treat or offset major depressive disorder.
Are there side effects? Well, you need to explore those for yourself
and with your doctor, everyone has a different health background. For
the margins of safety, for most people would probably be quite large,
but for some people that might not be the case. So definitely check
with your physician. We also talked about exercise and how EPA and
exercise on a regular basis can offset these inflammatory pathways. I
want to mention something I've mentioned on a previous podcast, but in
terms of keeping the Inflammatone, all these molecules that create
inflammation, and then the inflammation can limit the amount of
serotonin through the pathways we described. In order to do that, it's
also very, very useful to ingest two to four servings of fermented
foods on a daily basis or near daily basis. These are data that were
published by the Sonnenberg Lab at Stanford recently in the journal
Cell, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal that ingestion of these
fermented foods really keeps the gut microbiome tuned up, so to speak,
well in order to offset these inflammatory cytokines, keeping
inflammation at bay, it just turns out to be a really good thing in
order to keep our mood in a good place. So EPA, exercise, fermented
foods, creatine as a potential source of relief from depression or
offsetting, or keeping us away from major depression or relapse into
depression. And then we talked about the prescription compounds and
the compounds that are being used mainly in the course of studies and
of psychiatry and depression, things like ketamine, PCP, psilocybin,
and related compounds. And then lastly, we talked about ketosis, which
may not be right for everybody, but might be right for certain
individuals out there who are grappling with this.</p>

T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman. There, you can see the supplements I take.
If you want to try any of those supplements, you get 20% off any of
those supplements. And if you navigate from that location in the
website to any other locations in the Thorne site, you will also get
20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes. We partnered
with Thorne because they have the absolutely highest levels of
stringency in terms of the quality and quantity of the supplements
that they put in their formulations. And last but not least, I want to
thank you for embarking on this journey of trying to understand what
is depression, how does it work, and how to treat it. And thank you
for your interest in science. [upbeat music]</p>
