</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This episode I discuss endurance: our ability to perform effort over
extended amounts of time. I describe the four kinds of endurance:
muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two
kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency
of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I
review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles
properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the
visual physiological basis of the "extra gear" we all can leverage for
effort. Finally, I review how accelerating as we fatigue can allow us
to access untapped energetic resources.</p>

<h1 id="introduction"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=0">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>welcome to the hubermann lab podcast where we discuss science and
science-based tools for everyday life  i'm andrew huberman and i'm a
professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at stanford school of
medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles
at stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information about science and science related tools
to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is roca rocco makes
sunglasses and eyeglasses and i'm delighted that they're a partner and
a sponsor for the podcast as some of you may already know i've spent
two decades or more studying the visual system how we see vision is
absolutely the most important sense by which humans navigate the world
and survive and our eyes as two pieces of our brain do many other
important things as well so taking good care of our eyesight is
essential founded by two all-american swimmers from stamford roca was
born out of an obsession for performance they carefully put science
and purpose behind their design choices and they built absolutely
terrific products as a result the glasses are amazing i love them
because they look great they are super comfortable and the optical
clarity is incredible they filter out sunlight in a way that still
allows you to see contrast and shadows the way you need to you know
for me one of the things that's really irritating is if i have a pair
of sunglasses that don't allow me to see all the things i want to see
and with roka glasses i get incredible contrast but then i can also
relax and be outdoors in bright light and as the amount of light
changes with cloud cover and things of that sort my ability to see my
surroundings is still really sharp and really clear and that only
comes from really understanding how the visual system works and how it
adjusts to contrast and adaptation and all these different things they
really understand the science and that went into the design of these
glasses and as many of you know sunlight and the viewing of light is
also very important for setting circadian rhythms so that's also been
incorporated into the design and science behind these glasses i do
wear readers i don't often wear them during the podcast but i have to
wear reading glasses at night so i use their readers and i own a pair
of their sunglasses and i'm delighted with them if you'd like to check
out roka glasses you can go to roca.com that's roka.com and enter the
code huberman to save 20 off your first order that's roka.com enter
the code huberman at checkout to get 20 off your first order today's
podcast is also brought to you by inside tracker inside tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and
dna to help you better understand your body and reach your health
goals i'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the
simple reason that many of the important things that are vital to our
immediate and long-term health can only be detected in a good quality
blood test the problem with blood tests is that most blood tests you
get a lot of information back about levels that are too high or too
low of this thing or the other thing but making sense of that and what
to do with that information is very challenging even if you have a
really attentive physician oftentimes it's mysterious as to what to do
with all this data with inside tracker they make it very easy to
understand what all the metabolic factors hormone factors etc mean for
you and what to do about those markers so they offer you directives in
terms of nutrition supplementation as well as lifestyle factors like
exercise sleep etc that can allow you to take control of those numbers
and bring them into the ranges that are best for you and your long-
term health another feature of inside tracker that's great is their
inner age test this test shows you what your biological age and how it
compares to your chronological age which i can only imagine most
everybody including me are extremely interested in how long am i
likely to live how old am i really in terms of my biology if you'd
like to try inside tracker you can visit insidetracker.com huberman to
get 25 off any of inside tracker's plans use the code huberman at
checkout today's episode is also brought to us by athletic greens
athletic greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink i've
been using athletic green since 2012 and so i'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast with athletic greens you get a ton of factors
that are good for you mixed into this one really good tasting drink i
like to mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice and i
drink that once or twice a day typically once early in the day and
sometimes also in the afternoon or even evening i'm able to sleep
after drinking in the evening just fine the reason i've been using
athletic greens for so long that i continue to use athletic greens is
that one i feel better when i take it i just do psychologically
physically i feel better but also it covers all my bases of the things
that i need for my general health sort of a foundational supplement as
i like to call it in fact when people ask me what should i take if i
were to recommend just one supplement that people take it would be
athletic greens with athletic greens you get support for your gut
which is important because the gut microbiome is important for the gut
brain access for mood metabolism hormones etc there are so many data
that support that statement as well there are many factors in athletic
greens that support general health metabolism endocrine factors
immunity etc so with athletic greens i drink it once or twice a day
and i know that i've got all that covered if you'd like to try
athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and if you
do that you can claim a special offer they'll send you five free
travel packs plus a year surpr supply excuse me of vitamin d3 and k2
so you get the 5 free travel packs and a year supply of d3 if you go
to athleticgreens.com</p>
<h1 id="why-everyone-should-train-endurance"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=345">Why Everyone Should Train Endurance</a></h1>
<p>huberman you can claim that special offer for the last month four
episodes to be exact we've been discussing physical performance and
skill learning we've talked about how to learn skills faster whether
or not those are skills for athletic performance dance music things of
that sort we've also talked about how to gain strength and how to lose
fat faster by leveraging the nervous system things like shiver and
non-shiver non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis we talked about
how neurons can actually trigger accelerated fat loss we talked about
hypertrophy also called muscle growth and we covered everything from
sets and reps protocols how long to stay in a cold ice bath when to
get out how to keep shivering we've covered a lot of tools and a lot
of science so if you're interested in those things and you even
perhaps want to learn a little bit about how we make energy atp from
carbohydrates or from fats it's all covered in the previous four
episodes this was going to be the time that we moved to a new topic
entirely but we are going to do one more episode in this series on
physical performance for the simple reason that you asked many
questions about something that's vitally important both for physical
performance and long-term and short-term health and that's endurance
and so today we are going to talk about endurance now if you're a
strength athlete or you're not interested in endurance don't depart
just yet because it turns out that there are ways to train endurance
that are very different than i would have previously imagined if you
only think about long runs long swims marathons half marathons 10ks
5ks and that sort of thing puts you to sleep kind of like costello is
snoring in the background right now he's not a long distance endurance
athlete that's for sure if you're interested in those things or if you
are averse to those things i encourage you to continue listening
because we are going to talk about a little bit of science and then
some specific protocols that really define what endurance is the four
types of endurance and ways to train those in concert with the other
things that you might be doing like weight training or skill training
or yoga and if you are an endurance athlete we are going to cover a
lot of tools and science that i'm certain will also help enhance your
training and performance in races or even just recreationally the
topic of endurance i think has been badly misrepresented frankly
online and when you start digging into the science and you start
talking to real experts in this area what you discover what i've
discovered is that it's an incredibly interesting area because it
teaches us so much about how our body and our brain use fuels and how
we can control which fuels are used by our body and brain so today we
will talk about the four kinds of endurance we will also cover the
topic of hydration which might sound incredibly boring like okay just
drink more water but it's really interesting because not only is
hydration a limiting factor on performance but there is a right way to
hydrate and there is a wrong way to hydrate there actually is a
formula that i'll teach you to know how much water to be drinking
depending on your activity levels and if that sounds like a simple
thing like oh just you know tap off water until your urine runs clear
that's actually the wrong advice it turns out that if you don't
hydrate properly you can see 20 to 30 percent reductions in
performance whether or not that strength whether that's increasing
hypertrophy whether or not that's running swimming even mental
performance so even if you're not an athlete or a recreational athlete
at all i encourage you to stay tuned for the part about hydration so
we're going to cover as usual a little bit of science and then we're
going to dive right into protocols that you can apply if you like and
if you deem those correct and safe</p>
<h1 id="all-episodes-now-searchable-at-hubermanlabcom-the-neural-network"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=589">All Episodes Now Searchable at hubermanlab.com &amp; The Neural Network</a></h1>
<p>for you before we dive into all that i want to make an important
announcement which is all the episodes of the hubermann lab podcast
are now housed on a single website which is hubermanlab.com if you go
to hubermannlab.com you can find all the episodes in youtube apple and
spotify format with links there the website is also searchable so if
you go into the little search function which you'll find very easily
and you put in for instance creatine or sleep or ice bath or sauna it
will take you to the specific episodes that contain that information
and in addition if you go to the website hubermanlab.com you have the
opportunity to sign up for what we call the hubermann lab neural
network the hubermann lab neural network is a zero cost resource where
once a month perhaps more often you'll receive a email newsletter and
that newsletter will contain specific protocols announcements
attachments of pdfs and things of that sort of protocols tools and
science from the podcast we will also make any announcements about
live lectures which at some point i'll probably start doing in various
cities in the us and probably around the world as well as well as
other things that i think would be really useful to you all of course
at zero cost so that's hubermanlab.com sign up for the neural network
newsletter you can find that in the menu tab or it might pop up when
you get there and i hope you will join and as a final announcement if
you're not already following us on instagram you can go to huberman
lab on instagram and if you do that i often make announcements and
release protocols and links to protocols and things there</p>
<h1 id="how-to-maintain-muscle"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=688">How To Maintain Muscle</a></h1>
<p>as well i briefly want to touch on something from the previous episode
which is that if you are somebody that is trying to increase muscle
strength and or size or if you're simply somebody who doesn't want to
increase muscle strength and size you just want to maintain the
musculature that you have it's vital that you perform at least five
sets of resistance training per muscle per week if we don't do that we
lose muscle over time and that is one reason among many to have a
regular resistance training protocol nobody wants to start resembling
a folded over envelope or a melted candle no one wants to have
challenges getting up out of a chair or off the ground maintaining
musculature is vital not just to our immediate health but to our long-
term health trajectory so i just want to emphasize that point if
you're curious about the sets the reps how close to failure to go or
not go whether or not you should be doing your cardiovascular training
before or after your weight training all of that is in the previous
episode right down to the details and i like to think made simple for
you to understand but i do strongly believe that resistance training
whether or not it's with body weight or bands or weights or simply
lifting rocks in the yard or logs in the yard is vital for our
systemic physiology and our overall health and that includes our brain
health and i described the reasons for that and</p>
<h1 id="endurance-its-not-what-you-think-crossover-with-brain-function"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=776">Endurance: It’s Not What You Think, Crossover With Brain Function</a></h1>
<p>the mechanisms in the previous episode today i'd like to talk about
endurance and how to build endurance and how to use endurance for the
health of your entire body endurance as the name suggests is our
ability to engage in continuous bouts of exercise or continuous
movement or continuous effort of any kind and i do believe that our
ability to engage in activities that we call endurance training or
physical endurance activities do have carryover to mental performance
of things that require long-term effort i'll touch on that at the end
and why there's reason to believe that there's a biological crossover
between those two things i don't think it's simply the case that if
you train yourself to be a strength and speed athlete and to do short
bouts of exercise that are very intense that you can only do mental
work that's of short bouts and very intense but it is clear that
cardiovascular exercise exercise where you're getting your heart rate
up continuously for a period of time and endurance exercise we will
define what that is in a moment is vital for tapping into and
enhancing various aspects of our biology in the body and in the brain
such that our brain can perform work for longer periods of time
focused work learning etc so i want to dive into the topic of
endurance and i want to just begin by addressing something that's
vital to any kind of effort whether or not it's mental effort or
physical effort so as always a little bit of science and we'll get
right into</p>
<h1 id="energy-many-paths-to-atp-creatine-glucose-glycogen-fat-ketones"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=878">Energy; Many Paths To ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones</a></h1>
<p>protocols so the key thing to understand about energy production in
the body meaning your ability to think your ability to talk your
ability to walk your ability to run is this thing that we call atp atp
and mitochondria which are just little what we call organelles within
cells these are little factories that make energy if you will atp is
required for anything that requires energy for anything that you do
that requires effort and there are different ways to get atp and we
have been gifted as a species with the ability to convert lots of
things into atp we can convert carbohydrates literally the kinds of
carbohydrates you eat a bagel you eat a piece of pizza pizza usually
is dough and it has cheese and some other things costello here as we
talk about pizza custard loves pizza by the way eating a piece of
pizza it gets converted into various things fatty acids from the fats
glucose from the bread and those things get converted into atp within
cells through things like glycolysis things like lipolysis i talked
about this in previous episodes so our muscles and our neurons use
different fuel sources to generate atp the ones that are used first
for short bouts of intense activity are things like phosphocreatine if
you've only heard about creatine as a supplement well phosphocreatine
actually exists in our muscles and that's why people take creatine you
can load your muscles with more creatine and though and excuse me
phosphate creatine is great for short intense bouts of effort so when
you're really pushing hard on something physical let's say you see a
car on the side of the road and that car is stalled and a person says
hey can you help me push my car and you start to push that's gonna be
phosphocreatine it's gonna be your main fuel source then you start to
tap into things like glucose which is literally just carbohydrate it's
just sugar that's in your blood and then if you keep pushing on that
car you keep in engaging in a particular effort or you keep studying
or you keep listening to this podcast you start to tap into other fuel
sources like glycogen from your liver which is just it's like a little
pack just like you know you might have packed a sandwich or something
for work you have a little pack of glycogen in your liver that you can
rely on and you have fat stored in adipose tissue even if you have
very very low body fat percentage like you're one of these people as
like three percent or five percent body fat really thin skin very
little body fat you can extract lipids fatty acids from that body fat
it's like a storage pack it is a storage pack for energy that can be
converted to atp so without going into any more detail when i say
today energy or i say atp just remember that regardless of your diet
regardless of your nutritional plan your body has the capacity to use
creatine glucose glycogen lipids and if you're ketogenic ketones we'll
talk about ketosis in order to generate fuel energy now the other
crucial point is that in</p>
<h1 id="the-vital-need-for-oxygen-but-why"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=1080">The Vital Need For Oxygen: But Why?</a></h1>
<p>order to complete that process of taking these fuels and converting
them into energy most of the time you need oxygen you need air
basically in your system now it's not actual air you need oxygen
molecules in your system comes in through your mouth and your nose
goes to your lungs and distributes via the bloodstream oxygen is not a
fuel but like a fire that has no oxygen you can't actually burn the
logs but when you blow a lot of oxygen onto a fire basically onto a
logs with a flame there then basically it will take five it will take
fire it will burn okay oxygen allows you to burn fuel so today we are
going to ask the critical questions what allows us to perform what
allows us to continue effort for long periods of time and that effort
could be a run it could be a swim</p>
<h1 id="what-allows-us-to-endure-anything"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=1140">What Allows Us To Endure (Anything)?</a></h1>
<p>it could be studying it could be anything that extends over a long
period of time well you're going to need energy and you're going to
need oxygen but the way to answer a question like what allows us to
endure right endurance what allows us to keep going well we think of
things like willpower but what's willpower willpower is neurons it's
neurons in our brain we have this thing called the central governor
which decides whether or not we should or could continue or whether or
not we should stop whether or not we should quit okay so whether or
not you're somebody who has a lot of what we would call resilience and
endurance or whether or not you're somebody who taps out early and
quits early or can't handle frustration that has to do with your fuel
utilization in specific neurons so we have to ask the question what is
the limiting factor on performance right so instead of saying what
allows us to endure we should say what prevents us from enduring what
prevents us from moving forward what are the factors that say you know
what no more i'm not going to continue this run or you know what i've
had a really long hard day or maybe i've had an easy day or i'm
feeling lazy i just don't even really feel like getting up and moving
so what we're going to talk about today actually gets right down to
the heart of motivation and fuel use motivation and fuel allocation
and we are going to talk about specific training protocols that you
can follow that have carryover between the bodily systems of running
swimming etc and the way that your brain works so let's talk about
endurance by asking first what are the limiting factors on endurance
what stops us because in addressing that and answering that we will
understand what allows us to get into effort and to</p>

<p>continue effort there are five main categories of things that allow us
to engage in effort and they are neurons nerves muscle muscle blood
things in our blood our heart and our lungs now i don't want to
completely write off things like the immune system and other systems
of the body but nerve muscle blood heart and lungs are the five that i
want to focus on today because that's where most of the data are as we
go forward into this i want to acknowledge dr andy galpin who as with
the last episode it's been tremendously helpful and informative in
terms of the exercise physiology is a true expert he has a laboratory
he's a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy who understands
the science but who also works with athletes and works with
recreational athletes professional athletes really understands at a
variety of levels how all these systems work he's the person i
consulted with about today's episode although i did access other
literature as well and i'm going to mention a key review for any of
you aficionados who really want to get down into the weeds but i
encourage you if you want more detail to check out dr andy galpin's
youtube page i think he's also on twitter he's definitely on instagram
his content is excellent and he really understands i have learned and
i really believe that an intellectual is somebody who understands a
topic at multiple levels of specificity of detail and can communicate
that and andy is a true intellectual of muscle physiology and
performance and if you hear the word intellectual and you kind of back
up and cringe from that understand that he's also a practitioner so
thank you andrew galpin andy galpin for your support in these episodes
and we hope to have you as a guest on the podcast soon so nerve muscle
blood heart and lungs let's talk about neurons and how they work okay
but i want to tell you about an</p>
<h1 id="why-you-quit-it-is-all-in-your-mind"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=1370">Why You Quit: It IS All In Your Mind</a></h1>
<p>experiment that's going to make it very clear why quitting is a mental
thing not a physical thing so why do we quit well an experiment was
done a couple years ago and was published in the journal cell cell
press journal excellent journal showing that there is a class of
neurons in our brain stem in the back of our brain that if they shut
off we quit now these neurons release epinephrine epinephrine is
adrenaline and any time we are engaged in effort of any kind we are
releasing epinephrine any time we're awake really we are releasing
epinephrine into our brain in fact this little group of neurons in the
back of our brain is called the locus ceruleus if you like is churning
out epinephrine all the time but if something stresses us out it turns
out more and then it acts as kind of an alertness signal for the whole
brain we also of course have adrenaline epinephrine released in our
body which makes our body ready for things so think about epinephrine
as a readiness signal and when we are engaged in effort this readiness
signal is being churned into our brain when we're relaxed and we're
falling asleep epinephrine levels are low okay so they did a really
interesting experiment where they had subjects engage in bouts of
effort of trying to move forward toward a goal but they manipulated
the visual environment with these stripes kind of like fences passing
on both sides of them and by doing that they could trick subjects into
thinking that their effort was either allowing them to move forward
right because these rungs on the fence were moving past or that their
effort was futile that they were no longer moving forward because they
would make the rungs move slowly even though the subjects were making
a lot of effort to move forward okay so this is analogous or similar
to being on a treadmill and you're trying to walk on this treadmill
and you just can't move the conveyor right or you're in virtual
reality and you're putting a ton of effort but it seems like you're
moving excruciatingly slow i had this experience recently in real life
i was doing a swim in the pacific i was trying to go south and i was
swimming and i was caught in a current not the kind that pulls you out
to ocean and i kept looking to my left and i saw this hotel on the
shoreline and then i was swimming and swimming and swimming and
swimming and 20 minutes later i looked to my left and the hotel is
still exactly where it was before which meant that i wasn't moving it
felt futile eventually either the current changed or something change
and i eventually swam past the hotel got back on the beach and
eventually drove home that's essentially what they did in this
experiment but what they found was these neurons that release
epinephrine there's another cell type called glia which actually means
glue in latin that is paying attention to how much epinephrine is
being released and at some point the system reaches a threshold it
reaches this threshold and it shuts off the release of more
epinephrine it's like i quit that's it no more effort signal if they
could extend the time before those glia said ah enough if they could
release more adrenaline into the system then subjects would keep going
so our desire to continue or put differently our willingness to
continue and our desire to quit is mediated by events between our two
ears now that doesn't mean that the body's not involved but it means
that neurons are critically important so we have two categories of
neurons that are important the ones in our head that tell us get up
and go out and take that run and the ones that allow us encourage us
to continue that run and we have neurons that shut things off that say
no more and we of course have the neurons that connect to our muscles
and control our muscles but the reason we quit is rarely because our
body quits our mind quits now we never want to encourage people to
drive themselves to the point of injury that's not going to be good
for anybody but it is good to know that it's neural our ability to
persist is neural so when people say is it i hear that you know sports
or</p>
<h1 id="the-90-mental-myth"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=1639">The “90% Mental” Myth</a></h1>
<p>effort or fighting or um it's 90 mental 10 physical you know that that
whole discussion about how much is mental how much is physical is
absolutely silly it just proves that there's no knowledge of the
underlying biology behind that statement it's neither mental nor
physical everything is physical everything is neurons your thinking is
the responsibility of chemicals and electrical signals in your head so
it's not 90 percent mental 10 physical it's not 50 50. it's not 70 30.
it's 100 nervous system it's neurons okay so when people say mental or
physical understand it's 100 neural and i'd love for the how much of
of it is mental and how much is physical to just disappear that that
argument means nothing and it's not actionable</p>
<h1 id="the-critical-need-for-carbohydrates-electrolytes-sometimes-ketones"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=1690">The Critical Need For Carbohydrates &amp; Electrolytes (&amp; Sometimes Ketones)</a></h1>
<p>now what do nerves need in order to continue to fire what do you need
in order to get neurons to say i will persist well they need glucose
unless you're keto and ketogenic adapted you need carbohydrate is
glucose that's what neurons run on and you need electrolytes neurons
have what's called a sodium potassium pump blah blah blah they
generate electricity we could go into all this i will probably do an
entire lecture about the action potential but basically in order to
get nerves nerve cells to fire to contract muscle to say i'm going to
continue you need sufficient sodium salt because the action potential
the actual firing of neurons is driven by sodium entering the cell
rushing into the cell and then there's a removal of potassium and then
there's a kind of resetting of those levels by something called the
sodium potassium pump and the sodium potassium pump and sodium and
action potentials even if you don't know anything about that is atp
dependent it requires energy so you need energy in order to get
neurons to fire and it is ph dependent it depends on the conditions or
the environment within the brain being of a certain ph or acidity ph
is about how acid or how basic the environment is and we will talk a
little bit about ph in simple terms that you can understand so nerves
need salt they need potassium and it turns out they need magnesium and
you need glucose and carbohydrates in order to power those neurons
unless you are running on ketones and to run on ketones you have to
make sure that you're fully keto adapted i will talk about adding in
ketones on top of carbohydrate at the end of the episode okay so
that's how nerves work you need carbohydrate you need sodium potassium
and magnesium in order to drive the brain muscle muscle is going to
engage and generate energy first by using this</p>
<h1 id="phospho-creatine-glycogen-ph-temperature-is-key"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=1810">Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Is Key</a></h1>
<p>phospho-creatine system high bouts of effort really intense effort
short-lived seconds to minutes but probably more like seconds this
could be this phosphate creatine literally a fuel source in the muscle
that you're going to burn just like you would logs on a fire and
glycogen which is stored carbohydrate in the muscle that also can be
burned just like logs on a fire to generate energy so let me make this
crystal clear if you move your wrist towards your shoulder and
contract your bicep really hard muscle fibers are burning up their own
carbohydrate they're converting that into atp in order to generate
that energy okay and ph is important and temperature is important in
the episode on supercharge your physical performance i talked all
about how by using cooling specifically of the palms or the bottoms of
the feet or the cheeks of the face using particular methods you can
adjust the temperature of the body and of muscle in a way that allows
you to do more work to do more reps to run further to keep going and
to persist and that's because if temperature is too low or too high
then atp is not going to be available because of this whole thing
called the pyruvate kinase pathway and the temperature dependence of
pyruvate kinase check out that episode if you want to learn more about
that but temperature is important and ph is also important so we got
nerve muscle</p>
<h1 id="using-your-blood-heart-lungs-to-go-longer-further-with-more-intensity"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=1896">Using Your Blood, Heart, &amp; Lungs To Go Longer, Further, With More Intensity</a></h1>
<p>and then there's stuff in our blood that's available as an energy
source and in blood we've got glucose so literally blood sugar that's
floating around so let's say you have fasted for three days your blood
glucose is going to be very low so that's not going to be a great fuel
source but you will start to liberate fats from your adipose tissue
from your fat fatty acids will start to mobilize into the bloodstream
and you can burn those for energy and oxygen in your blood when you
inhale you're bringing oxygen into your blood so these are all fuel
sources in your neurons in your muscle in your blood in your various
tissues that are providing the opportunity to give effort to to induce
effort whether or not to run or swim or writing or talking now there
are some other factors that are important and those are the heart
which is going to move blood so the more that the heart can move blood
and oxygen well the more fuel that's going to be available for you to
engage in muscular effort and thinking effort so your heart is vitally
important to your your muscles ability to work in your brain's ability
to work and as i've mentioned oxygen a few times it should be obvious
then that the lungs are very important you need to bring oxygen in and
distribute it to all these tissues because oxygen is critical for the
conversion of carbohydrates and the conversion of fats and we could
get into the discussion about whether or not oxygen is important for
ketogenic metabolism but you need oxygen there you need to breathe and
you need to breathe properly so i just covered what would normally be
about four lectures of energy consumption and energy utilization i
didn't go into much detail at all but what i want you to imagine is
that you've got these different cell types you've got neurons you've
got muscle they need to collaborate in order to generate effort or to
make the decision to do something or to think hard or to run hard or
to run far and then you've got fuel sources both in the neurons in the
muscle in your blood and then the heart and lungs are are going to
help distribute the oxygen and those fuels and of course you have that
little energy pack that we call the liver that will allow you to pull
out a little more carbohydrate if you need it for work okay so that's
as much as i want to cover about energy consumption because that's a
lot but what it tells you is that when you eat and you use food as a
fuel source that food can be broken down and you can immediately burn
the glucose that's in your bloodstream or you can rely on some of the
stored fuel in your liver or you can rely on stored fuel in the muscle
so called glycogen and there are a lot of different ways that we can
generate atp so when we ask the question what's limiting for
performance what is going to allow us to endure to engage in effort
and endure long balance of effort or even moderately long balance of
effort we need to ask which of those things nerve muscle blood heart
and lungs is limiting or put differently we ask what should we be
doing with our neurons what should we be doing with our muscles what
should we be doing with our blood what should we be doing with our
heart and what should we be doing with our lungs that's going to allow
us to build endurance for mental and physical work and to be able to
go longer further with more intensity that's the real question how can
we do more work and the way we do that is with energy and the way to
get energy to it is by those five things and so now we're going to
talk about how you can actually build different types of endurance and
what that does at the level of your blood your heart your muscles and
your neurons so we're going to skip back and forth between protocols
tools and the underlying science so rather than heavy stack the
science at the front end and then just give you all the tools at the
end we're going to talk about the protocols the four kinds of
endurance and how to achieve them and we are going to talk</p>

<p>about the underlying science as we move through that if you would like
a lot of detailed science i encourage you to check out a review that
we've linked in the show notes and the review is called adaptations to
endurance and strength training this is a review article with many
excellent citations it's from cold spring harbor perspectives in
medicine the cold spring harbor press is an excellent scientific press
it's been the last 21 years doing summers at cold spring harbor
teaching neuroscience but cold spring harbor is involved in all sorts
of themes and topics related to neuroscience and medicine this review
by hughes elephant elephant that's the name alphasyn and bar b-a-a-r
adaptations to endurance and strength training is rich with citations
it can be downloaded as a complete pdf there's no paywall and we will
link to it and it gets really deep into all the signaling cascades the
genetic changes within muscle with high intensity interval training
short term super high intensity training uh weight training so if
you're a real nerd for this stuff and you want to get right down into
how pgc one alpha p53 and ph 20 change the adaptation features of
muscle and gene regulation that is definitely the review for you if
you're like most people and you're not really interested in that level
of detail no reason to pick up the review unless you just want to
check out some of the the figures and pictures but i do want to offer
that as a resource it's been a in addition to discussions with dr andy
galpin it's been a primary resource for the content of this</p>
<h1 id="the-4-kinds-of-endurance"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=2235">The 4 Kinds of Endurance</a></h1>
<p>episode so let's talk about the four kinds of endurance and how to
achieve those i do believe that everybody should have some sort of
endurance practice regular endurance practice it's clear that it's
vital for the functioning of the body and the mind and there are clear
longevity benefits there are a lot of reasons why that's true but the
main one is that if we have good energy utilization in our musculature
and in our blood in our vascular system and in our oxygenating system
our lungs the so-called cardiovascular system respiratory system and
musculature the body and brain function much better there are so many
papers now so much data to support that so i do believe everyone
should either try to maintain the muscle that they have provided
they've already gone through puberty and development and they should
be engaged in regular endurance exercise now for many people they
think endurance exercise that means what an hour long run or i got to
get on the stairmaster or i have to treadmill for hours on end each
week it turns out that's not the case there are four kinds of
endurance and you can train specifically for any one of those and you
can vary your training so let's talk about those four kinds of
endurance these are very interesting and they each have very different
protocols that you use in order to build and maximize them and now
you'll understand what fuel sources they use in order to build that
thing we call endurance so first of all</p>
<h1 id="muscular-endurance-powerful-for-everyone-posture-performance-resilience"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=2333">Muscular Endurance: Powerful for Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience</a></h1>
<p>we have muscular endurance muscular endurance is the ability for our
muscles to perform work over time and our failure to continue to be
able to perform that work is going to be due to muscular fatigue not
to cardiovascular fatigue so not because we're breathing too hard or
we can't get enough blood to the muscles or because we quit mentally
but because the muscles themselves give out okay one good example of
this would be if you had to pick up a stone in the yard and that stone
is not extremely heavy for you and you needed to do that anywhere from
50 to 100 times and you you're picking it up and putting it down and
picking it up and putting it down and picking up and putting it down
at some point your muscles will fatigue they will fail to endure
muscular endurance is incredibly useful for a variety of physical
pursuits and we'll talk about the mental pursuits that it supports as
well in terms of physical pursuits the ability for a given muscle to
perform repeated work is going to improve your golf swing it's going
to improve your tennis swing it's going to improve your posture your
ability to dance your ability to repeatedly engage in an activity that
requires effort in a way that's very different from the kind of
endurance that you will build simply by increasing your cardiovascular
fitness your ability to generate kind of easy repetition so let's talk
about muscular endurance and what it is muscular endurance is going to
be something that you can perform for anywhere from 12 to 25 or even
up to 100 repetitions and that's actually how if you like you would
train muscular endurance and i'll give this specific protocol in a few
moments so a good example is push-ups right if you were to get on the
floor and start doing push-ups even if you're somebody who has to do
knees down push-ups and you're doing your push-ups eventually you
won't be able to do any more push-ups and that's not going to be
because you couldn't get enough oxygen into your system or your heart
wasn't pumping enough blood it's going to be because the muscles fail
that's why so if you want to be able to do more push-ups or even more
pull-ups muscular endurance is really what it's about it's actually no
coincidence that a lot of military boot camp style training is not
done with weights it's done with things like push-ups pull-ups sit-ups
and running because what they're really building is muscular endurance
the ability to perform work repeatedly over time for a given set of
muscles and neurons so what's a good protocol to build muscular
endurance let's just give that to you now and explain some of the
underlying science as that</p>
<h1 id="protocol-for-building-muscular-endurance-no-major-eccentric-component"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=2510">Protocol For Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component</a></h1>
<p>as it follows so a really good muscular endurance training protocol
according to the scientific literature would be three to five sets of
anywhere from 12 to 100 repetitions that's a huge range now 12 to 25
repetitions is going to be more reasonable for most people and the
rest periods are going to be anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds of rest
so anywhere from half a minute to three minutes of rest so this might
be five sets of push-ups done getting your maximum push-up so for some
people that might be zero and you have to do it knees down for some
people it might be ten push-ups for some people might be 25 but you
could go all the way up to 100 rest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds
and then do your next set for a total of three to five sets so it
doesn't actually sound like a ton of work the other thing you could do
is something like a plank a plank position is actually a way to build
muscular endurance not strength okay it's i'm sure it could be used to
develop strength but it's really about muscular endurance so you would
do three to five sets of planks those planks would probably even
because you're not doing repetitions it's an isometric hold as we say
it's kind of static hold or a wall sit would be another example and
you would do that probably for a minute or two minutes take some rest
of anywhere from 30 or 60 or 180 seconds and then repeat so things
like pushing a sled push-ups isometric planks even pull-ups those will
all work and as with other forms of training you would want to do this
until you approach failure or actually fail and where you're unable to
perform another repetition that would mark the end of a set the one
critical feature of building muscular endurance is that it has no
major eccentric loading component now i haven't talked much about
eccentric and concentric loading but concentric loading is when you
are shortening the muscle typically or lifting a weight and eccentric
movements are when you are lengthening a muscle typically or lowering
a weight so if you do a pull up and you get your chin over the bar or
chin up that's the concentric portion of the effort and then as you
lower yourself that's the eccentric portion eccentric portion of
resistance training of any kind whether or not it's for endurance or
for strength is one of the major causes of soreness some people will
be more susceptible to of this to this excuse me than others but it
does create more damage in muscle fibers muscular endurance and
building muscular endurance should not include any movements that
include major eccentric loads so if you're going to do push-ups it
doesn't mean that you want to drop you know smash your chest into the
floor and by the way your chest should touch the ground on every push-
up that's a real push-up okay it's not about breaking 90 with the
elbows it's about pushing down until your chest touch the floor and
straightening out that's a proper push-up and a pull-up is where you
pull your chin above the bar neither of those should include a slow
eccentric or lowering component if you are using those to train
muscular endurance the three to five sets of 12 to 25 and maybe even
up to 100 repetitions with 30 to 180 seconds of rest in between that
means that jumping also is going to be a very poor tool for building
muscular endurance because jumping has a slowing down component as you
land so things like plyometrics or agility work where you're moving
from side to side and you're decelerating you're slowing yourself down
a lot not going to be good for muscular endurance terrific for
cardiovascular training and conditioning of other kinds and skill
training and agility and all that but if you want to build muscular
endurance you want to make your muscles able to do more work for
longer it's going to be this three to five sets of 12 to 100 reps 30
to 180 seconds of mainly concentric movement okay not a slow lowering
phase or a heavy lowering phase so that might be kettlebell swings and
things of that sort isometrics as i mentioned things like plank wall
sets will work now what's interesting about this is that it doesn't
seem at all like what people normally think of as endurance and yet
it's been shown in nice quality peer-reviewed studies several of which
are cited in the review i mentioned earlier that muscular endurance
can improve our ability to engage in long bouts of what we call long
duration low intensity endurance work so this can support long runs it
can support long swims and it can build also it can build postural
strength and endurance simultaneously and that's mainly accomplished
through isometric hold so things like planks are actually quite good
for building endurance of the spinal erector muscles that provide
posture of the abdominal muscles that are helpful for posture for
being upright for the upper neck muscles and things of that sort we
these days everyone seems to have text neck everyone's basically
staring at their toes all the time it has a default towards their toes
so isometric holds can be very good for building muscular endurance
you can spot people including yourself perhaps with poor muscular
endurance in the postural muscles because anytime they stop moving
they have to lean against a wall or their hip will move to one side or
they're always lean to one side i am guilty of this too some of you
have actually pointed out i like to think out of concern that i often
am rubbing my lower back and indeed i have some asymmetries in my
postural muscles some of which are probably genetic and some of which
are probably just from excessive work or something of that sort that
have my right shoulder sit lower than my left and things that sort if
i wanted to improve those i could improve those by really focusing on
symmetry and isometric symmetry meaning hold my holding my hands at
equivalent positions in planks and doing isometric holds for building
muscular endurance of the postural muscles but this can also be done
with as i mentioned kettlebell swings for the lower back and legs and
posterior chains so there are a number of different exercises you
could do this with but it should be compound exercises mainly it's
rare for people to do this kind of muscular endurance work
specifically for things like bicep curls or triceps and there aren't
many activities that really rely on isolation of those muscles and
repeatedly right it's hard i'm sure there are some out there but it's
kind of hard to imagine so you can do this with isometrics you can do
this with more standard non-isometric type movements but make sure
there isn't a strong eccentric load so now let's talk</p>
<h1 id="how-to-make-muscles-more-resilient-mitochondrial-respiration-neuronal-firing"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=2920">How to Make Muscles More Resilient: Mitochondrial Respiration, Neuronal Firing</a></h1>
<p>about the science briefly of why this works well that takes us back to
this issue of fuel utilization and what fails so if we were to say
okay uh let's say you do a plank uh and you're planking for you know
maybe you're able to plank for a minute or two minutes or three
minutes at some point you will fail you're not going to fail because
the heart gives out you're not going to fail because you can't get
enough oxygen because you can breathe while you're doing that you're
going to fail because of local muscular failure which means that as
you do if you choose to do this protocol of three to five sets etc etc
to build muscular endurance mainly what you are going to be building
is you're going to be building the ability of your mitochondria to use
oxygen to generate energy locally and that it's something called
mitochondrial respiration respiration because of the the involvement
of oxygen and it's also going to be increasing the extent to which the
neurons control the muscles and provide a stimulus for the muscles to
contract but this is independent of power and strength okay so even
though the the low sets like three to five sets and the fact that
you're doing repetitions and you're going to failure even though it
seems to resemble power and strength and hypertrophy type training it
is distinctly different it's not going to generate strength
hypertrophy and power it's going to mainly create this ability to
endure to continually contract muscles or repeatedly contract muscles
okay continually if you're using isometric holds repeatedly repeatedly
excuse me if you're using repetition type exercise where there's a
contraction and an extension of the muscle essentially a concentric
and an eccentric portion but remember that you want the eccentric
portion to be light and relatively fast not so fast that you injure
yourself but certainly not deliberately slowed down it was recommended
i should say by andy galpin that you not use olympic lifts for this
because once you get past 8 or 12 or 25 repetitions especially form on
those olympic lifts is key for not getting injured and while some
people can perform those sorts of of lifts like you know snatches and
deadlifts and cleans and jerks and overhead presses probably not a
great idea if the goal is to push the body to points of fatigue
because you do open yourself up to injury unless you're very skilled
at doing that or you have a really good coach who can help you guide
through those lifts so that's one form of endurance which is muscular
endurance that's mainly going to rely on neural energy so nerves and
muscle and it's not going to rely quite so much on what's available in</p>

<p>your blood your heart or your lungs so now let's talk about the other
extreme of endurance which is long duration endurance this is the type
that people typically think about when they think about endurance
you're talking about a long run a long swim a long bike ride well how
long will anywhere from 12 minutes to several hours or maybe even an
entire day maybe eight or nine hours of hiking or running or biking
some people are actually doing those kinds of really long events
marathons for instance so anything longer than 12 minutes and this
type of work builds on fuel utilization in the muscles it builds on
the activity of neurons in the brain that are involved in what we call
central pattern generators we talked about this in a previous episode
or several previous episodes these are groups of neurons that allow
our body to engage in regular rhythmic effort without having to think
about the movement too much so running and stepping or swimming if you
already know how to swim or pedaling on a bike or walking upstairs and
hiking you're not thinking about right left right left it's all
carried out by central pattern generators this is going to be at less
than 100 percent of your maximum oxygen uptake your vo2 max i'll talk
about what vo2 max is but i just want to give a sense of what the
protocol is and the underlying science how many sets one long duration
effort is one set of 12 minutes or longer so you're not counting
repetitions i sure hope that if you're going out on a 30 minute run or
even a 15 minute run that you're not counting steps that you're not
counting pedal strokes that you're not on the row or counting pulls on
the rower i suppose you could but i think that would be pretty
dreadful seems like a poor utilization of cognitive brain space you're
getting into regular repeated effort and your ability to continue that
effort is going to be dependent mainly on the efficiency of the
movement on your ability to strike a balance between the the movement
itself the generation of the muscular movements that are required and
fuel utilization across the different sources of nerve muscle blood
heart and lungs so let's ask the question why would you fail on a long
run why would you quit well as you set out on that long run assuming
you have some glycogen in your liver and in your muscles you're going
to use that energy first even if it's very low intensity okay so we're
not talking about sprinting we're talking about heading out the door
or starting off on a marathon you're starting to assuming you have
some conditioning or even if you don't you're going to burn
carbohydrate you're going to burn glucose in the bloodstream you're
going to burn carbohydrate as those muscles contract those what we
call slow twitch muscles they're contracting they start burning up
fuel to make atp to continue to contract your mind is going to use
more or less energy depending on how much will power how much of a
fight you have to get into with yourself in order to generate the
effort i really want to underscore this if you're somebody that's
thinking maybe i go for the run maybe i don't go for the run i'll do
it at two o'clock okay 205 no i only want to go on the half hour or
maybe on the main hour and you're going through all that guess what
you're burning up useful energy that you could use either for the run
for example or for something else when we think about something hard
when we ruminate when we per perseverate on on an idea or on a
decision we are burning neural energy and neural energy is glucose and
epinephrine and all the things we talked about before so willpower in
part is the ability to devote resources to things and part of that is
making decisions to just either do it or not do it i'm not of the just
do it mindset i think there's a right time and a place to train but i
also think that it is not good in other words it utilizes excessive
resources to churn over decisions excessively and you probably burn as
much cognitive energy deciding about whether or not to do a given
training or not as you do in the actual training okay so we'll talk
more about how this long-duration effort can relate to mental
performance but the long-duration effort should be one set 12 minutes
or longer it could go for 30 minutes or 60 minutes or an hour we'll
talk about programming later in the episode this is going to be less
than 100 of your maximum oxygen uptake your heart rate is not going to
be through the ceiling or maxed out but it's all about efficiency of
movement that's what you're building when you go out for a run that's
30 minutes you are building the capacity to repeat that performance
the next time while being more efficient actually burning less fuel
and that might seem a little bit counterintuitive but every time you
do that run what you're doing is you're building up mitochondrial
density it's not so much about mitochondrial oxidation and respiration
you're building up mitochondrial density you're actually increasing
the amount of atp that you can create for a given bout of effort
you're becoming more efficient okay you're burning less fuel overall
doing the same thing that's really what these long slow distance or
long ballots of effort are really all about now why do this long
duration effort why</p>
<h1 id="why-everyone-should-train-long-duration-endurance-capillaries-in-muscle-brain"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=3420">Why Everyone Should Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries In Muscle &amp; Brain</a></h1>
<p>would you want to do it why is it good for you well it does something
very important which is that it builds the capillary beds within
muscles so let's talk a little bit about vasculature we haven't done
this too much yet but if you have seen the episode on supercharging
performance we talked about avas these arteriovenous astomosis where
blood moves from arteries directly into veins but that's unusual that
only takes place in the so-called glabrous skin of the of the palms
the face and the bottoms of the feet typically for most all other
areas of the body what happens is arteries bring blood to a given
tissue like a muscle and veins return that blood back to the heart
there are exceptions but in general and in between arteries and veins
are these little tiny what are called capillary beds or
microcapillaries so these are tiny little avenues like little tiny
streams and estuaries between the bigger arteries and veins now those
are actually contained within muscle and what's amazing is that you
can increase the number of them you can literally build new
capillaries you can create new little streams within your muscles and
the type of long duration effort that i was talking about before 12
minutes or more of steady effort is very useful for doing that and is
very useful in for increasing the mitochondria the energy producing
elements of the cells the actual muscle cells and the reason is when
blood arrives to muscles it has oxygen the muscles are going to use
some of that oxygen and then some of the deoxygenated blood is going
to be sent back to the heart and to the lungs now the more capillaries
that you build into those muscles the more oxygen available to those
muscles i don't want to get too much into the physics of fluid flow
but basically it's the difference between taking a hose and sticking
it into some dirt um just directly like and turning on the faucet at a
given rate uh the spigot rather or having a bunch of little hoses like
a sprinkler system that go out and irrigate the whole yard the
irrigation is equivalent to this capillary bed system and it's very
good at using energy sources within blood so the simple way to think
about this is when you go out for a run let's say it's the first run
you've done for a while and you go out for 12 or 15 minutes and
somewhere right around 20 minutes you're like that's it i just can't
continue well when you come back the next time to do that run you've
built endurance largely because you've built these capillary beds
you've expanded these little streams in which blood can deliver oxygen
to the muscles and so it's going to feel relatively straightforward to
either go a little bit quicker for the same duration the same distance
or to extend that run for another five to ten minutes so this long
duration work unlike muscular endurance like planks and everything
that we were talking about before is really about building the
capillary systems and the mitochondria the energy utilization systems
within the muscles themselves and that's very important to understand
it's distinctly different than say building the neurons that fire the
muscles the neurons are already there they're going to fire those
muscles just fine in fact if your life depended on it today you could
probably run a marathon you'd probably get injured it would be very
psychologically and physically painful i don't recommend you do that
unless you're trained for it but if you were to train properly for it
if you were to do long duration bouts of effort once or twice a week
or three times a week pretty soon it would become easy because you're
building these vascular micro beds or microvascular beds as they're
called okay so you're able to bring more energy to the muscles and
they're able to utilize more energy so that's long duration so we've
got</p>
<h1 id="two-distinct-types-of-high-intensity-interval-training-anaerobic-aerobic"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=3660">Two Distinct Types of High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic &amp; Aerobic</a></h1>
<p>muscular endurance and we've got long duration endurance and then
there are two kinds in between that in recent years have gotten a lot
of attention and excitement but most people are not distinguishing
between these two kinds of endurance and that's a shame because in
failing to distinguish between the two kinds of what we call high
intensity training sometimes called high intensity interval training
most people perhaps you are not getting nearly as much physical and
mental benefit out of high intensity training as you could so i want
to talk about the two kinds of high intensity interval training and
what each of them does for your brain and body and what sorts of
adaptations they cause because in doing that you can really start to
build up specific energy systems in your brain and body in ways that
are best serve you for your cognitive work and for other sorts of
things like strength and speed or hypertrophy or for running marathons
for that matter so there are two kinds of high intensity training for
endurance sometimes called high intensity interval training one is
anaerobic so-called anaerobic endurance so no oxygen and the other is
aerobic endurance both of which qualify as hiit high intensity
interval training so</p>
<h1 id="anaerobic-hiit-3-12-sets-workrest-ratio-of-31-or-13-quality-of-repetitions-is-key"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=3740">Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio of 3:1 or 1:3; Quality of Repetitions is Key</a></h1>
<p>let's talk about anaerobic endurance first anaerobic endurance from a
protocol perspective is going to be 3 to 12 sets okay and these
repetitions and i'll talk about what the repetitions are are going to
be performed at whatever speed allows you to complete the work in good
safe form okay so it could be fast could be slow as the work continues
your repetitions may slow down or it may speed up chances are it's
going to slow down so what does this work what do these sets look like
remember long slow distance is one set muscular endurance is three to
five sets high intensity anaerobic endurance is going to be somewhere
between three and 12 sets and it's going to have a ratio of work to
rest of anywhere from three to one to one to five okay so what would a
three to one ratio set look like well it's going to be 30 seconds of
hard pedaling on the bike for instance or running or on the rower
these are just examples it could be in the pool swimming it could be
any number of things or air squats or you know or weighted squats if
you will provided you can manage that 30 seconds on 10 seconds off
that's a very brief rest so three to one is just a good example would
be 30 seconds on 10 seconds off the opposite extreme on that ratio be
one to five so 20 seconds on 100 seconds off so you do the work for 20
seconds then you rest 100 seconds now what's the difference what
should you do three to one ratio so 30 seconds on 10 seconds off or
should you do one to five 20 seconds on to 100 seconds off well that
will depend on whether or not the quality of the movement is important
to you so let's just take a look at the three to one ratio so in the
three to one ratio if you're going to do 30 seconds of hard pedaling
on a bike followed by 10 seconds so maybe one of these what they call
assault bikes and then you stop for 10 seconds and then repeat chances
are you will be able to do one two three four maybe even as many as 12
sets if you're really in good condition that you'll be able to do all
those because pedaling on the bike doesn't require a ton of skill and
if you do it incorrectly if your elbow flares out a little bit or
something it's very unlikely that you'll get injured unless it's
really extreme okay but the same movement done for instance with
kettlebells so 30 seconds on 10 seconds off the first set will
probably be in good form the second one will be in pretty good form
but let's say you're getting to the fifth and sixth set and you're
going 30 seconds on 10 seconds off chances are the quality of your
repetitions will degrade significantly and you increase the
probability that you're going to get injured or that you're going to
damage yourself in some way or that you can't complete the movement or
that some smaller muscles like your grip muscles might give out okay
so the quality of repetitions is going to drop considerably with the
three to one approach if you're just doing it for effort and we'll
talk about what this builds in your system in a moment that's fine but
for most people if quality of form is important so maybe this is uh
using weights maybe you're doing squats you're going to do 20 seconds
on and 100 seconds of rest maybe it's even a barbell loaded squat
maybe you're doing kettlebells maybe you've got some other resistance
there that's allowing you to do this what you'll find is that the
longer rest even though it's 20 seconds of intense effort followed by
a longer rest of about 100 seconds will allow you to perform more
quality repetitions safely over time so what does building anaerobic
endurance look like and then i'll tell you what it's actually good for
in the true practical sense what anaerobic endurance exercise
generally looks like is that if you decide to do this for the first
week you might do this two or three times a week maybe even just once
a week depending on the other things you're doing we'll talk about
programming at the end and you would generate just three sets so it
might be three sets of 20 seconds of hard effort followed by 100
seconds rest then you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort 100 seconds
rest 20 seconds whatever hard 100 seconds rest you might do that twice
a week and then each week you're adding one or two sets okay in doing
that you will build up what we call anaerobic endurance what is
anaerobic endurance well let's ask why</p>
<h1 id="maximizing-oxygen-utilization-heart-rate-nerve-muscle-energy-utilization"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=4020">Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate &amp; Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization</a></h1>
<p>we fail anaerobic endurance is going to be taking your system into
greater than 100 percent of your vo2 max it's going to be taking your
heart rate up very high and it's going to maximize your oxygen
utilization systems that is going to have effects that are going to
lead to fatigue at some point in the workout and that fatigue will
trigger an adaptation so let's ask what adaptation it's triggering
well it's triggering both mitochondrial respiration the ability of
your mitochondria to generate more energy by using more oxygen because
you're bringing so you're maxing out literally you're getting above
your vo2 max you're hitting that threshold of how much oxygen you can
use in your system one of the adaptations will be that your
mitochondria will shift such that they can use more oxygen and you're
going to also increase the capillary beds but not as much as you're
going to be able to increase the amount of neuron engagement of muscle
so normally when we start to hit fatigue when we're exhausted when
we're breathing really hard because the systems of the body are linked
and we there's a mental component to this as well a kind of
motivational component after that third or fourth or sixth set of you
know 20 seconds on 100 seconds off or if you're at the other extreme
30 seconds on and 10 seconds off there's going to be a component of
you want to stop and by pushing through and repeating another set
safely of course what you're doing is you are training the neurons to
be able to access more energy literally convert that into atp and for
the muscles therefore to access more energy and atp and the adaptation
is in the mitochondria's ability to use oxygen and this has tremendous
carryover effects for other types of exercise so while i know and
appreciate that people are using high intensity interval training of
this kind or similar in order to just like burn fat you know do their
workouts quote unquote it's very useful for building a capacity to
engage in short bouts of effort repeatedly to really lock in i don't
want to use the word focus because it's not strictly mental focus but
to be able to to generate short bouts of very intense work this can be
beneficial in competitive sports or team sports where there's a
sprinting component where the field opens up and you need to dribble
the ball down the field for instance and shoot on goal or where you're
playing tennis and it's a long rally and then all of a sudden somebody
really starts you know putting you back on your heels and you have to
really make the maximum amount of effort to run to the net and to get
the ball across that things of that sort okay there are a variety of
places where there's carryover from this type of training but it does
support endurance it's about muscle endurance it's about these muscles
ability to generate a lot of force in the short term but repeatedly
okay so that's the way to conceptualize this and it is different than
maximum power even though it feels like maximum effort it is not the
same as building power and speed into muscles those are distinctly
different protocols so the key elements again are that you're bringing
your breathing and your oxygen utilization way up above your max it's
not quite hitting failure but you're really pushing the system to the
point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin
another set you're not necessarily psychologically ready i'll talk
more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke
volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this
sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to
our lungs and other tissues i'm going to get very specific about how
to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's
happening at the level of the heart but i want to make sure i touch on
the fourth protocol which is high intensity aerobic</p>
<h1 id="aerobic-hiit-11-workrest-ratio-tapping-into-all-energy-utilization-systems"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=4259">Aerobic HIIT; 1:1 Work:Rest Ratio, Tapping Into All Energy Utilization Systems</a></h1>
<p>conditioning so hit has these two forms anaerobic and aerobic and you
just heard about anaerobic high-intensity aerobic conditioning also
involves about three to twelve sets starting off of course with fewer
sets as you're getting into this training and then extending into more
sets as one parameter you could expand has again the same ratio of
three to one so 30 seconds on 10 seconds off or one to five 20 seconds
on 100 seconds off or a very powerful tool for building up aerobic
conditioning is a one-to-one ratio a one-to-one ratio is powerful for
building on average most of the energy systems involving remember we
have these nerve muscle blood heart and lungs a one to a one to one
ratio might be you run a mile and however long that takes let's say it
takes you six minutes or seven minutes then you rest for an equivalent
amount of time then you repeat it and then you rest for an equivalent
amount of time so you might run first mile is let's say seven minutes
then you rest for seven minutes then you run a mile again and it might
take eight minutes and you rest for eight minutes and you continue
that for a total of four miles of work for four miles of running work
i should say or seven miles of work you can build this up many people
find that using this type of training allows them to do things like go
run half marathons in marathons even though prior to the race date
they've never actually run a half marathon or marathon now that might
seem incredible it's like how could it be that running a mile on and
then and then resting for running a mile and then resting for an
equivalent amount of time running them out resting for equivalent
amount of time for seven miles allows you to run continuously for 13
miles or for 26 miles well i'm not discouraging people from ever doing
the long duration endurance i think that is very important but it's
because it builds up so many of these energy utilization systems it
really teaches you to engage excuse me the nerve to muscle firing it
improves atp and mitochondrial function in muscle it allows the blood
to deliver more oxygen to the muscle and to your brain and i'll
explain how that is and it allows your heart to deliver more oxygen
overall and it builds a tremendous lung capacity and we will talk
about exactly how to breathe and how to build lung capacity both for
sake of warming up and for performance so what would this look like
and when should you do this um well it's really a question for these
workouts of asking how much work can one do in 8 to 12 minutes right
and then rest and then repeat how much work can you do for eight to
twelve minutes then rest and then repeat and how many times should you
do this well this is the sort of thing it's pretty intense and so you
would probably only want to do this two maybe three times a week if
you're not doing many other things i will talk about how this program
can be moved in with other forms of training but i'll just give you a
little hint now it's very clear and it's described in the review
article referred to and we will link another article as well that
concurrent training doing strength training and the endurance training
of any of the four cons that i'm describing today can be done you can
program those in the same week but you want to get four and ideally
six or even better 24 hours between these workouts because it is very
hard for instance to do a one-to-one mile repeats like run a mile rest
for equivalent time run a mile rest for equivalent time to do that two
or three times a week and also do weight training before or do a long
run afterwards that would quickly lead to breakdown for most people
unless you have very very good energy utilization systems you're a
really kind of advanced or elite athlete and or dare i say you're
using tools to enhance your performance at the level of blood or
hormones and i'm actually going to talk about those at the end and why
they work so we have four kinds of endurance muscular endurance we
have long duration endurance we have high intensity interval training
of two kinds anaerobic and aerobic and this last type the aerobic one
works best it seems if you kind of do this one-to-one ratio so how
would you use these and what are they actually doing</p>

<p>let's talk about the heart and the lungs and oxygen because that's
something that we can all benefit from understanding and it will
become very clear in that discussion why this type of training is very
useful even for non-athletes in order to improve oxygenation and
energy utilization of the brain and the heart the brain and the heart
are probably the two most important systems that you need to take care
of in your life yes your musculature needs to be maintained if you
want to build it that's up to you but you should try and maintain your
musculature but maintaining or enhancing brain function and
cardiovascular function it's absolutely clear our key for health and
longevity in the short and long term and the sorts of training i
talked about today has been shown again and again and again to be very
useful for enhancing the strength of the mind yes i'll talk about that
as well as the health of the brain and the body so let's talk about
the sorts of adaptations that are happening in your brain and body
that are so beneficial in these different forms of training if you are
breathing hard and your heart is beating hard so this would be
certainly in the high intensity anaerobic and aerobic conditioning
because you're getting up near your vo2 max in high intensity aerobic
conditioning and you're exceeding your vo2 max in high intensity
anaerobic conditioning what's going to happen is as of course your
heart beats faster your blood is going to be circulating faster in
principle oxygen utilization in muscles is going to go up and over
time not long very quickly what will happen when those capillary beds
start to expand we talked about that but in addition because of the
amount of blood that's being returned to the heart when you engage in
these really intense bouts of effort repeatedly the amount of blood
being returned to the heart actually causes an eccentric loading of
one of the muscular walls of the heart so your heart is muscle it's
cardiac muscle we have skeletal muscle attached to our bones and we
have cardiac muscle which is our heart when more blood is being
returned to the heart because of the additional work that your muscles
and nerves are doing it actually has the effect of creating an
eccentric loading a kind of pushing of the wall the left i realize i'm
not using the strict anatomy here but i don't want to get into all the
features of the structural features of the heart but the left
ventricle essentially getting slammed back and then having to push
back in a kind of eccentric loading of the cardiac muscle and the
muscle thickens but not because the heart thickens overall it's
actually a strengthening of the cardiac muscle in a way that increases
what we call stroke volume meaning as more blood is returned to the
heart there's an adaptation where the heart muscle actually gets
stronger and therefore can pump more blood per stroke per beat and as
it does that it delivers because blood cont contains glucose and
oxygen and other things it delivers more fuel to your muscles which
allows you to do yet more work per unit time okay so when we hear that
oh you know uh so-and-so has a or maybe you have a nice low heart rate
that you know maybe you're one of these really extreme folks like 30
or 40 beats per minute although most people are sitting at 50 60 70 80
that's your resting heart rate if you exercise regularly and you do
long duration aerobic work your heart rate will start to go down your
resting heart rate it will increase the stroke volume of your heart if
you do this high intensity type training where your heart is beating
very hard so maybe the one-to-one ratio mile run repeats that i
described a minute ago so you do that twice a week for three or four
and i said it could go all the way up to 12 sets which is a lot i
don't recommend people start there pretty soon the stroke volume of
your heart will really increase and as a consequence you can deliver
more fuel to your muscles and to your brain and you will notice that
you can do more work meaning you can do the same work you were doing a
few days or weeks ago with relative ease your cognitive functioning
will improve this has been shown again and again because there's an
increase in vasculature literally capillary beds within the brain the
hippocampus areas that support memory but also areas of the brain that
support respiration that support focus that support effort this isn't
often discussed but the ability to deliver more blood and therefore
more glucose remember neurons run on glucose and oxygen to the brain
is a big feature of why exercise of the kind i'm describing</p>

<p>helps with brain function now weight training does have some positive
effects on brain function also when i say weight training i'm really i
should be more specific i really am referring to strength and
hypertrophy training strengthen hypertrophy training especially if
it's of the sort where you get into the burn as we talked about last
episode and you start generating lactate as a hormonal signal that can
benefit your brain etc it can have positive effects on the brain and
frankly there haven't been as many studies of resistance training
strength and hypertrophy training on brain function mainly because
most of those experiments are done in mice or primates non-human
primates i should say and um it's hard to get mice to do resistance
training okay it's hard to get humans to do resistance training it's
definitely hard to get mice to do resistance training there are ways
to do it but it's hard to get them to do say you know three sets of
eight on the deadlift and then do some curls and then do some chin ups
and this kind of thing okay it's pretty easy to get a mouse to run on
a treadmill and you can set the tension on that treadmill to make it
so that it's easier or harder for the mouse to turn that wheel so
that's one of the reasons however it's very clear and you should now
understand intuitively why the kind of standard strength and
hypertrophy type workouts are not going to activate the blood
oxygenation and the stroke volume increases for the heart that the
sorts of training i'm talking about today will it just doesn't have
the same positive effects now that isn't to say that if you just
weight train that you'll be dumb or that you'll lose your your memory
over time you might but it is to say that endurance work in particular
the high intensity and long duration work that i've talked about today
the two high intensity protocols and the long duration work has been
shown again and again and again to have positive effects on brain
function not through the addition of new neurons sorry to break break
it to you but that's not a major event in the exercised or non-
exercised human brain for reasons we can talk about in a future
episode but it still has many positive effects through the delivery of
things like igf-1 but also just through plane oxygenation of the brain
and the way it promotes the development of microvasculature to devel
to excuse me to deliver neurons more nutrients if neurons don't get
oxygen and glucose they do die unless there's another fuel source like
ketones which can replace the glucose if you don't give oxygen to
neurons if you don't deliver enough to them you get what's called
ischemia you get little microstrokes so the type of exercise i'm
talking about today in generating intense heart rate increases
provided that's safe for you to do breathing hard that's going to
deliver oxygen and blood increased stroke volume of the heart and is
going to improve brain function that's been supported by many many
quality peer-reviewed studies so that's one form of positive
adaptation i also talked about just sort of performance adaptations
how doing high intensity aerobic conditioning of the you know mild
repeats type training can actually improve your ability to do long
bouts of intense work it also seems like it dovetails or is compatible
with</p>

<p>resistance training that's aimed towards strength and hypertrophy now
in full disclosure the data seem to indicate that if people just
weight train or train for strength so three reps um rest five minutes
three reps of heavy weights etc yeah you'll get much stronger than you
would if you're doing things like you know five repetitions up to 12
or 12 to 25 reps and you're you know and you're going out for long
jogs there's always going to be a compromise in adaptations
unfortunately it does seem like you can do concurrent training as i
mentioned before if you allow anywhere from four to six or ideally 24
hours between workouts as i mentioned in the previous episode if you
want to know if you are recovered from a workout a great way to do
that is to apply the carbon dioxide tolerance test which is four
breaths in and out inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale inhale
exhale then a big inhale and then a slow controlled exhale if that
slow controlled exhale is 60 seconds or longer it means that your
parasympathetic your calming nervous system is under your control and
it's likely i should say likely that systemically your whole nervous
system has recovered from whatever it is that you've been doing and
experiencing in life including work and relationships if not you might
want to take a rest day dare i say or costello's on is what he's 10
now i think he's on his 12 000th rest day um most people need i should
say one to two full rest days per week i know there are people gonna
say that's ridiculous and okay maybe you have uh amazing recovery
abilities it also depends on training intensity many people benefit
from having one or two full rest days per week at least one some
people don't need to but if you are not able to extend that exhale on
the carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds or so 45 seconds 60
seconds chances are your so-called sympathetic nervous system your
stress system is chronically elevated and you're not really putting
the brake on that system enough and that's a subconscious thing there
are ways that you can accelerate recovery but i would encourage you to
listen to the previous episode it's time stamped for how to assess
recovery so how often to program these things will depend on the other
things you're doing i think it's perfectly reasonable to do this type
of training with other types of training and i'll talk about a variety
of combinations of those toward the end of the episode i do want to
talk</p>

<p>about how to deliver more energy and oxygen these are tools that are
extremely useful i believe and that are grounded in physiology the
three things i'd like to talk about are how to breathe what to do
immediately after training and hydration and i promise i will get back
into programming and sort of protocols but i these are vitally
important to your ability to perform endurance work in particular and
they're grounded in how neurons and blood and oxygen and your heart
work together so let's first talk about breathing or respiration we
breathe a couple of different ways but let's just remind ourselves why
we breathe we breathe to bring oxygen into our system and we breathe
to get rid of carbon dioxide and we need both oxygen and carbon
dioxide in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work
it's not that oxygen is good and carbon dioxide is bad they have to be
present in the appropriate ratios so one thing that is very clear is
our ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles and to our brain is
going to be important for our ability to generate muscular effort
especially of the kind of was talking about today but also weight
training and other forms of skill based effort etc and our ability to
think if you're holding your breath for too long if you're breathing
too much if you're what they call over breathing or under breathing if
you're shallow breathing if you're mouth breathing these are all
things that can really impede mental and physical performance so let's
make it really simple and then i promise to do a future episode all
about respiration there are two main sources of air for your body and
it's air coming in through your nose and air coming in through your
mouth in general nasal breathing is better it scrubs the air of
bacteria and viruses you have a microbiome in your nose that benefits
there are a number of reasons it's also just a more efficient system
believe it or not even though it feels like you can gulp more air with
your mouth getting good at nasal breathing is useful a gear system of
the type that brian mckenzie and colleagues have developed i think is
a good way to conceptualize this if you're doing long duration work
try and do it all nasal breathing if you have deviated septum it's
probably because you don't nasal breathe enough mouth breathing is
something that you know many people suffer from it you're more prone
to infections it's not as in efficient etc there is a place for mouth
breathing however it's usually if you need to do a strong exhale often
times you can discard more volume through the mouth unless you're very
trained at nasal breathing so if you're doing high intensity training
a good way to conceptualize this is to exhale on the max effort and
then to inhale on the less intense part so that might be as you're
generating the movement you know you in the concentric part of the
movement you exhale right just like on a bat swing or something like
that or you know fighters and martial artists do this differently
depending on how they were trained and the different purposes but the
kind of like or the kind of exhaling um during the effort and then
inhaling on the portion of the repetition that is not the highest
effort portion usually that's the eccentric phase of anything
involving weights or rowing and things of that sort so nasal breathing
is great but as you increase the intensity of your endurance work you
will need to incorporate the mouth so a gear system would look
something like first gear would be just nasal breathing or second gear
would also be just nasal breathing but with more effort third gear
again power speed endurance has a lot more about this you can go to
their website i think it's a very intelligent way to conceptualize
this um as you go into more max effort then you're going to you know
third and fourth and fifth gear and at some point you're not thinking
about nose or mouth you're just trying to hang on for dear life and
complete the work safely and that means breathe through uh whatever uh
orifice uh works for you so that's one aspect nose versus mouth the
other aspect is whether or not you're using your ribs the intercostal
muscles are</p>
<h1 id="intercostals-diaphragmatic-breathing-warming-up-intercostals-is-useful"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=5390">Intercostals &amp; Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Up Intercostals Is Useful</a></h1>
<p>these muscles that the bruce lee had these you know remarkable
intercostal muscles that allow you to lift the rib cage or the
diaphragm which is a skeletal muscle that sits below the lungs just to
remind you when you inhale the diaphragm moves down when you exhale
the diaphragm moves up okay here's something that most people don't do
and would benefit tremendously from and i can say this because andy
galpin's lab has done work on this exploring how warming up the
intercostals and the nerve to diaphragm pathways before any kind of
endurance work or in the first few minutes of endurance work can allow
you to breathe more deeply and to deliver more oxygen to the blood and
excuse me end to the muscles and to be able to do more work more
efficiently so what that involves is sometimes sitting sometimes
standing and just really concentrating on two things we always hear
about how we should diaphragmatic breathe and that means our belly
moves out when we inhale so our our stomach expands but also expanding
the intercostals which means actually raising the ribs chest breathing
we're all told that you know in yoga class don't breathe with your</p>
<h1 id="increasing-motivation-adrenaline"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=5460">Increasing Motivation &amp; Adrenaline</a></h1>
<p>chest this but actually that is is warming up the intercostal muscles
so this is also a great way to generate adrenaline if you do it a
little bit intensely so let's say you're feeling un motivated to train
i don't particularly like doing endurance training until i'm actually
doing it um so i i use and benefit from having a practice where i'll
just sit there and for about three minutes i'll just breathe very
deeply trying to raise my chest as much as i can for maybe a minute
and then expanding my contracting my diaphragm and expanding my
stomach outward when i inhale by the end of that you're actually
delivering more oxygen to your system um my lab has looked at this in
a totally different context andy's lab has looked at it in the context
of physical performance so warming up the breathing muscles should
make sense given that you now know that muscles and neurons need
glucose and they need oxygen in order to function and so that's a
great warm-up you can also do this while walking or while getting on
the bike and starting to pedal really starting to think about warming
up the breathing system and then you can decide if you want to do pure
nasal or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing and so on so
that's something that we</p>
<h1 id="eliminating-the-side-cramp-with-physiological-sighs"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=5530">Eliminating the “Side Cramp” With Physiological Sighs</a></h1>
<p>don't often hear about the other one the other tool rather that i've
talked about in a previous episode i'll just mention again is some
people when they do endurance type work they get a stitch in their
side they feel like they've got a side cramp very rarely is it
actually a skeletal muscular cramp it's oftentimes it's a referenced
pain of the phrenic nerve that innervates the liver so the phrenic
nerve is responsible for the movement of the diaphragm it is a very
important system but it has a number of what we call collateral so it
branches to other organs runs over other organs sometimes when we're
breathing shallow and we are in physical motion and we're engaging in
physical effort we'll feel that side stitch we think oh i've got a
cramp or maybe i'm dehydrated or maybe i need to run with my hands
over my head my head excuse me typically you can relieve that side
cramp which isn't a cramp at all that side stitch by doing the double
inhale exhale really breathing deeply and then sneaking a little bit
more air in that's a double kind of firing or what we call volley of
action potential sent from the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm which
will also activate that collateral that branch literally of the nerve
that innervates the liver and then when you exhale you offload a bunch
of carbon dioxide but if you repeat that a few times often in fact for
me every time but often what will happen is that side stitch will just
naturally disappear just means you're not breathing properly your the
phrenic nerve is is firing in a way that's kind of aggravating that
referenced pain there's nothing kind of voodoo or mysterious about
this it just has to do with the way that the different nerves uh
travel in the body so as you set out on your run or maybe you're going
to do some muscular endurance work or high intensity work warming up
the intercostals warming up the diaphragm is is good and there there
are exercises there is work that you can do to strengthen the
intercostals and to strengthen the diaphragm during bouts of this kind
of effort and i would say that one of the ways that you can do that
best is by really focusing on getting the maximum diaphragmatic
expansion and chest lifting what we're all told now not to do don't
you know don't chest breathe belly breathe the intercostals are there
for a reason and they are perfectly good at filling your lungs they
work best when they collaborate with your diaphragm but when you're
starting to fatigue to start to really inhale deeply and try and
really expand those to deliver more oxygen to your system while we're
talking about delivering more oxygen to your system i want to share
with you a useful tool</p>
<h1 id="accelerating-through-the-wall-accessing-alternative-fuel-sources-ketone-use"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=5685">Accelerating Through “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone Use</a></h1>
<p>that will now make total sense mechanistically why it works which is
often times when we are on a long run or in long duration bouts of
effort we will hit the so-called wall right we will bonk i think they
used to call it or maybe do they still call it that costello he's
asleep we bonk we just we think no we can't continue it's a curious
thing as to whether or not that's neural or whether or not it's fuel-
based there's certainly going to be a psychological or motivational
component but one way that you can reveal this kind of extra gear the
capacity to push on is by understanding the way that different muscle
fibers use energy differently remember the fast twitch phosphor
creatine system and the slow twitch system that relies mainly on
lipids and glucose okay well even if you don't remember all that if
you've been running steadily for a long time and you're starting to
fatigue and you feel like it's time to quit you may have not tapped
into an alternative fuel source one thing that you can do is you can
actually increase your speed this is also true of work where you're
doing repetitions with kettlebells or something you can start to
increase your speed so run faster pedal faster row faster swim faster
not all out sprint but in doing that you're shifting the muscles and
the nerves over towards utilizing a separate fuel source or a distinct
fuel source maybe the phosphocreatine system if it's a quick bout of
intense acceleration or maybe it's a combination of lipids and
carbohydrates in your system that weren't available to you prior now
of course if you completely deplete your liver glycogen you completely
deplete everything you're only going to be running on stored fuel and
fats and and eventually you'll start metabolizing protein muscles
themselves but this is a kind of a a unique way to realize that oh you
weren't uh you weren't out of energy at all you were just over relying
on one fuel source and this is the reason why especially elite
athletes are starting to both rely on carbohydrates so they're doing
the whole carb depletion then carb loading thing they're loading up
their liver and their muscles with plenty of glycogen by eating pastas
and rice and stuff before races but they are also ingesting ketones
during races during long ballots of effort because ketones can be a
quick form of energy there's no reason why you can't use ketones if
they are taken exogenous ketones and carbohydrate and in combination
remember the body is accustomed to using multiple fuel sources fatty
acids carbohydrates all these things it's only in the you know kind of
internet age that we think in terms of oh well you're either keto or
you're burning sugar or you're you know fat adapted or you're fat
fasting or fast fasting or fat fatting costello woke up when i said
fat fatting i'm not talking about you costello so the the point is
that your body is used to using multiple fuel sources so if you're
kind of hitting that wall sometimes accelerating can actually allow
you to tap into a new fuel source or combination of fuel sources just
based on the way that muscles use fuel so that's another tool the
other thing that's really important to think about in terms of
endurance type work</p>
<h1 id="hydration-why-hydrate-how-to-hydrate-how-much-fluid-to-drink"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=5870">Hydration: Why Hydrate, How To Hydrate, &amp; How Much Fluid To Drink</a></h1>
<p>is hydration and i think hydration is important for all forms of
physical work and exercise not just endurance the deal with hydration
is that we've been taught about hydration all wrong but let's remember
what neurons work on what what do they use in order to fire well they
certainly need water right we need water in our system i should say
but they remember they use electrolyte sodium and potassium to
generate those action potentials to actually get neurons to contract
to be able excuse me muscles to contract and for our brain to function
and to be able to think typically typically we're going to lose
anywhere from one to five pounds of water per hour of exercise and
that's going to vary tremendously it's going to vary on weather it's
going to vary on intensity probably more like five pounds if it's hot
day and you're exercising very intensely so about one to five pounds
per hour now you know how much you weigh so if you think about your
weight in pounds once you lose about one to four percent of your body
weight in water you're going to experience about a 20 to 30 percent
reduction in work capacity in your ability to generate effort of any
kind strength endurance etc you are also going to experience a
significant drop in your ability to think and perform mental
operations so hydration is key now many people have been told well if
you urinate and your urine is clear well then you're hydrated enough
sometimes that's true sometimes that's not true also and this isn't a
topic i enjoy um discussing but urine is a biological phenomenon it's
actually filtered blood um every once in a while if there's a kid and
it's a family friend i'll say did you know that your pee is actually
filtered blood and they usually kind of go wide-eyed but then they go
oh that's kind of cool like kids have this natural curiosity about
blood and pee and stuff that's not contaminated by our preconceived
notions of those things being gross because urine being filtered blood
can give you some indication as to whether or not you're hydrated
enough or not and in order to really assess that it's not going to be
sufficient to urinate into another volume of water and assess whether
or not your urine is very dark or very light it actually requires
urinating into a small volume and saying well is it darker or lighter
than before it's not something you really want to do most places um
the etiquette of most gyms and environments is not suitable for that
but one of the things that you can just do is you can figure well i'm
going to lose one to five pounds of water per hour you can show up to
exercise reasonably hydrated with electrolytes so potassium sodium and
magnesium are really key yes it's true you can die from drinking too
much water in particular because it forces you if you drink too much
water you'll excrete too many electrolytes and your brain will shut
off you'll actually your heart will stop functioning properly so you
don't want to over consume water to the extreme either but there are a
number of equations that go into figuring out how much water you need
based on how intense you're training etc body size etc just remember
you burn you lose excuse me about one to five pounds of of water per
hour depending on how hot it is and how intensely you're exercising
once your body weight drops by one to four percent so you can just
figure well if you lose five pounds per hour you exercise for two
hours let's say you're about 200 pounds that's about 10 okay well you
want to replace that before you very quickly or not you want to
replace that all along before you start experiencing this massive
20-30 reduction in work capacity of muscles in</p>

<p>the brain a simple formula what i call the galpin equation hereafter
referred to as the galpin equation is a formula that gets you close to
the exact amount that you would want that dr andy galpin came up with
which is your body weight in pounds divided by the number 30 and that
is how many ounces you should drink for every 15 minutes of exercise
so once again the galloping equation your body weight in pounds
divided by 30 that's the amount of of fluid to drink in ounces right
every 15 minutes of exercise now if you are sweating a lot you may
need more okay if you're already very well hydrated you may need less
but that's a good rule of thumb to begin and to start to understand
the relationship between hydration and performance there is a
phenomenon in which gastric emptying the ability to move stuff out of
your gut including water and electrolytes out of your gut and into the
bloodstream and for delivery to the tissues of your body for effort is
hindered when you get above 70 of your vo2 max in other words when
you're doing high intensity training sometimes people experience that
ingesting water during intense training is difficult it is something
that can be actually trained up it's a matter of learning to kind of
relax the your abdominal muscles and there's some other aspects of
adaptation that will allow you to drink during higher intensity work
as galpin says don't try and ingest fluids when you're working out or
competing at higher than 70 of vo2 max if you've never done it before
you want to train up this capacity people can learn how to consume
fluids during a race or consume fluids during bouts of exercise that
are very intense and a lot of people don't want to do that because
they don't want to have to stop to urinate etc but given the crucial
role of hydration for muscular performance and for brain performance
it seems that if you're going to be doing a lot of high intensity
interval training of the various kinds we talked about today or high
intensity training of any kind that hydration is key and learning or
in other words getting your system to adapt to ingesting fluids in the
middle of these workouts is something that seems beneficial at least
to me in terms of the trade-off between being dehydrated and the
somewhat discomfort of maybe drinking some fluids so you sip small
amounts of fluid initially and then you're able to take bigger and
bigger gulps as time goes on and pretty soon um you're able to drink
mid-set or be excuse me not mid-set please don't do that between sets
and your workout or while you're still breathing hard after a mile
repeat or something of that sort without much disruption or</p>

<p>any at all to your performance last episode we talked about how to
assess recovery and things that you might want to do to improve
recovery how exposure to ice baths and cold showers can reduce
inflammation which can be great for recovery but can inhibit some of
the adaptations for strength and hypertrophy because inflammation
isn't good or bad inflammation isn't like a nice person or a mean
person it's both it's a great thing for stimulating adaptations but
you don't want it around too long and so we suggested that you not do
ice baths within probably six hours of any training where the goal was
hyper hypertrophy or strength training there is some evidence that
getting yourself into an ice bath or cold shower after endurance
training can actually improve the mitochondrial uh aspects of
endurance exercise that you can get improvements in mitochondrial
density and you can get improvements in mitochondrial respiration by
doing that afterwards and that it can facilitate recovery that's still
a bit of a controversial area i do think that what i mentioned earlier
that waiting at least six hours and probably more like 24 hours
between workouts is a good idea that getting at least one full day of
rest each week for some people that'll be two i have to say i'm one of
these people that after two days of absolutely no exercise i do
perform better consistently across all aspects of physical performance
and mentally i feel better as well even though i loathe to take those
days off unless i'm really exhausted it does seem to help my training
some people can train seven days a week and they're fine i think it
just is there's a lot of individual variation you want to work on
sleep and maximizing</p>

<p>sleep for recovery nutrition of course as well i talked about sleep in
the first four episodes of the podcast so if you have trouble with
sleep definitely check out those episodes it's very clear and a number
of sports teams um even some folks that i work with uh and andy galpin
and others are starting to incorporate a what's called a
parasympathetic down regulation after training of any kind as a way to
accelerate recovery and enable you to do more work in other words get
back to work out sooner what is parasympathetic down regulation it
means finishing your your training and instead of just hopping on the
phone or hopping into your car and and um heading off to take five
minutes minimum maybe ideally more like 10 or 20 but for sake of time
five minutes minimum and doing just some slow pure nasal long exhale
devoted breathing we're lying down and just kind of zoning out that it
seems can accelerate recovery and allow you to get back into other
types of work mental work or physical work more quickly which makes
total sense because remember your nervous system and recovery and work
is a local phenomenon which muscles were you using you know were you
using your your glutes your hams and your and your back or where
you're using your shoulders etc but it's also a systemic thing it's
also about those neurons and the locus ceruleas that are releasing
epinephrine you want to quiet all that down after training you want to
really just zone out think costello channel your inner costillo and
just mellow out for five to 20 minutes and then move into the rest of
your day five minutes should be manageable even if it's just sitting
in the car with your eyes closed doing that down regulation breathing
i think you'll see big benefits in terms of allowing yourself to come
back sooner do more work over time and just perform and feel better
generally as well as be able to think about other things besides the
just how much the previous workout kind of beat you up a couple more
things i think are going to be useful and i do want to just pack these
in because we are closing out</p>
<h1 id="leveraging-the-visual-system-during-effort-milestones-dilation-contraction-pacing"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=6480">Leveraging The Visual System During Effort, Milestones; Dilation &amp; Contraction; Pacing</a></h1>
<p>the month on physical performance and that's about programming and
about pacing and the kind of mental aspects of endurance so let's
start with pacing and mental aspects of endurance i learned from a
friend and colleague here at the podcast that who's very active in
triathlon and marathon and other knows a lot about that whole world
and the competitive landscape there that pacing and literally physical
pacers of a laser on the ground or visualizing or having a pace car or
a pace runner in front is actually not allowed in many competitions
and if those are present doesn't allow the race times to qualify as
legitimate record-holding times and that's very interesting to me
because what we know is that the visual system has this capacity to
switch back and forth between what we call panoramic vision where
we're not really focused on anything things are just flowing past us
or our eyes are just kind of zoned out so i can do this right now and
you won't be able to tell but i'm looking at the corners of the room i
see costillo down there on the floor i see my podcast team here and i
can also see the microphone i can see myself in this environment
that's panoramic vision whereas if i draw my eyes to one location like
right there in the center of the camera it's what's called a virgin's
eye movement so i'm contracting my visual window the contraction of
the visual window when that's done is the same thing that would happen
if i was tracking say a pace car or a pace runner or a laser on the
ground the mirror bringing our eyes together to what we call a
vergence point has the impact of triggering the activation of neural
circuits in the thalamus things like zona and serta if you really want
to know what their names are of these brain areas as well as in the
brain stem that activate the so-called alertness system things like
locus ceruleus whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us into states
of relaxation you can actually leverage this during your runs let's
say you're out for a long run or you're swimming or you're cycling
this is probably easiest to imagine out of the water but you probably
do in the water as well if you focus your attention on a landmark that
you're going to run to you'll find that it's much easier than if you
don't actually have a set milestone or landmark that you're going to
run to however if you were to continue that repeatedly just going
milestone after milestone after milestone you would feel more mentally
fatigued and you would actually be able to generate less work overall
one thing that can be useful is focusing on a milestone running to
that milestone or biking whatever it is the activity happens to be and
then dilating your field of view to relax the system and then
continuing again so it's this kind of active contraction or of the
visual window and then dilation of the visual window contraction the
visual window allows you to generate more effort but there's a cost to
doing that because neurons consume energy and now you know how they do
that whereas dilation allows you to essentially be more efficient
right now pacing is not allowed or having a pace or a visual pacer
because it does allow you to access systems in the brain and body that
allow you to create more energy more effort and so i find it
interesting that i think in a kind of subconscious genius the race
officials and the the governing bodies of these of these races have
said okay sure having a pacer there or someone in front you can draft
off of them there's actually a kind of a aerodynamic effect of having
someone in front of you that makes it easier to run in the wake of
their of their airstream so to speak same is true in cycling this is
why the cycling teams are so good at maneuvering in packs in very
specific ways you can go faster with less effort if you're drafting as
it's called behind somebody but as well where you place your vision
will allow you to generate more effort and so it's interesting that
they've taken out this kind of um if you will performance enhancing
tool i imagine and i have to imagine it's the appropriate word here
that ra good runners good cyclists have the ability to create a kind
of pacer in their mind's eye i have to imagine that they're not just
completely allowing their attention to drift although they do that
when they want to be in highly efficient mode generating effort
without having to tax their mental capacity and remember mental
capacity is neural energy and consumes glucose energy that they could
devote to the functioning of their body but that when needed that they
can focus their energy in and actually kind of chase a mental pacer or
pick milestones so this is a mental game that you can play as well
it's a little bit hard to do in the context of weightlifting in the
gym it's more of a moving through space kind of thing but some people
do this by counting reps etc i think it's especially suitable for
endurance type of exercise especially done outside one of the reasons
i hate running on a treadmill is it just feels like it's never ending
and i i've never tried one of these peloton things i try and avoid
looking at screens as much as i possibly can but if you try this next
time you're out for a run or a swim what you'll find is that you have
a capacity to engage a system of higher energy</p>

<p>output when you focus your eyes on a particular location but you want
to use that judiciously because your goal of course is to become
efficient at moving through space over time and not taxing your brain
and body to the point where you arrive at the end of that unless it's
race day just completely tapped out so that's a kind of interesting
aspect of running if you're a fan of running which i am and you get
the chance to look at any of the documentaries or docu-dramas made
about excuse me about steve prefontaine it was clear that he was
mostly in a battle with himself but that he was also a highly
competitive individual and you'll see this in some of his races i do
encourage you to look some of those up on on youtube or see the
docudramas they're quite good where he ran that the essentially was 12
laps on a track it's essentially the five it is the 5 000 meter race
which essentially three three miles and he essentially tried to sprint
the whole thing which is ridiculous actually knowing what you know
today you'll realize that steve prefontaine basically was pulling from
strength speed power muscular endurance long duration effort high
intensity aerobic anaerobic has sort of tried to maximize every fuel
system and you'll see that in the the races that he runs but that when
runners are nearing the final laps the so-called bell lap of a race
they'll often look to one another to see where somebody is obviously
to assess their progress and and how close somebody is but when
somebody gets passed oftentimes you'll see someone access this
mysterious kick this ability to tap into some additional gear that
allows them to run forward or faster when they themselves actually
thought that they were maxed out so someone could be running for the
finish line they're convinced they're going to win they're going max
effort or at least they perceive max ever someone passes them and all
of a sudden max effort has changed because of that visual target they
are able to access higher levels of speed and output and effort and
performance they don't always catch up to that person and win but
having a target a milestone is a powerful way that we can generate
more force and energy in anything and the visual system is the way
that we bring those milestones into our brain which then brings about
epinephrine which brings about neural firing which allows us to access
whatever resources happen to be available to us so i find this
fascinating because people often wonder like where does the kick come
from where is this kind of gift of an additional gear where is that
deeper resource and we often express it and talk about it in kind of
psychological terms like heart or willpower or that something kind of
got transplanted into us or descended into us and not to remove any of
the spiritual aspects of of sport or running or effort of the human uh
you know heart but it's very clear that the nervous system when it has
a specific</p>

<p>visual target can generate the sorts of intense effort that it
couldn't otherwise and it sometimes even comes as a surprise to the
person generating the effort i promised that i would talk about
programming meaning when and how many times a week to do the various
workouts related to endurance and how to merge those with other types
of exercise that you might be doing for strength or yoga or other
things that you might be doing like work and other things unrelated to
exercise since that's a vast space with many different parameters and
you all have different lives and lifestyles and backgrounds with
fitness etc what i'm going to do is i'm going to put three different
levels if you will or protocols that one could adopt in a link on the
show note so in the caption on youtube if you click on that link
you'll be able to see three possible combinations of endurance work
strength and hypertrophy work or endurance work flexibility and
hypertrophy work that are grounded in many of the major publications
that dr andy galpin and colleagues and other people have described
including this review that's also linked there on concurrent training
and how one can use concurrent training meaning training for endurance
training for strength training for hypertrophy training for all these
different things without having to train constantly every day twice a
day etc so if you are interested in taking the protocols that you
learned about in this episode and in previous episodes and combining
those we've placed them there for you as a completely zero cost
resource please understand they are not holy costello agrees they are
not holy there will be variation in terms of what people can tolerate
what they have time for but i think they'll serve as a useful
guideline in getting started or in continuing with and expanding on
existing endurance work strength work hypertrophy work and so forth
just really quickly we didn't talk about supplements much today in the
previous episodes i talked about</p>
<h1 id="caffeine-magnesium-malate-to-reduce-soreness-nitric-oxide-beta-alanine"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLU7gpk_X8&amp;t=7077">Caffeine, Magnesium Malate to Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine</a></h1>
<p>the phosphocreatine system and supplementing with creatine talked
about beta-alanine for kind of moderate duration work you know really
the only things that have been shown to really improve endurance work
across the four varieties of endurance work i described today they
have essentially two forms one are stimulants so things like caffeine
will definitely improve endurance work and power output there's a
little bit of evidence that caffeine intake can actually inhibit the
function of the creatine system but it's just one study but that's
interesting if you want to read that study you can put caffeine into
examine.com and it will take you to that study many people get sore
after workouts in particular workouts that involve a lot of eccentric
loading or workouts that are very novel where they've kind of pushed
it instead of moving gradually as i suggest into say high intensity
anaerobic endurance work of three sets of 20 seconds on 100 second
rest maybe you get overambitious and you do eight sets in which case
you're extremely sore certain forms of magnesium in particular
magnesium malate m-a-l-a-t-e have been shown to be useful for removing
or reducing the amount of delayed onset muscle soreness that form of
magnesium is distinctly different than the sorts of magnesium that are
good for getting us into sleep things like magnesium 3 and 8 and by
glycinate and then there's this whole thing about beet powder and beet
juices and things that increase nitric oxide and allow for more
vasodilation and therefore delivery of blood to muscle and neurons and
other tissues for long bouts of endurance work some people like beet
juice and the related compounds that increase arginine and
vasodilation some people don't some people don't feel good when they
take those some people also don't feel good when they take beta
alanine because it can give them this feeling of kind of like um itchy
creepy crawlies under the skin kind of the niacin phenomenon the
niacin flush some people don't mind that or some people don't
experience that so when it comes to supplementation there's a lot</p>

<p>of variety but magnesium malate um has been shown to reduce soreness
so sometimes that's good cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness
things of that sort but in general we focused mainly today on
behavioral tools you'll notice that all of the tools are accessible
without the need for lots of equipment so i didn't say you need a
rower you need a kettlebell though those will work and i hope i was
able to illustrate for you that endurance isn't just one thing it's
not just the ability to go for long bouts of exercise of different
kinds that there's also this mental component because of the way that
neurons work and also that there are these different forms of
endurance of muscular endurance that where you're going to fail
because of the muscles and muscle energy utilization and the nerves
that innervate those muscles locally not because of a failure to bring
in oxygen or blood whereas long-duration effort it's going to be more
about you know being below your vo2 max and your ability to be
efficient for long bouts of more than 12 minutes of exercise one set
as they say of 12 minutes to maybe several hours i should just mention
with long duration type work you know you could even imagine raking in
the yard or mowing a lawn depending on how big that lawn is i used to
had a job when i was a kid mowing lawns and i'll tell you we didn't
have many neighbors with very big lawns but um there are a few of them
felt huge because they were really convoluted and if you're pushing
that mower and these were the old-fashioned mowers not electric mowers
it's work that's also of the sort that we call long-duration endurance
work high-intensity training will tap into yet other fuel sources and
mechanisms as we learned today so if you are enjoying this podcast and
you're finding the information useful it would be great if you would
subscribe to the youtube channel that really helps us quite a lot and
if you like you can click click the notifications button on youtube as

you can tell us about topics that you want to hear more about or if
you have questions about a given episode or content within an episode
that's where you want to put that feedback if you're not already
subscribing on apple and spotify as well please do that on apple you
can give us up to a five star review we like to think that you would
give us a five star review but you can also leave comments on apple
about the podcast more generally and again those are all zero cost
ways that you can really help support the podcast we do have a patreon
it is patreon.com andrewhuberman at patreon.comhuberman you can
support the podcast at any level that you like please also check out
our sponsors that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast i know
ad reads are not the first thing that people want to hear when they're
getting ready to consume scientific information please understand that
the ads and the sponsors allow us to bring the zero cost to consumer
information about science and science related tools to everybody so if
you have the means check out the sponsors we only work with sponsors
whose products we really believe in and that i actually use and really
love there's no obligation however and we do talk about supplements
from time to time again no obligation to use supplements we also talk
about behavioral tools but if you are interested in supplements please
go to examine.com to evaluate those supplements and their various
effects if you're curious about that and we work with thorn t-h-o-r-
n-e thorn is a supplement manufacturer that we believe has the highest
levels of stringency in terms of the quality of the supplements and
they are very precise and very stringent about the amounts of each of
those compounds in the given supplements this is a huge problem
elsewhere in the supplement industry many brands don't include what
they say they include on the bottle it seems to show up every time
people test different brands but thorn continually tests out with the
highest levels of accuracy and stringency if you want to see the
supplements that i take you can go to thorne.com the letter u slash
huberman and if you do that you can see all the supplements that i
take you can get 20 off any of those supplements as well if you want
to navigate into the main thorn site and you see a supplement that
you're interested in you'll also get 20 off any of those supplements
as well so that's thorne.com the letter u huberman so we have both
cost free and other ways to help support the podcast if you know
people that might be interested in the podcast and benefit from the
information please recommend it to them that really helps us if you're

also huberman lab and please check out our new website which is
hubermannlab.com there you can find all the episodes of all the
podcasts batched according to topic in every format youtube apple and
spotify with links out to those it's searchable by keywords that
you're interested in so sleep or exercise weight training strength fat
loss etc and you can subscribe to our newsletter the neural network
which will allow you to get zero cost updates about speaking events
about any book releases or exciting things that i'm reading that i
think you would enjoy reading as well as well as protocols related to
science and some summary and important notes from the podcast and last
but not least on behalf of myself and costello who's finally waking up
